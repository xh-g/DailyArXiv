| **[Discrete Diffusion VLA: Bringing Discrete Diffusion to Action Decoding in Vision-Language-Action Policies](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20072v3)** | 2025-12-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models adapt large vision-language backbones to map images and instructions into robot actions. However, prevailing VLAs either generate actions auto-regressively in a fixed left-to-right order or attach separate MLP or diffusion heads outside the backbone, leading to fragmented information pathways and specialized training requirements that hinder a unified, scalable architecture. We present Discrete Diffusion VLA, a unified-transformer policy that models discretized action chunks with discrete diffusion. The design retains diffusion's progressive refinement paradigm while remaining natively compatible with the discrete token interface of VLMs. Our method achieves an adaptive decoding order that resolves easy action elements before harder ones and uses secondary re-masking to revisit uncertain predictions across refinement rounds, which improves consistency and enables robust error correction. This unified decoder preserves pre-trained vision-language priors, supports parallel decoding, breaks the autoregressive bottleneck, and reduces the number of function evaluations. Discrete Diffusion VLA achieves 96.3% avg. success rates on LIBERO, 71.2% visual matching on SimplerEnv-Fractal and 54.2% overall on SimplerEnv-Bridge. We also provide ablation study on vision-language ability retention on LIBERO-OOD (Out-of-Distribution) benchmark, with our method improving over autoregressive, MLP decoder and continuous diffusion baselines. These findings indicate that discrete-diffusion VLA supports precise action modeling and consistent training, laying groundwork for scaling VLA to larger models and datasets. Our code is available at https://github.com/Liang-ZX/DiscreteDiffusionVLA/tree/libero.</p></details> | <details><summary>New e...</summary><p>New experiments on VL retention and new ablations. 18 pages</p></details> |
| **[QDepth-VLA: Quantized Depth Prediction as Auxiliary Supervision for Vision-Language-Action Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14836v2)** | 2025-12-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatial perception and reasoning are crucial for Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models to accomplish fine-grained manipulation tasks. However, existing approaches often lack the ability to understand and reason over the essential 3D structures necessary for precise control. To address this limitation, we propose QDepth-VLA, a general framework that augments VLA models with an auxiliary depth prediction task. A dedicated depth expert is designed to predict quantized latent tokens of depth maps obtained from a VQ-VAE encoder, enabling the model to learn depth-aware representations that capture critical geometric cues. Experimental results on the simulation benchmarks and real-world tasks demonstrate that QDepth-VLA yields strong spatial reasoning and competitive performance on manipulation tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[cVLA: Towards Efficient Camera-Space VLAs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02190v2)** | 2025-12-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models offer a compelling framework for tackling complex robotic manipulation tasks, but they are often expensive to train. In this paper, we propose a novel VLA approach that leverages the competitive performance of Vision Language Models (VLMs) on 2D images to directly infer robot end-effector poses in image frame coordinates. Unlike prior VLA models that output low-level controls, our model predicts trajectory waypoints, making it both more efficient to train and robot embodiment agnostic. Despite its lightweight design, our next-token prediction architecture effectively learns meaningful and executable robot trajectories. We further explore the underutilized potential of incorporating depth images, inference-time techniques such as decoding strategies, and demonstration-conditioned action generation. Our model is trained on a simulated dataset and exhibits strong sim-to-real transfer capabilities. We evaluate our approach using a combination of simulated and real data, demonstrating its effectiveness on a real robotic system.</p></details> | <details><summary>20 pa...</summary><p>20 pages, 10 figures; CoRL 2025 Workshop on Generalizable Priors for Robot Manipulation</p></details> |
| **[Robotic VLA Benefits from Joint Learning with Motion Image Diffusion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18007v1)** | 2025-12-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have achieved remarkable progress in robotic manipulation by mapping multimodal observations and instructions directly to actions. However, they typically mimic expert trajectories without predictive motion reasoning, which limits their ability to reason about what actions to take. To address this limitation, we propose joint learning with motion image diffusion, a novel strategy that enhances VLA models with motion reasoning capabilities. Our method extends the VLA architecture with a dual-head design: while the action head predicts action chunks as in vanilla VLAs, an additional motion head, implemented as a Diffusion Transformer (DiT), predicts optical-flow-based motion images that capture future dynamics. The two heads are trained jointly, enabling the shared VLM backbone to learn representations that couple robot control with motion knowledge. This joint learning builds temporally coherent and physically grounded representations without modifying the inference pathway of standard VLAs, thereby maintaining test-time latency. Experiments in both simulation and real-world environments demonstrate that joint learning with motion image diffusion improves the success rate of pi-series VLAs to 97.5% on the LIBERO benchmark and 58.0% on the RoboTwin benchmark, yielding a 23% improvement in real-world performance and validating its effectiveness in enhancing the motion reasoning capability of large-scale VLAs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Websi...</summary><p>Website: https://vla-motion.github.io/</p></details> |
| **[mimic-video: Video-Action Models for Generalizable Robot Control Beyond VLAs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15692v2)** | 2025-12-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Prevailing Vision-Language-Action Models (VLAs) for robotic manipulation are built upon vision-language backbones pretrained on large-scale, but disconnected static web data. As a result, despite improved semantic generalization, the policy must implicitly infer complex physical dynamics and temporal dependencies solely from robot trajectories. This reliance creates an unsustainable data burden, necessitating continuous, large-scale expert data collection to compensate for the lack of innate physical understanding. We contend that while vision-language pretraining effectively captures semantic priors, it remains blind to physical causality. A more effective paradigm leverages video to jointly capture semantics and visual dynamics during pretraining, thereby isolating the remaining task of low-level control. To this end, we introduce mimic-video, a novel Video-Action Model (VAM) that pairs a pretrained Internet-scale video model with a flow matching-based action decoder conditioned on its latent representations. The decoder serves as an Inverse Dynamics Model (IDM), generating low-level robot actions from the latent representation of video-space action plans. Our extensive evaluation shows that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on simulated and real-world robotic manipulation tasks, improving sample efficiency by 10x and convergence speed by 2x compared to traditional VLA architectures.</p></details> | <details><summary>Revis...</summary><p>Revised Introduction, Related Work, and Appendix.

| **[VLA-AN: An Efficient and Onboard Vision-Language-Action Framework for Aerial Navigation in Complex Environments](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15258v2)** | 2025-12-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper proposes VLA-AN, an efficient and onboard Vision-Language-Action (VLA) framework dedicated to autonomous drone navigation in complex environments. VLA-AN addresses four major limitations of existing large aerial navigation models: the data domain gap, insufficient temporal navigation with reasoning, safety issues with generative action policies, and onboard deployment constraints. First, we construct a high-fidelity dataset utilizing 3D Gaussian Splatting (3D-GS) to effectively bridge the domain gap. Second, we introduce a progressive three-stage training framework that sequentially reinforces scene comprehension, core flight skills, and complex navigation capabilities. Third, we design a lightweight, real-time action module coupled with geometric safety correction. This module ensures fast, collision-free, and stable command generation, mitigating the safety risks inherent in stochastic generative policies. Finally, through deep optimization of the onboard deployment pipeline, VLA-AN achieves a robust real-time 8.3x improvement in inference throughput on resource-constrained UAVs. Extensive experiments demonstrate that VLA-AN significantly improves spatial grounding, scene reasoning, and long-horizon navigation, achieving a maximum single-task success rate of 98.1%, and providing an efficient, practical solution for realizing full-chain closed-loop autonomy in lightweight aerial robots.</p></details> |  |
| **[Phantom Menace: Exploring and Enhancing the Robustness of VLA Models Against Physical Sensor Attacks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10008v2)** | 2025-12-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models revolutionize robotic systems by enabling end-to-end perception-to-action pipelines that integrate multiple sensory modalities, such as visual signals processed by cameras and auditory signals captured by microphones. This multi-modality integration allows VLA models to interpret complex, real-world environments using diverse sensor data streams. Given the fact that VLA-based systems heavily rely on the sensory input, the security of VLA models against physical-world sensor attacks remains critically underexplored. To address this gap, we present the first systematic study of physical sensor attacks against VLAs, quantifying the influence of sensor attacks and investigating the defenses for VLA models. We introduce a novel "Real-Sim-Real" framework that automatically simulates physics-based sensor attack vectors, including six attacks targeting cameras and two targeting microphones, and validates them on real robotic systems. Through large-scale evaluations across various VLA architectures and tasks under varying attack parameters, we demonstrate significant vulnerabilities, with susceptibility patterns that reveal critical dependencies on task types and model designs. We further develop an adversarial-training-based defense that enhances VLA robustness against out-of-distribution physical perturbations caused by sensor attacks while preserving model performance. Our findings expose an urgent need for standardized robustness benchmarks and mitigation strategies to secure VLA deployments in safety-critical environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by AAAI 2026 main track</p></details> |
| **[GeoPredict: Leveraging Predictive Kinematics and 3D Gaussian Geometry for Precise VLA Manipulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16811v1)** | 2025-12-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models achieve strong generalization in robotic manipulation but remain largely reactive and 2D-centric, making them unreliable in tasks that require precise 3D reasoning. We propose GeoPredict, a geometry-aware VLA framework that augments a continuous-action policy with predictive kinematic and geometric priors. GeoPredict introduces a trajectory-level module that encodes motion history and predicts multi-step 3D keypoint trajectories of robot arms, and a predictive 3D Gaussian geometry module that forecasts workspace geometry with track-guided refinement along future keypoint trajectories. These predictive modules serve exclusively as training-time supervision through depth-based rendering, while inference requires only lightweight additional query tokens without invoking any 3D decoding. Experiments on RoboCasa Human-50, LIBERO, and real-world manipulation tasks show that GeoPredict consistently outperforms strong VLA baselines, especially in geometry-intensive and spatially demanding scenarios.</p></details> |  |
| **[EVOLVE-VLA: Test-Time Training from Environment Feedback for Vision-Language-Action Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14666v1)** | 2025-12-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Achieving truly adaptive embodied intelligence requires agents that learn not just by imitating static demonstrations, but by continuously improving through environmental interaction, which is akin to how humans master skills through practice. Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have advanced robotic manipulation by leveraging large language models, yet remain fundamentally limited by Supervised Finetuning (SFT): requiring hundreds of demonstrations per task, rigidly memorizing trajectories, and failing to adapt when deployment conditions deviate from training. We introduce EVOLVE-VLA, a test-time training framework enabling VLAs to continuously adapt through environment interaction with minimal or zero task-specific demonstrations. The key technical challenge is replacing oracle reward signals (unavailable at test time) with autonomous feedback. We address this through a learned progress estimator providing dense feedback, and critically, we design our framework to ``tame'' this inherently noisy signal via two mechanisms: (1) an accumulative progress estimation mechanism smoothing noisy point-wise estimates, and (2) a progressive horizon extension strategy enabling gradual policy evolution. EVOLVE-VLA achieves substantial gains: +8.6\% on long-horizon tasks, +22.0\% in 1-shot learning, and enables cross-task generalization -- achieving 20.8\% success on unseen tasks without task-specific demonstrations training (vs. 0\% for pure SFT). Qualitative analysis reveals emergent capabilities absent in demonstrations, including error recovery and novel strategies. This work represents a critical step toward VLAs that truly learn and adapt, moving beyond static imitation toward continuous self-improvements.</p></details> | 15 pages |
| **[Sample-Efficient Robot Skill Learning for Construction Tasks: Benchmarking Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning and Vision-Language-Action VLA Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14031v1)** | 2025-12-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This study evaluates two leading approaches for teaching construction robots new skills to understand their applicability for construction automation: a Vision-Language-Action (VLA) model and Reinforcement Learning (RL) methods. The goal is to understand both task performance and the practical effort needed to deploy each approach on real jobs. The authors developed two teleoperation interfaces to control the robots and collect the demonstrations needed, both of which proved effective for training robots for long-horizon and dexterous tasks. In addition, the authors conduct a three-stage evaluation. First, the authors compare a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) policy with a Deep Q-network (DQN) imitation model to identify the stronger RL baseline, focusing on model performance, generalization, and a pick-up experiment. Second, three different VLA models are trained in two different scenarios and compared with each other. Third, the authors benchmark the selected RL baseline against the VLA model using computational and sample-efficiency measures and then a robot experiment on a multi-stage panel installation task that includes transport and installation. The VLA model demonstrates strong generalization and few-shot capability, achieving 60% and 100% success in the pickup phase. In comparison, DQN can be made robust but needs additional noise during tuning, which increases the workload. Overall, the findings indicate that VLA offers practical advantages for changing tasks by reducing programming effort and enabling useful performance with minimal data, while DQN provides a viable baseline when sufficient tuning effort is acceptable.</p></details> |  |
| **[Spatial-Aware VLA Pretraining through Visual-Physical Alignment from Human Videos](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13080v1)** | 2025-12-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models provide a promising paradigm for robot learning by integrating visual perception with language-guided policy learning. However, most existing approaches rely on 2D visual inputs to perform actions in 3D physical environments, creating a significant gap between perception and action grounding. To bridge this gap, we propose a Spatial-Aware VLA Pretraining paradigm that performs explicit alignment between visual space and physical space during pretraining, enabling models to acquire 3D spatial understanding before robot policy learning. Starting from pretrained vision-language models, we leverage large-scale human demonstration videos to extract 3D visual and 3D action annotations, forming a new source of supervision that aligns 2D visual observations with 3D spatial reasoning. We instantiate this paradigm with VIPA-VLA, a dual-encoder architecture that incorporates a 3D visual encoder to augment semantic visual representations with 3D-aware features. When adapted to downstream robot tasks, VIPA-VLA achieves significantly improved grounding between 2D vision and 3D action, resulting in more robust and generalizable robotic policies.</p></details> |  |
| **[WholeBodyVLA: Towards Unified Latent VLA for Whole-Body Loco-Manipulation Control](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11047v2)** | 2025-12-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Humanoid robots require precise locomotion and dexterous manipulation to perform challenging loco-manipulation tasks. Yet existing approaches, modular or end-to-end, are deficient in manipulation-aware locomotion. This confines the robot to a limited workspace, preventing it from performing large-space loco-manipulation. We attribute this to: (1) the challenge of acquiring loco-manipulation knowledge due to the scarcity of humanoid teleoperation data, and (2) the difficulty of faithfully and reliably executing locomotion commands, stemming from the limited precision and stability of existing RL controllers. To acquire richer loco-manipulation knowledge, we propose a unified latent learning framework that enables Vision-Language-Action (VLA) system to learn from low-cost action-free egocentric videos. Moreover, an efficient human data collection pipeline is devised to augment the dataset and scale the benefits. To execute the desired locomotion commands more precisely, we present a loco-manipulation-oriented (LMO) RL policy specifically tailored for accurate and stable core loco-manipulation movements, such as advancing, turning, and squatting. Building on these components, we introduce WholeBodyVLA, a unified framework for humanoid loco-manipulation. To the best of our knowledge, WholeBodyVLA is one of its kind enabling large-space humanoid loco-manipulation. It is verified via comprehensive experiments on the AgiBot X2 humanoid, outperforming prior baseline by 21.3%. It also demonstrates strong generalization and high extensibility across a broad range of tasks.</p></details> |  |

While Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models show potential in learning skills from demonstrations, their scalability is limited by scarce high-quality training data. Existing data collection methods face inherent constraints: manual teleoperation overloads human operators, while automated planning often produces unnatural motions. We propose a Shared Autonomy framework that divides control between macro and micro motions. A human operator guides the robot's arm pose through intuitive VR teleoperation, while an autonomous DexGrasp-VLA policy handles fine-grained hand control using real-time tactile and visual feedback. This division significantly reduces cognitive load and enables efficient collection of high-quality coordinated arm-hand demonstrations. Using this data, we train an end-to-end VLA policy enhanced with our novel Arm-Hand Feature Enhancement module, which captures both distinct and shared representations of macro and micro movements for more natural coordination. Our Corrective Teleoperation system enables continuous policy improvement through human-in-the-loop failure recovery. Experiments demonstrate that our framework generates high-quality data with minimal manpower and achieves a 90% success rate across diverse objects, including unseen instances. Comprehensive evaluations validate the system's effectiveness in developing dexterous manipulation capabilities.</p></details> |  |
| **[Atomic Action Slicing: Planner-Aligned Options for Generalist VLA Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11584v1)** | 2025-12-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Current vision-language-action (VLA) models generalize poorly, particularly when tasks require new compositions of skills or objects. We introduce Atomic Action Slicing (AAS), a planner-aligned approach that decomposes long-horizon demonstrations into short, typed atomic actions that are easier for planners to use and policies to learn. Using LIBERO demonstrations, AAS produces a validated dataset of 2,124 atomic segments labeled with action type, temporal span, and confidence. A stronger segmenter (Gemini 2.5 Pro) closely matches planner-defined plans and remains robust under keyframe jitter, while smaller models perform worse on multi-object tasks. Fine-tuning CLIP-RT+ on our atomic dataset improves task success from 94.2% to 95.3% on LIBERO-Goal and 83.8% to 88.8% on LIBERO-Long.

| **[Towards Accessible Physical AI: LoRA-Based Fine-Tuning of VLA Models for Real-World Robot Control](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11921v1)** | 2025-12-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in robotic manipulation,enabling robots to execute natural language commands through end-to-end learning from visual observations.However, deploying large-scale VLA models on affordable robotic platforms remains challenging due to computational constraints and the need for efficient adaptation to new robot embodiments. This paper presents an efficient fine-tuning methodology and real-world deployment analysis for adapting VLA models to low-cost robotic manipulation systems.We propose a resource-efficient fine-tuning strategy using Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) and quantization techniques that enable multi-billion parameter VLA models ( 3.1B parameters) to run on consumer-grade GPUs with 8GB VRAM. Our methodology addresses the critical challenge of adapting pre-trained VLA models to new robot embodiments with limited demonstration data, focusing on the trade-offs between frozen and unfrozen vision encoders. Through real-world deployment on the SO101 robotic arm for a button-pressing manipulation task, we demonstrate that our approach achieves effective manipulation performance while maintaining computational efficiency. We provide detailed analysis of deployment challenges, failure modes, and the relationship between training data quantity and real-world performance,trained on 200 demonstration episodes. Our results show that with proper fine-tuning methodology, VLA models can be successfully deployed on affordable robotic platforms,making advanced manipulation capabilities accessible beyond expensive research robots.</p></details> |  |
| **[HiF-VLA: Hindsight, Insight and Foresight through Motion Representation for Vision-Language-Action Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09928v1)** | 2025-12-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have recently enabled robotic manipulation by grounding visual and linguistic cues into actions. However, most VLAs assume the Markov property, relying only on the current observation and thus suffering from temporal myopia that degrades long-horizon coherence. In this work, we view motion as a more compact and informative representation of temporal context and world dynamics, capturing inter-state changes while filtering static pixel-level noise. Building on this idea, we propose HiF-VLA (Hindsight, Insight, and Foresight for VLAs), a unified framework that leverages motion for bidirectional temporal reasoning. HiF-VLA encodes past dynamics through hindsight priors, anticipates future motion via foresight reasoning, and integrates both through a hindsight-modulated joint expert to enable a ''think-while-acting'' paradigm for long-horizon manipulation. As a result, HiF-VLA surpasses strong baselines on LIBERO-Long and CALVIN ABC-D benchmarks, while incurring negligible additional inference latency. Furthermore, HiF-VLA achieves substantial improvements in real-world long-horizon manipulation tasks, demonstrating its broad effectiveness in practical robotic settings.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://hifvla.github.io Github: https://github.com/OpenHelix-Team/HiF-VLA</p></details> |
| **[PosA-VLA: Enhancing Action Generation via Pose-Conditioned Anchor Attention](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03724v2)** | 2025-12-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have demonstrated remarkable performance on embodied tasks and shown promising potential for real-world applications. However, current VLAs still struggle to produce consistent and precise target-oriented actions, as they often generate redundant or unstable motions along trajectories, limiting their applicability in time-sensitive scenarios.In this work, we attribute these redundant actions to the spatially uniform perception field of existing VLAs, which causes them to be distracted by target-irrelevant objects, especially in complex environments.To address this issue, we propose an efficient PosA-VLA framework that anchors visual attention via pose-conditioned supervision, consistently guiding the model's perception toward task-relevant regions. The pose-conditioned anchor attention mechanism enables the model to better align instruction semantics with actionable visual cues, thereby improving action generation precision and efficiency. Moreover, our framework adopts a lightweight architecture and requires no auxiliary perception modules (e.g., segmentation or grounding networks), ensuring efficient inference. Extensive experiments verify that our method executes embodied tasks with precise and time-efficient behavior across diverse robotic manipulation benchmarks and shows robust generalization in a variety of challenging environments.</p></details> |  |
| **[Affordance Field Intervention: Enabling VLAs to Escape Memory Traps in Robotic Manipulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07472v1)** | 2025-12-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have shown great performance in robotic manipulation by mapping visual observations and language instructions directly to actions. However, they remain brittle under distribution shifts: when test scenarios change, VLAs often reproduce memorized trajectories instead of adapting to the updated scene, which is a failure mode we refer to as the "Memory Trap". This limitation stems from the end-to-end design, which lacks explicit 3D spatial reasoning and prevents reliable identification of actionable regions in unfamiliar environments. To compensate for this missing spatial understanding, 3D Spatial Affordance Fields (SAFs) can provide a geometric representation that highlights where interactions are physically feasible, offering explicit cues about regions the robot should approach or avoid. We therefore introduce Affordance Field Intervention (AFI), a lightweight hybrid framework that uses SAFs as an on-demand plug-in to guide VLA behavior. Our system detects memory traps through proprioception, repositions the robot to recent high-affordance regions, and proposes affordance-driven waypoints that anchor VLA-generated actions. A SAF-based scorer then selects trajectories with the highest cumulative affordance. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves an average improvement of 23.5% across different VLA backbones ($π_{0}$ and $π_{0.5}$) under out-of-distribution scenarios on real-world robotic platforms, and 20.2% on the LIBERO-Pro benchmark, validating its effectiveness in enhancing VLA robustness to distribution shifts.</p></details> |  |
| **[WAM-Diff: A Masked Diffusion VLA Framework with MoE and Online Reinforcement Learning for Autonomous Driving](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11872v1)** | 2025-12-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>End-to-end autonomous driving systems based on vision-language-action (VLA) models integrate multimodal sensor inputs and language instructions to generate planning and control signals. While autoregressive large language models and continuous diffusion policies are prevalent, the potential of discrete masked diffusion for trajectory generation remains largely unexplored. This paper presents WAM-Diff, a VLA framework that employs masked diffusion to iteratively refine a discrete sequence representing future ego-trajectories. Our approach features three key innovations: a systematic adaptation of masked diffusion for autonomous driving that supports flexible, non-causal decoding orders; scalable model capacity via a sparse MoE architecture trained jointly on motion prediction and driving-oriented visual question answering (VQA); and online reinforcement learning using Group Sequence Policy Optimization (GSPO) to optimize sequence-level driving rewards. Remarkably, our model achieves 91.0 PDMS on NAVSIM-v1 and 89.7 EPDMS on NAVSIM-v2, demonstrating the effectiveness of masked diffusion for autonomous driving. The approach provides a promising alternative to autoregressive and diffusion-based policies, supporting scenario-aware decoding strategies for trajectory generation.

Recent approaches have sought to address this challenge by training on large collections of heterogeneous robotic datasets. However, unlike vision or language data, robotic demonstrations exhibit substantial heterogeneity across embodiments and action spaces as well as other prominent variations such as senor configurations and action control frequencies. The lack of explicit designs for handling such heterogeneity causes existing methods to struggle with integrating diverse factors, thereby limiting their generalization and leading to degraded performance when transferred to new settings. In this paper, we present HiMoE-VLA, a novel vision-language-action (VLA) framework tailored to effectively handle diverse robotic data with heterogeneity. Specifically, we introduce a Hierarchical Mixture-of-Experts (HiMoE) architecture for the action module which adaptively handles multiple sources of heterogeneity across layers and gradually abstracts them into shared knowledge representations. Through extensive experimentation with simulation benchmarks and real-world robotic platforms, HiMoE-VLA demonstrates a consistent performance boost over existing VLA baselines, achieving higher accuracy and robust generalization across diverse robots and action spaces.

| **[STARE-VLA: Progressive Stage-Aware Reinforcement for Fine-Tuning Vision-Language-Action Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05107v1)** | 2025-12-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models, powered by large language models and reinforcement learning-based fine-tuning, have shown remarkable progress in robotic manipulation. Existing methods often treat long-horizon actions as linguistic sequences and apply trajectory-level optimization methods such as Trajectory-wise Preference Optimization (TPO) or Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), leading to coarse credit assignment and unstable training. However, unlike language, where a unified semantic meaning is preserved despite flexible sentence order, action trajectories progress through causally chained stages with different learning difficulties. This motivates progressive stage optimization. Thereby, we present Stage-Aware Reinforcement (STARE), a module that decomposes a long-horizon action trajectory into semantically meaningful stages and provides dense, interpretable, and stage-aligned reinforcement signals. Integrating STARE into TPO and PPO, we yield Stage-Aware TPO (STA-TPO) and Stage-Aware PPO (STA-PPO) for offline stage-wise preference and online intra-stage interaction, respectively. Further building on supervised fine-tuning as initialization, we propose the Imitation -> Preference -> Interaction (IPI), a serial fine-tuning pipeline for improving action accuracy in VLA models. Experiments on SimplerEnv and ManiSkill3 demonstrate substantial gains, achieving state-of-the-art success rates of 98.0 percent on SimplerEnv and 96.4 percent on ManiSkill3 tasks.</p></details> |  |

However, traditional perception-planning pipelines often fall short in open-ended tasks due to limited flexibility, while the architecture of a single end-to-end Vision-Language-Action (VLA) offers promising capabilities but lacks crucial mechanisms for anticipating and recovering from failure. To address these challenges, we propose FPC-VLA, a dual-model framework that integrates VLA with a supervisor for failure prediction and correction. The supervisor evaluates action viability through vision-language queries and generates corrective strategies when risks arise, trained efficiently without manual labeling. A dual-stream fusion module further refines actions by leveraging past predictions. Evaluation results on multiple simulation platforms (SIMPLER and LIBERO) and robot embodiments (WidowX, Google Robot, Franka) show that FPC-VLA outperforms state-of-the-art models in both zero-shot and fine-tuned settings. Successful real-world deployments on diverse, long-horizon tasks confirm FPC-VLA's strong generalization and practical utility for building more reliable autonomous systems.</p></details> |  |

We show that this brittleness primarily arises from misalignment in Spatial Modeling, rather than Physical Modeling. To address this, we propose a one-shot adaptation framework that recalibrates visual representations through lightweight, learnable updates. Our first method, Feature Token Modulation (FTM), applies a global affine transformation to visual tokens and improves Libero viewpoint accuracy from 48.5% to 87.1% with only 4K parameters. Building on this, Feature Linear Adaptation (FLA) introduces low-rank updates to the ViT encoder, achieving 90.8% success with 4.7M parameters -- matching LoRA-scale finetuning at far lower cost. Together, these results reveal substantial untapped robustness in pretrained VLA models and demonstrate that targeted, minimal visual adaptation is sufficient to restore viewpoint generalization.</p></details> |  |
| **[AVA-VLA: Improving Vision-Language-Action models with Active Visual Attention](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18960v2)** | 2025-12-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in embodied AI tasks. However, existing VLA models, often built upon Vision-Language Models (VLMs), typically process dense visual inputs independently at each timestep. This approach implicitly models the task as a Markov Decision Process (MDP). However, this history-agnostic design is suboptimal for effective visual token processing in dynamic sequential decision-making, as it fails to leverage the context of history. To address this limitation, we reformulate the problem from a Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP) perspective and propose a novel framework named AVA-VLA. Inspired by the POMDP that the action generation should be conditioned on the belief state. AVA-VLA introduces Active Visual Attention (AVA) to dynamically modulate visual processing. It achieves this by leveraging the recurrent state, which is a neural approximation of the agent's belief state derived from the previous decision step. Specifically, the AVA module uses the recurrent state to compute the soft weights to actively process task-relevant visual tokens based on its historical context. Comprehensive evaluations demonstrate that AVA-VLA achieves state-of-the-art performance across popular robotic benchmarks, including LIBERO and CALVIN. Furthermore, real-world deployments on a dual-arm robot platform validate the framework's practical applicability and robust sim-to-real transferability.</p></details> | 18 pages, 10 figures |
| **[ManualVLA: A Unified VLA Model for Chain-of-Thought Manual Generation and Robotic Manipulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02013v1)** | 2025-12-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have recently emerged, demonstrating strong generalization in robotic scene understanding and manipulation. However, when confronted with long-horizon tasks that require defined goal states, such as LEGO assembly or object rearrangement, existing VLA models still face challenges in coordinating high-level planning with precise manipulation. Therefore, we aim to endow a VLA model with the capability to infer the "how" process from the "what" outcomes, transforming goal states into executable procedures. In this paper, we introduce ManualVLA, a unified VLA framework built upon a Mixture-of-Transformers (MoT) architecture, enabling coherent collaboration between multimodal manual generation and action execution. Unlike prior VLA models that directly map sensory inputs to actions, we first equip ManualVLA with a planning expert that generates intermediate manuals consisting of images, position prompts, and textual instructions. Building upon these multimodal manuals, we design a Manual Chain-of-Thought (ManualCoT) reasoning process that feeds them into the action expert, where each manual step provides explicit control conditions, while its latent representation offers implicit guidance for accurate manipulation. To alleviate the burden of data collection, we develop a high-fidelity digital-twin toolkit based on 3D Gaussian Splatting, which automatically generates manual data for planning expert training. ManualVLA demonstrates strong real-world performance, achieving an average success rate 32% higher than the previous hierarchical SOTA baseline on LEGO assembly and object rearrangement tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[DiG-Flow: Discrepancy-Guided Flow Matching for Robust VLA Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01715v1)** | 2025-12-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models trained with flow matching have demonstrated impressive capabilities on robotic manipulation tasks. However, their performance often degrades under distribution shift and on complex multi-step tasks, suggesting that the learned representations may not robustly capture task-relevant semantics. We introduce DiG-Flow, a principled framework that enhances VLA robustness through geometric regularization. Our key insight is that the distributional discrepancy between observation and action embeddings provides a meaningful geometric signal: lower transport cost indicates compatible representations, while higher cost suggests potential misalignment. DiG-Flow computes a discrepancy measure between empirical distributions of observation and action embeddings, maps it to a modulation weight via a monotone function, and applies residual updates to the observation embeddings before flow matching. Crucially, this intervention operates at the representation level without modifying the flow matching path or target vector field. We provide theoretical guarantees showing that discrepancy-guided training provably decreases the training objective, and that guided inference refinement converges with contraction. Empirically, DiG-Flow integrates into existing VLA architectures with negligible overhead and consistently improves performance, with particularly pronounced gains on complex multi-step tasks and under limited training data.</p></details> |  |

However, the interpretability and coherence of the decision process and the plausibility of action sequences remain largely underexplored. To address these issues, we propose AutoDrive-R$^2$, a novel VLA framework that enhances both reasoning and self-reflection capabilities of autonomous driving systems through chain-of-thought (CoT) processing and reinforcement learning (RL). Specifically, we first propose an innovative CoT dataset named nuScenesR$^2$-6K for supervised fine-tuning, which effectively builds cognitive bridges between input information and output trajectories through a four-step logical chain with self-reflection for validation. Moreover, to maximize both reasoning and self-reflection during the RL stage, we further employ the Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) algorithm within a physics-grounded reward framework that incorporates spatial alignment, vehicle dynamic, and temporal smoothness criteria to ensure reliable and realistic trajectory planning. Extensive evaluation results across both nuScenes and Waymo datasets demonstrates the state-of-the-art performance and robust generalization capacity of our proposed method.</p></details> |  |
| **[VLASH: Real-Time VLAs via Future-State-Aware Asynchronous Inference](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01031v1)** | 2025-11-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-Language-Action models (VLAs) are becoming increasingly capable across diverse robotic tasks. However, their real-world deployment remains slow and inefficient: demonstration videos are often sped up by 5-10x to appear smooth, with noticeable action stalls and delayed reactions to environmental changes. Asynchronous inference offers a promising solution to achieve continuous and low-latency control by enabling robots to execute actions and perform inference simultaneously. However, because the robot and environment continue to evolve during inference, a temporal misalignment arises between the prediction and execution intervals. This leads to significant action instability, while existing methods either degrade accuracy or introduce runtime overhead to mitigate it. We propose VLASH, a general asynchronous inference framework for VLAs that delivers smooth, accurate, and fast reaction control without additional overhead or architectural changes. VLASH estimates the future execution-time state by rolling the robot state forward with the previously generated action chunk, thereby bridging the gap between prediction and execution. Experiments show that VLASH achieves up to 2.03x speedup and reduces reaction latency by up to 17.4x compared to synchronous inference while fully preserving the original accuracy. Moreover, it empowers VLAs to handle fast-reaction, high-precision tasks such as playing ping-pong and playing whack-a-mole, where traditional synchronous inference fails.

To mitigate this issue, using a lightweight VLM has been explored, but it compromises spatiotemporal reasoning. Although some methods suggest that incorporating additional 3D inputs can help, they usually rely on large VLMs to fuse 3D and 2D inputs and still lack temporal understanding. Therefore, we propose SwiftVLA, an architecture that enhances a compact model with 4D understanding while preserving design efficiency. Specifically, our approach features a pretrained 4D visual geometry transformer with a temporal cache that extracts 4D features from 2D images. Then, to enhance the VLM's ability to exploit both 2D images and 4D features, we introduce Fusion Tokens, a set of learnable tokens trained with a future prediction objective to generate unified representations for action generation. Finally, we introduce a mask-and-reconstruct strategy that masks 4D inputs to the VLM and trains the VLA to reconstruct them, enabling the VLM to learn effective 4D representations and allowing the 4D branch to be dropped at inference with minimal performance loss. Experiments in real and simulated environments show that SwiftVLA outperforms lightweight baselines and rivals VLAs up to 7 times larger, achieving comparable performance on edge devices while being 18 times faster and reducing memory footprint by 12 times.</p></details> |  |

Among existing approaches, a majority of current VLA systems employ parallel two finger grippers as their default end effectors. However, such grippers face inherent limitations in handling certain real world tasks such as wiping glass surfaces or opening drawers without handles due to insufficient contact area or lack of adhesion. To overcome these challenges, we present a low cost, integrated hardware design that combines a mechanical two finger gripper with a vacuum suction unit, enabling dual mode manipulation within a single end effector. Our system supports flexible switching or synergistic use of both modalities, expanding the range of feasible tasks. We validate the efficiency and practicality of our design within two state of the art VLA frameworks: DexVLA and Pi0. Experimental results demonstrate that with the proposed hybrid end effector, robots can successfully perform multiple complex tasks that are infeasible for conventional two finger grippers alone. All hardware designs and controlling systems will be released.</p></details> | 8 pages |

Yet existing VLA models still struggle to generalize across diverse tasks, scenes, and camera viewpoints, and often produce coarse or unstable actions. We introduce E0, a continuized discrete diffusion framework that formulates action generation as iterative denoising over quantized action tokens. Compared with continuous diffusion policies, E0 offers two key advantages: (1) discrete action tokens align naturally with the symbolic structure of pretrained VLM/VLA backbones, enabling stronger semantic conditioning; and 2. discrete diffusion matches the true quantized nature of real-world robot control-whose hardware constraints (e.g., encoder resolution, control frequency, actuation latency) inherently discretize continuous signals-and therefore benefits from a Bayes-optimal denoiser that models the correct discrete action distribution, leading to stronger generalization. Compared with discrete autoregressive and mask-based discrete diffusion models, E0 supports a significantly larger and finer-grained action vocabulary and avoids the distributional mismatch introduced by masking-based corruptions-yielding more accurate fine-grained action control. We further introduce a spherical viewpoint perturbation augmentation method to improve robustness to camera shifts without additional data. Experiments on LIBERO, VLABench, and ManiSkill show that E0 achieves state-of-the-art performance across 14 diverse environments, outperforming strong baselines by 10.7% on average. Real-world evaluation on a Franka arm confirms that E0 delivers precise, robust, and transferable manipulation, establishing discrete diffusion as a promising direction for generalizable VLA policy learning.</p></details> |  |

Our method first trains a lightweight motion tokenizer to encode motion dynamics, then employs an unsupervised action segmenter leveraging a novel "Latent Action Energy" metric to discover and segment semantically coherent action primitives. The pipeline outputs both segmented video clips and their corresponding latent action sequences, providing structured data directly suitable for VLA pre-training. Evaluations on public benchmarks and a proprietary electric motor assembly dataset demonstrate effective segmentation of key tasks performed by humans at workstations. Further clustering and quantitative assessment via a Vision-Language Model confirm the semantic coherence of the discovered action primitives. To our knowledge, this is the first fully automated end-to-end system for extracting and organizing VLA pre-training data from unstructured industrial videos, offering a scalable solution for embodied AI integration in manufacturing.</p></details> | 10 pages, 5 figures |

Recent approaches have shifted from focusing solely on common scenarios to addressing complex, long-tail situations such as subtle human behaviors, traffic accidents, and non-compliant driving patterns. Given the demonstrated capabilities of large language models (LLMs) in understanding visual and natural language inputs and following instructions, recent methods have integrated LLMs into autonomous driving systems to enhance reasoning, interpretability, and performance across diverse scenarios. However, existing methods typically rely either on real-world data, which is suitable for industrial deployment, or on simulation data tailored to rare or hard case scenarios. Few approaches effectively integrate the complementary advantages of both data sources. To address this limitation, we propose a novel VLM-guided, end-to-end adversarial transfer framework for autonomous driving that transfers long-tail handling capabilities from simulation to real-world deployment, named CoC-VLA. The framework comprises a teacher VLM model, a student VLM model, and a discriminator. Both the teacher and student VLM models utilize a shared base architecture, termed the Chain-of-Causality Visual-Language Model (CoC VLM), which integrates temporal information via an end-to-end text adapter. This architecture supports chain-of-thought reasoning to infer complex driving logic. The teacher and student VLM models are pre-trained separately on simulated and real-world datasets. The discriminator is trained adversarially to facilitate the transfer of long-tail handling capabilities from simulated to real-world environments by the student VLM model, using a novel backpropagation strategy.</p></details> |  |

However, existing VLAs often struggle with achieving efficient inference and generalizing to novel autonomous vehicle configurations and driving scenarios. In this paper, we propose Reasoning-VLA, a general and fast action-generation VLA framework. The proposed model employs a set of learnable action queries, initialized via Gaussian sampling from ground-truth trajectories within the training corpus. These learnable queries interact with reasoning-enhanced vision-language features to generate continuous action trajectories in parallel. To promote robust generalization, we consolidate eight publicly available autonomous driving datasets into a standardized, Chain-of-Thought reasoning-based, and easy-to-use data format for model training. Leveraging both supervised learning and reinforcement learning fine-tuning, extensive empirical evaluations across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that Reasoning-VLA achieves state-of-the-art performance, superior generalization capability, and the excellent inference speed reported to date.</p></details> |  |
| **[Compressor-VLA: Instruction-Guided Visual Token Compression for Efficient Robotic Manipulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18950v1)** | 2025-11-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have emerged as a powerful paradigm in Embodied AI. However, the significant computational overhead of processing redundant visual tokens remains a critical bottleneck for real-time robotic deployment. While standard token pruning techniques can alleviate this, these task-agnostic methods struggle to preserve task-critical visual information. To address this challenge, simultaneously preserving both the holistic context and fine-grained details for precise action, we propose Compressor-VLA, a novel hybrid instruction-conditioned token compression framework designed for efficient, task-oriented compression of visual information in VLA models. The proposed Compressor-VLA framework consists of two token compression modules: a Semantic Task Compressor (STC) that distills holistic, task-relevant context, and a Spatial Refinement Compressor (SRC) that preserves fine-grained spatial details. This compression is dynamically modulated by the natural language instruction, allowing for the adaptive condensation of task-relevant visual information. Experimentally, extensive evaluations demonstrate that Compressor-VLA achieves a competitive success rate on the LIBERO benchmark while reducing FLOPs by 59% and the visual token count by over 3x compared to its baseline. The real-robot deployments on a dual-arm robot platform validate the model's sim-to-real transferability and practical applicability. Moreover, qualitative analyses reveal that our instruction guidance dynamically steers the model's perceptual focus toward task-relevant objects, thereby validating the effectiveness of our approach.</p></details> | 11 pages, 5 figures |

Recent methods have focused on scaling backbone architectures to improve generalization, with less emphasis on addressing inference inefficiencies essential for real-time use. In this work, we present KV-Efficient VLA, a model-agnostic memory compression approach designed to address these limitations by introducing a lightweight mechanism to selectively retain high-utility context. Our method partitions the KV cache into fixed-size chunks and employs a recurrent gating module to summarize and filter the historical context according to learned utility scores. This design aims to preserve recent fine-grained detail while aggressively pruning stale, low-relevance memory. Based on experiments, our approach can yield an average of 24.6% FLOPs savings, 1.34x inference speedup, and 1.87x reduction in KV memory. Our method integrates seamlessly into recent VLA stacks, enabling scalable inference without modifying downstream control logic.</p></details> |  |

Typically, existing methods embed 3D positions into visual representations to enhance the spatial precision of actions. However, these methods struggle to achieve temporally coherent control over action execution. In this work, we propose VLA-4D, a general VLA model with 4D awareness for spatiotemporally coherent robotic manipulation. Our model is guided by two key designs: 1) 4D-aware visual representation. We extract visual features, embed 1D time into 3D positions for 4D embeddings, and fuse them into a unified visual representation via a cross-attention mechanism. 2) Spatiotemporal action representation. We extend conventional spatial action representations with temporal information to enable the spatiotemporal planning, and align the multimodal representations into the LLM for spatiotemporal action prediction. Within this unified framework, the designed visual and action representations jointly make robotic manipulation spatially-smooth and temporally-coherent. In addition, we extend the VLA dataset with temporal action annotations for fine-tuning our model. Extensive experiments have been conducted to verify the superiority of our method across different tasks of robotic manipulation.</p></details> |  |

Token pruning (keeping salient visual tokens and dropping redundant ones) has emerged as an effective approach for accelerating Vision-Language Models (VLMs), offering a solution for efficient VLA. However, these VLM-specific token pruning methods select tokens based solely on semantic salience metrics (e.g., prefill attention), while overlooking the VLA's intrinsic dual-system nature of high-level semantic understanding and low-level action execution. Consequently, these methods bias token retention toward semantic cues, discard critical information for action generation, and significantly degrade VLA performance. To bridge this gap, we propose VLA-Pruner, a versatile plug-and-play VLA-specific token prune method that aligns with the dual-system nature of VLA models and exploits the temporal continuity in robot manipulation. Specifically, VLA-Pruner adopts a dual-level importance criterion for visual token retention: vision-language prefill attention for semantic-level relevance and action decode attention, estimated via temporal smoothing, for action-level importance. Based on this criterion, VLA-Pruner proposes a novel dual-level token selection strategy that adaptively preserves a compact, informative set of visual tokens for both semantic understanding and action execution under given compute budget. Experiments show that VLA-Pruner achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple VLA architectures and diverse robotic tasks.</p></details> |  |

Existing model-centric optimization paths, such as model compression (which often leads to performance degradation) or policy distillation (whose products are model-dependent and lack generality), fail to fundamentally address this data-level challenge. To this end, this paper introduces FT-NCFM, a fundamentally different, data-centric generative data distillation framework. Our framework employs a self-contained Fact-Tracing (FT) engine that combines causal attribution with programmatic contrastive verification to assess the intrinsic value of samples. Guided by these assessments, an adversarial NCFM process synthesizes a model-agnostic, information-dense, and reusable data asset. Experimental results on several mainstream VLA benchmarks show that models trained on just 5% of our distilled coreset achieve a success rate of 85-90% compared with training on the full dataset, while reducing training time by over 80%. Our work demonstrates that intelligent data distillation is a highly promising new path for building efficient, high-performance VLA models.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at the AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence (AAAI-26)</p></details> |

We present a general-purpose method, RL with Experience and Corrections via Advantage-conditioned Policies (RECAP), that provides for RL training of VLAs via advantage conditioning. Our method incorporates heterogeneous data into the self-improvement process, including demonstrations, data from on-policy collection, and expert teleoperated interventions provided during autonomous execution. RECAP starts by pre-training a generalist VLA with offline RL, which we call $π^{*}_{0.6}$, that can then be specialized to attain high performance on downstream tasks through on-robot data collection. We show that the $π^{*}_{0.6}$ model trained with the full RECAP method can fold laundry in real homes, reliably assemble boxes, and make espresso drinks using a professional espresso machine. On some of the hardest tasks, RECAP more than doubles task throughput and roughly halves the task failure rate.</p></details> |  |

We address the challenge of mapping natural language instructions and one or more RGBD observations to quasi-static robot actions. 3D-aware robot policies achieve state-of-the-art performance on precise robot manipulation tasks, but struggle with generalization to unseen instructions, scenes, and objects. On the other hand, VLAs excel at generalizing across instructions and scenes, but can be sensitive to camera and robot pose variations. We leverage prior knowledge embedded in language and vision foundation models to improve generalization of 3D-aware keyframe policies. OG-VLA unprojects input observations from diverse views into a point cloud which is then rendered from canonical orthographic views, ensuring input view invariance and consistency between input and output spaces. These canonical views are processed with a vision backbone, a Large Language Model (LLM), and an image diffusion model to generate images that encode the next position and orientation of the end-effector on the input scene. Evaluations on the Arnold and Colosseum benchmarks demonstrate state-of-the-art generalization to unseen environments, with over 40% relative improvements while maintaining robust performance in seen settings. We also show real-world adaption in 3 to 5 demonstrations along with strong generalization. Videos and resources at https://og-vla.github.io/</p></details> | 13 pages |

Existing methods typically model the dataset's action distribution using simple observations as inputs. However, these inputs are often incomplete, resulting in a dispersed conditional action distribution-an issue we refer to as coordinate system chaos and state chaos. This inconsistency significantly hampers pretraining efficiency. To address this, we propose 4D-VLA, a novel approach that effectively integrates 4D information into the input to mitigate these sources of chaos. Our model introduces depth and temporal information into visual features with sequential RGB-D inputs, aligning the coordinate systems of the robot and the scene. This alignment endows the model with strong spatiotemporal reasoning capabilities while minimizing training overhead. Additionally, we introduce memory bank sampling, a frame sampling strategy designed to extract informative frames from historical images, further improving effectiveness and efficiency. Experimental results demonstrate that our pretraining method and architectural components substantially enhance model performance. In both simulated and real-world experiments, our model achieves a significant increase in success rate over OpenVLA. To further assess spatial perception and generalization to novel views, we introduce MV-Bench, a multi-view simulation benchmark. Our model consistently outperforms existing methods, demonstrating stronger spatial understanding and adaptability.</p></details> |  |

In particular, end-to-end autonomous driving in unstructured outdoor environments often encounters conditions that were unfamiliar during training. In this work, we present Vision-Language Action Retrieval (VLA-R), an open-world end-to-end autonomous driving (OW-E2EAD) framework that integrates open-world perception with a novel vision-action retrieval paradigm. We leverage a frozen vision-language model for open-world detection and segmentation to obtain multi-scale, prompt-guided, and interpretable perception features without domain-specific tuning. A Q-Former bottleneck aggregates fine-grained visual representations with language-aligned visual features, bridging perception and action domains. To learn transferable driving behaviors, we introduce a vision-action contrastive learning scheme that aligns vision-language and action embeddings for effective open-world reasoning and action retrieval.

This frame-by-frame processing makes models vulnerable to visual noise while ignoring the substantial coherence between consecutive frames in manipulation sequences. We propose Temporal Token Fusion (TTF), a training-free approach that intelligently integrates historical and current visual representations to enhance VLA inference quality. Our method employs dual-dimension detection combining efficient grayscale pixel difference analysis with attention-based semantic relevance assessment, enabling selective temporal token fusion through hard fusion strategies and keyframe anchoring to prevent error accumulation. Comprehensive experiments across LIBERO, SimplerEnv, and real robot tasks demonstrate consistent improvements: 4.0 percentage points average on LIBERO (72.4\% vs 68.4\% baseline), cross-environment validation on SimplerEnv (4.8\% relative improvement), and 8.7\% relative improvement on real robot tasks. Our approach proves model-agnostic, working across OpenVLA and VLA-Cache architectures. Notably, TTF reveals that selective Query matrix reuse in attention mechanisms enhances rather than compromises performance, suggesting promising directions for direct KQV matrix reuse strategies that achieve computational acceleration while improving task success rates.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to AAAI 2026.

This paper proposes Audio-VLA, a multimodal manipulation policy that leverages contact audio to perceive contact events and dynamic process feedback. Audio-VLA overcomes the vision-only constraints of VLA models. Additionally, this paper introduces the Task Completion Rate (TCR) metric to systematically evaluate dynamic operational processes. Audio-VLA employs pre-trained DINOv2 and SigLIP as visual encoders, AudioCLIP as the audio encoder, and Llama2 as the large language model backbone. We apply LoRA fine-tuning to these pre-trained modules to achieve robust cross-modal understanding of both visual and acoustic inputs. A multimodal projection layer aligns features from different modalities into the same feature space. Moreover RLBench and LIBERO simulation environments are enhanced by adding collision-based audio generation to provide realistic sound feedback during object interactions. Since current robotic manipulation evaluations focus on final outcomes rather than providing systematic assessment of dynamic operational processes, the proposed TCR metric measures how well robots perceive dynamic processes during manipulation, creating a more comprehensive evaluation metric. Extensive experiments on LIBERO, RLBench, and two real-world tasks demonstrate Audio-VLA's superior performance over vision-only comparative methods, while the TCR metric effectively quantifies dynamic process perception capabilities.</p></details> |  |
| **[MAP-VLA: Memory-Augmented Prompting for Vision-Language-Action Model in Robotic Manipulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09516v1)** | 2025-11-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Pre-trained Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have achieved remarkable success in improving robustness and generalization for end-to-end robotic manipulation. However, these models struggle with long-horizon tasks due to their lack of memory and reliance solely on immediate sensory inputs. To address this limitation, we propose Memory-Augmented Prompting for Vision-Language-Action model (MAP-VLA), a novel framework that empowers pre-trained VLA models with demonstration-derived memory prompts to augment action generation for long-horizon robotic manipulation tasks. To achieve this, MAP-VLA first constructs a memory library from historical demonstrations, where each memory unit captures information about a specific stage of a task. These memory units are implemented as learnable soft prompts optimized through prompt tuning. Then, during real-time task execution, MAP-VLA retrieves relevant memory through trajectory similarity matching and dynamically integrates it into the VLA model for augmented action generation. Importantly, this prompt tuning and retrieval augmentation approach operates as a plug-and-play module for a frozen VLA model, offering a lightweight and flexible solution to improve task performance. Experimental results show that MAP-VLA delivers up to 7.0% absolute performance gains in the simulation benchmark and 25.0% on real robot evaluations for long-horizon tasks, surpassing the current state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> |  |

In addition, foundational datasets, benchmarks, and simulation platforms are introduced. Building on the current VLA landscape, the review further proposes perspectives on key challenges and future directions to advance research in VLA models and generalizable robotics. By synthesizing insights from over three hundred recent studies, this survey maps the contours of this rapidly evolving field and highlights the opportunities and challenges that will shape the development of scalable, general-purpose VLA methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[How Do VLAs Effectively Inherit from VLMs?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06619v1)** | 2025-11-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-language-action (VLA) models hold the promise to attain generalizable embodied control. To achieve this, a pervasive paradigm is to leverage the rich vision-semantic priors of large vision-language models (VLMs). However, the fundamental question persists: How do VLAs effectively inherit the prior knowledge from VLMs? To address this critical question, we introduce a diagnostic benchmark, GrinningFace, an emoji tabletop manipulation task where the robot arm is asked to place objects onto printed emojis corresponding to language instructions. This task design is particularly revealing -- knowledge associated with emojis is ubiquitous in Internet-scale datasets used for VLM pre-training, yet emojis themselves are largely absent from standard robotics datasets. Consequently, they provide a clean proxy: successful task completion indicates effective transfer of VLM priors to embodied control. We implement this diagnostic task in both simulated environment and a real robot, and compare various promising techniques for knowledge transfer. Specifically, we investigate the effects of parameter-efficient fine-tuning, VLM freezing, co-training, predicting discretized actions, and predicting latent actions. Through systematic evaluation, our work not only demonstrates the critical importance of preserving VLM priors for the generalization of VLA but also establishes guidelines for future research in developing truly generalizable embodied AI systems.</p></details> |  |

In many real-world applications, consistent high performance on a limited set of tasks is more important than broad generalization. We propose ExpReS-VLA, a method for specializing pre-trained VLA models through experience replay and retrieval while preventing catastrophic forgetting. ExpReS-VLA stores compact feature representations from the frozen vision backbone instead of raw image-action pairs, reducing memory usage by approximately 97 percent. During deployment, relevant past experiences are retrieved using cosine similarity and used to guide adaptation, while prioritized experience replay emphasizes successful trajectories. We also introduce Thresholded Hybrid Contrastive Loss, which enables learning from both successful and failed attempts. On the LIBERO simulation benchmark, ExpReS-VLA improves success rates from 82.6 to 93.1 percent on spatial reasoning tasks and from 61 to 72.3 percent on long-horizon tasks. On physical robot experiments with five manipulation tasks, it reaches 98 percent success on both seen and unseen settings, compared to 84.7 and 32 percent for naive fine-tuning. Adaptation takes 31 seconds using 12 demonstrations on a single RTX 5090 GPU, making the approach practical for real robot deployment.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 5 figures, submitted to ICRA 2026.

We introduce GeoAware-VLA, a simple yet effective approach that enhances viewpoint invariance by integrating strong geometric priors into the vision backbone. Instead of training a visual encoder or relying on explicit 3D data, we leverage a frozen, pretrained geometric vision model as a feature extractor. A trainable projection layer then adapts these geometrically-rich features for the policy decoder, relieving it of the burden of learning 3D consistency from scratch. Through extensive evaluations on LIBERO benchmark subsets, we show GeoAware-VLA achieves substantial improvements in zero-shot generalization to novel camera poses, boosting success rates by over 2x in simulation. Crucially, these benefits translate to the physical world; our model shows a significant performance gain on a real robot, especially when evaluated from unseen camera angles. Our approach proves effective across both continuous and discrete action spaces, highlighting that robust geometric grounding is a key component for creating more generalizable robotic agents.</p></details> | <details><summary>Under...</summary><p>Under Review, Project Page https://alisharey.github.io/GeoAware-VLA/</p></details> |

Existing solutions often apply end-to-end imitation learning with Vision-Language Action (VLA) models or symbolic approaches with Action Model Learning (AML). On the one hand, current VLA models are limited by the lack of high-level symbolic planning, which hinders their abilities in long-horizon tasks. On the other hand, symbolic approaches in AML lack generalization and scalability perspectives. In this paper we present a new neuro-symbolic approach, GraSP-VLA, a framework that uses a Continuous Scene Graph representation to generate a symbolic representation of human demonstrations. This representation is used to generate new planning domains during inference and serves as an orchestrator for low-level VLA policies, scaling up the number of actions that can be reproduced in a row. Our results show that GraSP-VLA is effective for modeling symbolic representations on the task of automatic planning domain generation from observations. In addition, results on real-world experiments show the potential of our Continuous Scene Graph representation to orchestrate low-level VLA policies in long-horizon tasks.</p></details> |  |

However, most existing models rely solely on RGB cameras, limiting their perception and, consequently, manipulation capabilities. We present OmniVLA, an omni-modality VLA model that integrates novel sensing modalities for physically-grounded spatial intelligence beyond RGB perception. The core of our approach is the sensor-masked image, a unified representation that overlays spatially grounded and physically meaningful masks onto the RGB images, derived from sensors including an infrared camera, a mmWave radar, and a microphone array. This image-native unification keeps sensor input close to RGB statistics to facilitate training, provides a uniform interface across sensor hardware, and enables data-efficient learning with lightweight per-sensor projectors. Built on this, we present a multisensory vision-language-action model architecture and train the model based on an RGB-pretrained VLA backbone. We evaluate OmniVLA on challenging real-world tasks where sensor-modality perception guides the robotic manipulation. OmniVLA achieves an average task success rate of 84%, significantly outperforms both RGB-only and raw-sensor-input baseline models by 59% and 28% respectively, meanwhile showing higher learning efficiency and stronger generalization capability.</p></details> |  |
| **[Unified Diffusion VLA: Vision-Language-Action Model via Joint Discrete Denoising Diffusion Process](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01718v1)** | 2025-11-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-language-action (VLA) models aim to understand natural language instructions and visual observations and to execute corresponding actions as an embodied agent. Recent work integrates future images into the understanding-acting loop, yielding unified VLAs that jointly understand, generate, and act -- reading text and images and producing future images and actions. However, these models either rely on external experts for modality unification or treat image generation and action prediction as separate processes, limiting the benefits of direct synergy between these tasks. Our core philosophy is to optimize generation and action jointly through a synchronous denoising process, where the iterative refinement enables actions to evolve from initialization, under constant and sufficient visual guidance. We ground this philosophy in our proposed Unified Diffusion VLA and Joint Discrete Denoising Diffusion Process (JD3P), which is a joint diffusion process that integrates multiple modalities into a single denoising trajectory to serve as the key mechanism enabling understanding, generation, and acting to be intrinsically synergistic. Our model and theory are built on a unified tokenized space of all modalities and a hybrid attention mechanism. We further propose a two-stage training pipeline and several inference-time techniques that optimize performance and efficiency. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on benchmarks such as CALVIN, LIBERO, and SimplerEnv with 4$\times$ faster inference than autoregressive methods, and we demonstrate its effectiveness through in-depth analysis and real-world evaluations.

| **[iFlyBot-VLA Technical Report](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01914v1)** | 2025-11-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce iFlyBot-VLA, a large-scale Vision-Language-Action (VLA) model trained under a novel framework. The main contributions are listed as follows: (1) a latent action model thoroughly trained on large-scale human and robotic manipulation videos; (2) a dual-level action representation framework that jointly supervises both the Vision-Language Model (VLM) and the action expert during training; (3) a mixed training strategy that combines robot trajectory data with general QA and spatial QA datasets, effectively enhancing the 3D perceptual and reasoning capabilities of the VLM backbone. Specifically, the VLM is trained to predict two complementary forms of actions: latent actions, derived from our latent action model pretrained on cross-embodiment manipulation data, which capture implicit high-level intentions; and structured discrete action tokens, obtained through frequency-domain transformations of continuous control signals, which encode explicit low-level dynamics. This dual supervision aligns the representation spaces of language, vision, and action, enabling the VLM to directly contribute to action generation. Experimental results on the LIBERO Franka benchmark demonstrate the superiority of our frame-work, while real-world evaluations further show that iFlyBot-VLA achieves competitive success rates across diverse and challenging manipulation tasks. Furthermore, we plan to open-source a portion of our self-constructed dataset to support future research in the community</p></details> |  |
| **[World-Env: Leveraging World Model as a Virtual Environment for VLA Post-Training](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24948v3)** | 2025-11-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models trained via imitation learning suffer from significant performance degradation in data-scarce scenarios due to their reliance on large-scale demonstration datasets. Although reinforcement learning (RL)-based post-training has proven effective in addressing data scarcity, its application to VLA models is hindered by the non-resettable nature of real-world environments. This limitation is particularly critical in high-risk domains such as industrial automation, where interactions often induce state changes that are costly or infeasible to revert. Furthermore, existing VLA approaches lack a reliable mechanism for detecting task completion, leading to redundant actions that reduce overall task success rates. To address these challenges, we propose World-Env, an RL-based post-training framework that replaces physical interaction with a low-cost, world model-based virtual simulator. World-Env consists of two key components: (1) a video-based world simulator that generates temporally consistent future visual observations, and (2) a vision-language model (VLM)-guided instant reflector that provides continuous reward signals and predicts action termination. This simulated environment enables VLA models to safely explore and generalize beyond their initial imitation learning distribution. Our method achieves notable performance gains with as few as five expert demonstrations per task. Experiments on complex robotic manipulation tasks demonstrate that World-Env effectively overcomes the data inefficiency, safety constraints, and inefficient execution of conventional VLA models that rely on real-world interaction, offering a practical and scalable solution for post-training in resource-constrained settings. Our code is available at https://github.com/amap-cvlab/world-env.</p></details> |  |

To achieve it, we introduce a bag of strategies to eliminate the overheads in model inference. The real-world experiment shows that the pi0 policy with our strategy achieves a 100% success rate in grasping a falling pen task.

Yet when these VLMs are adapted to the action modality, it remains unclear to what extent their original VL representations and knowledge are preserved. In this work, we conduct a systematic study of representation retention during VLA fine-tuning, showing that naive action fine-tuning leads to degradation of visual representations. To characterize and measure these effects, we probe VLA's hidden representations and analyze attention maps, further, we design a set of targeted tasks and methods that contrast VLA models with their counterpart VLMs, isolating changes in VL capabilities induced by action fine-tuning. We further evaluate a range of strategies for aligning visual representations and introduce a simple yet effective method that mitigates degradation and yields improved generalization to out-of-distribution (OOD) scenarios. Taken together, our analysis clarifies the trade-off between action fine-tuning and the degradation of VL representations and highlights practical approaches to recover inherited VL capabilities.

Yet, when trained via imitation learning, their high generative capacity makes them sensitive to noise in human demonstrations: jerks, pauses, and jitter which reduce action coherence. Reduced action coherence causes instability and trajectory drift during deployment, failures that are catastrophic in fine-grained manipulation where precision is crucial. In this paper, we present Action Coherence Guidance (ACG) for VLA models, a training-free test-time guidance algorithm that improves action coherence and thereby yields performance gains. Evaluated on RoboCasa, DexMimicGen, and real-world SO-101 tasks, ACG consistently improves action coherence and boosts success rates across diverse manipulation tasks.

| **[VLA-Cache: Efficient Vision-Language-Action Manipulation via Adaptive Token Caching](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02175v2)** | 2025-10-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have demonstrated strong multi-modal reasoning capabilities, enabling direct action generation from visual perception and language instructions in an end-to-end manner. However, their substantial computational cost poses a challenge for real-time robotic control, where rapid decision-making is essential. This paper introduces VLA-Cache, a training-free inference acceleration method that reduces computational overhead by adaptively caching and reusing static visual tokens across frames. Exploiting the temporal continuity in robotic manipulation, VLA-Cache identifies minimally changed tokens between adjacent frames and reuses their cached key-value representations, thereby circumventing redundant computations. Additionally, to maintain action precision, VLA-Cache selectively re-computes task-relevant tokens that are environmentally sensitive, ensuring the fidelity of critical visual information. To further optimize efficiency, we introduce a layer adaptive token reusing strategy that dynamically adjusts the reuse ratio based on attention concentration across decoder layers, prioritizing critical tokens for recomputation. Extensive experiments on two simulation platforms (LIBERO and SIMPLER) and a real-world robotic system demonstrate that VLA-Cache achieves up to 1.7x speedup in CUDA latency and a 15% increase in control frequency, with negligible loss on task success rate.

However, existing approaches often fail out-of-the-box when deployed in novel environments, embodiments, or tasks. We introduce Mixture of Skills VLA (MoS-VLA), a framework that represents robot manipulation policies as linear combinations of a finite set of learned basis functions. During pretraining, MoS-VLA jointly learns these basis functions across datasets from the Open X-Embodiment project, producing a structured skill space. At test time, adapting to a new task requires only a single expert demonstration. The corresponding skill representation is then inferred via a lightweight convex optimization problem that minimizes the L1 action error, without requiring gradient updates. This gradient-free adaptation incurs minimal overhead while enabling rapid instantiation of new skills. Empirically, MoS-VLA achieves lower action-prediction error on five out of five unseen datasets and succeeds in both simulation and real-robot tasks where a pretrained VLA model fails outright.

We introduce VDRive, a novel pipeline for end-to-end autonomous driving that explicitly models state-action mapping to address these challenges, enabling interpretable and robust decision making. By leveraging the advancement of the state understanding of the Vision Language Action Model (VLA) with generative diffusion policy-based action head, our VDRive guides the driving contextually and geometrically. Contextually, VLA predicts future observations through token generation pre-training, where the observations are represented as discrete codes by a Conditional Vector Quantized Variational Autoencoder (CVQ-VAE). Geometrically, we perform reinforcement learning fine-tuning of the VLA to predict future trajectories and actions based on current driving conditions. VLA supplies the current state tokens and predicted state tokens for the action policy head to generate hierarchical actions and trajectories. During policy training, a learned critic evaluates the actions generated by the policy and provides gradient-based feedback, forming an actor-critic framework that enables a reinforcement-based policy learning pipeline. Experiments show that our VDRive achieves state-of-the-art performance in the Bench2Drive closed-loop benchmark and nuScenes open-loop planning.</p></details> | 1st version |

By integrating action modules into these pretrained models, VLA methods exhibit improved generalization. However, training them from scratch is costly. In this work, we propose a simple yet effective distillation-based framework that equips VLMs with action-execution capability by transferring knowledge from pretrained small action models. Our architecture retains the original VLM structure, adding only an action token and a state encoder to incorporate physical inputs. To distill action knowledge, we adopt a two-stage training strategy. First, we perform lightweight alignment by mapping VLM hidden states into the action space of the small action model, enabling effective reuse of its pretrained action decoder and avoiding expensive pretraining. Second, we selectively fine-tune the language model, state encoder, and action modules, enabling the system to integrate multimodal inputs with precise action generation. Specifically, the action token provides the VLM with a direct handle for predicting future actions, while the state encoder allows the model to incorporate robot dynamics not captured by vision alone. This design yields substantial efficiency gains over training large VLA models from scratch. Compared with previous state-of-the-art methods, our method achieves 97.3% average success rate on LIBERO (11.8% improvement) and 93.5% on LIBERO-LONG (24.5% improvement). In real-world experiments across five manipulation tasks, our method consistently outperforms the teacher model, achieving 82.0% success rate (17% improvement), which demonstrate that action distillation effectively enables VLMs to generate precise actions while substantially reducing training costs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Homep...</summary><p>Homepage: https://ltbai.github.io/VITA-VLA/</p></details> |

However, their success rate drops significantly when faced with object concepts outside the training data, such as unseen object descriptions and textures in the dataset. To address this, we propose a novel agentic framework, VLA^2, which leverages OpenVLA as the execution backbone and effectively leverages external modules such as web retrieval and object detection to provide visual and textual knowledge about target objects to the VLA. This approach mitigates generalization failure when handling out-of-distribution objects. Based on the LIBERO simulation environment, we introduced novel objects and object descriptions to construct a new evaluation benchmark with three difficulty levels to test the effectiveness of our method. Our framework successfully outperformed the current state-of-the-art models on our designed hard-level generalization benchmark. Compared to the standalone OpenVLA baseline, VLA^2 achieves a 44.2% improvement in the success rate in the hard-level benchmark and an average improvement of 20.2% in all customized environments without any performance degradation on in-domain tasks.

However, the best way to build them remains an open question. Current approaches often add complexity, such as modifying the existing vocabulary of a Vision-Language Model (VLM) with action tokens or introducing special action heads. Curiously, the simplest strategy of representing actions directly as text has remained largely unexplored. This work introduces VLA-0 to investigate this idea. We find that VLA-0 is not only effective; it is surprisingly powerful. With the right design, VLA-0 outperforms more involved models. On LIBERO, a popular benchmark for evaluating VLAs, VLA-0 outperforms all existing methods trained on the same robotic data, including $π_0.5$-KI, OpenVLA-OFT and SmolVLA. Furthermore, without large-scale robotics-specific training, it outperforms methods trained on large-scale robotic data, like $π_0.5$-KI, $π_0$, GR00T-N1 and MolmoAct. These findings also translate to the real world, where VLA-0 outperforms SmolVLA, a VLA model pre-trained on large-scale real data. This paper summarizes our unexpected findings and spells out the specific techniques required to unlock the high performance of this simple yet potent VLA design.

| **[Reflection-Based Task Adaptation for Self-Improving VLA](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12710v1)** | 2025-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Pre-trained Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models represent a major leap towards general-purpose robots, yet efficiently adapting them to novel, specific tasks in-situ remains a significant hurdle. While reinforcement learning (RL) is a promising avenue for such adaptation, the process often suffers from low efficiency, hindering rapid task mastery. We introduce Reflective Self-Adaptation, a framework for rapid, autonomous task adaptation without human intervention. Our framework establishes a self-improving loop where the agent learns from its own experience to enhance both strategy and execution. The core of our framework is a dual-pathway architecture that addresses the full adaptation lifecycle. First, a Failure-Driven Reflective RL pathway enables rapid learning by using the VLM's causal reasoning to automatically synthesize a targeted, dense reward function from failure analysis. This provides a focused learning signal that significantly accelerates policy exploration. However, optimizing such proxy rewards introduces a potential risk of "reward hacking," where the agent masters the reward function but fails the actual task. To counteract this, our second pathway, Success-Driven Quality-Guided SFT, grounds the policy in holistic success. It identifies and selectively imitates high-quality successful trajectories, ensuring the agent remains aligned with the ultimate task goal. This pathway is strengthened by a conditional curriculum mechanism to aid initial exploration. We conduct experiments in challenging manipulation tasks. The results demonstrate that our framework achieves faster convergence and higher final success rates compared to representative baselines. Our work presents a robust solution for creating self-improving agents that can efficiently and reliably adapt to new environments.</p></details> |  |

Training VLA Models with Normalizing Flows](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16845v2)** | 2025-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have established a two-component architecture, where a pre-trained Vision-Language Model (VLM) encodes visual observations and task descriptions, and an action decoder maps these representations to continuous actions. Diffusion models have been widely adopted as action decoders due to their ability to model complex, multimodal action distributions. However, they require multiple iterative denoising steps at inference time or downstream techniques to speed up sampling, limiting their practicality in real-world settings where high-frequency control is crucial. In this work, we present NinA (Normalizing Flows in Action), a fast and expressive alternative to diffusion-based decoders for VLAs. NinA replaces the diffusion action decoder with a Normalizing Flow (NF) that enables one-shot sampling through an invertible transformation, significantly reducing inference time. We integrate NinA into the FLOWER VLA architecture and fine-tune on the LIBERO benchmark. Our experiments show that NinA matches the performance of its diffusion-based counterpart under the same training regime, while achieving substantially faster inference. These results suggest that NinA offers a promising path toward efficient, high-frequency VLA control without compromising performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>https...</summary><p>https://github.com/dunnolab/NinA/</p></details> |

To facilitate and leverage the heterogeneity in rich, diverse robotic data sources, we propose a novel Soft Prompt approach with minimally added parameters, by infusing prompt learning concepts into cross-embodiment robot learning and introducing separate sets of learnable embeddings for each distinct data source.

| **[Don't Run with Scissors: Pruning Breaks VLA Models but They Can Be Recovered](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08464v1)** | 2025-10-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have advanced robotic capabilities but remain challenging to deploy on resource-limited hardware. Pruning has enabled efficient compression of large language models (LLMs), yet it is largely understudied in robotics. Surprisingly, we observe that pruning VLA models leads to drastic degradation and increased safety violations. We introduce GLUESTICK, a post-pruning recovery method that restores much of the original model's functionality while retaining sparsity benefits. Our method performs a one-time interpolation between the dense and pruned models in weight-space to compute a corrective term. This correction is used during inference by each pruned layer to recover lost capabilities with minimal overhead. GLUESTICK requires no additional training, is agnostic to the pruning algorithm, and introduces a single hyperparameter that controls the tradeoff between efficiency and accuracy. Across diverse VLA architectures and tasks in manipulation and navigation, GLUESTICK achieves competitive memory efficiency while substantially recovering success rates and reducing safety violations.

Existing methods relying on text-only instructions often struggle to generalize to unseen scenarios. We argue that interleaved image-text inputs offer richer and less biased context and enable robots to better handle unseen tasks with more versatile human-robot interaction. Building on this insight, Interleave-VLA, the first robot learning paradigm capable of comprehending interleaved image-text instructions and directly generating continuous action sequences in the physical world, is introduced. It offers a natural, flexible, and model-agnostic paradigm that extends state-of-the-art vision-language-action (VLA) models with minimal modifications while achieving strong zero-shot generalization. Interleave-VLA also includes an automatic pipeline that converts text instructions from Open X-Embodiment into interleaved image-text instructions, resulting in a large-scale real-world interleaved embodied dataset with 210k episodes. Comprehensive evaluation in simulation and the real world shows that Interleave-VLA offers two major benefits: (1) improves out-of-domain generalization to unseen objects by 2x compared to text input baselines, (2) supports flexible task interfaces and diverse instructions in a zero-shot manner, such as hand-drawn sketches. We attribute Interleave-VLA's strong zero-shot capability to the use of instruction images, which effectively mitigate hallucinations, and the inclusion of heterogeneous multimodal datasets, enriched with Internet-sourced images, offering potential for scalability.

| **[TrackVLA++: Unleashing Reasoning and Memory Capabilities in VLA Models for Embodied Visual Tracking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07134v1)** | 2025-10-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Embodied Visual Tracking (EVT) is a fundamental ability that underpins practical applications, such as companion robots, guidance robots and service assistants, where continuously following moving targets is essential. Recent advances have enabled language-guided tracking in complex and unstructured scenes. However, existing approaches lack explicit spatial reasoning and effective temporal memory, causing failures under severe occlusions or in the presence of similar-looking distractors. To address these challenges, we present TrackVLA++, a novel Vision-Language-Action (VLA) model that enhances embodied visual tracking with two key modules, a spatial reasoning mechanism and a Target Identification Memory (TIM). The reasoning module introduces a Chain-of-Thought paradigm, termed Polar-CoT, which infers the target's relative position and encodes it as a compact polar-coordinate token for action prediction. Guided by these spatial priors, the TIM employs a gated update strategy to preserve long-horizon target memory, ensuring spatiotemporal consistency and mitigating target loss during extended occlusions. Extensive experiments show that TrackVLA++ achieves state-of-the-art performance on public benchmarks across both egocentric and multi-camera settings. On the challenging EVT-Bench DT split, TrackVLA++ surpasses the previous leading approach by 5.1 and 12, respectively. Furthermore, TrackVLA++ exhibits strong zero-shot generalization, enabling robust real-world tracking in dynamic and occluded scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://pku-epic.github.io/TrackVLA-plus-plus-Web/</p></details> |

However, their robustness to natural language variability in real-world scenarios has not been thoroughly investigated. In this work, we present a novel systematic study of the robustness of state-of-the-art VLA models under linguistic perturbations. Specifically, we evaluate model performance under two types of instruction noise: (1) human-generated paraphrasing and (2) the addition of irrelevant context. We further categorize irrelevant contexts into two groups according to their length and their semantic and lexical proximity to robot commands. In this study, we observe consistent performance degradation as context size expands. We also demonstrate that the model can exhibit relative robustness to random context, with a performance drop within 10%, while semantically and lexically similar context of the same length can trigger a quality decline of around 50%. Human paraphrases of instructions lead to a drop of nearly 20%. To mitigate this, we propose an LLM-based filtering framework that extracts core commands from noisy inputs. Incorporating our filtering step allows models to recover up to 98.5% of their original performance under noisy conditions.</p></details> |  |
| **[RLinf-VLA: A Unified and Efficient Framework for VLA+RL Training](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06710v1)** | 2025-10-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent progress in vision and language foundation models has significantly advanced multimodal understanding, reasoning, and generation, inspiring a surge of interest in extending such capabilities to embodied settings through vision-language-action (VLA) models. Yet, most VLA models are still trained with supervised fine-tuning (SFT), which struggles to generalize under distribution shifts due to error accumulation. Reinforcement learning (RL) offers a promising alternative by directly optimizing task performance through interaction, but existing attempts remain fragmented and lack a unified platform for fair and systematic comparison across model architectures and algorithmic designs. To address this gap, we introduce RLinf-VLA, a unified and efficient framework for scalable RL training of VLA models. The system adopts a highly flexible resource allocation design that addresses the challenge of integrating rendering, training, and inference in RL+VLA training. In particular, for GPU-parallelized simulators, RLinf-VLA implements a novel hybrid fine-grained pipeline allocation mode, achieving a 1.61x-1.88x speedup in training. Through a unified interface, RLinf-VLA seamlessly supports diverse VLA architectures (e.g., OpenVLA, OpenVLA-OFT), multiple RL algorithms (e.g., PPO, GRPO), and various simulators (e.g., ManiSkill, LIBERO). In simulation, a unified model achieves 98.11\% across 130 LIBERO tasks and 97.66\% across 25 ManiSkill tasks. Beyond empirical performance, our study distills a set of best practices for applying RL to VLA training and sheds light on emerging patterns in this integration. Furthermore, we present preliminary deployment on a real-world Franka robot, where RL-trained policies exhibit stronger generalization than those trained with SFT. We envision RLinf-VLA as a foundation to accelerate and standardize research on embodied intelligence.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This is the technical report of the RLinf Team, focusing on the algorithm side.

While Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models offer a promising solution by grounding natural language instructions into single-step control commands, they often lack mechanisms for lookahead and struggle with compounding errors in dynamic tasks. In this project, we introduce Scaling Inference-Time COMpute for VLAs (SITCOM), a framework that augments any pretrained VLA with model-based rollouts and reward-based trajectory selection, inspired by Model Predictive Control algorithm. SITCOM leverages a learned dynamics model to simulate multi-step action rollouts to select the best candidate plan for real-world execution, transforming one-shot VLAs into robust long-horizon planners. We develop an efficient transformer-based dynamics model trained on large-scale BridgeV2 data and fine-tuned on SIMPLER environments to bridge the Real2Sim gap, and score candidate rollouts using rewards from simulator. Through comprehensive evaluation across multiple tasks and settings in the SIMPLER environment, we demonstrate that SITCOM when combined with a good reward function can significantly improve task completion rate from 48% to 72% using trained dynamics model.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at the NeurIPS 2025 Workshop on Space in Vision, Language, and Embodied AI (SpaVLE). *Equal contribution</p></details> |

However, optical information of visual observations is difficult to be explicitly modeled like LiDAR point clouds or depth maps, which subsequently requires intelligent models and large-scale data. To this end, we propose to leverage the intelligence of the Vision-Language-Action (VLA) model to learn diverse navigation capabilities from synthetic expert data in a teacher-student manner. Specifically, we implement the VLA model, MM-Nav, as a multi-view VLA (with 360 observations) based on pretrained large language models and visual foundation models. For large-scale navigation data, we collect expert data from three reinforcement learning (RL) experts trained with privileged depth information in three challenging tailor-made environments for different navigation capabilities: reaching, squeezing, and avoiding. We iteratively train our VLA model using data collected online from RL experts, where the training ratio is dynamically balanced based on performance on individual capabilities. Through extensive experiments in synthetic environments, we demonstrate that our model achieves strong generalization capability. Moreover, we find that our student VLA model outperforms the RL teachers, demonstrating the synergistic effect of integrating multiple capabilities. Extensive real-world experiments further confirm the effectiveness of our method.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://pku-epic.github.io/MM-Nav-Web/</p></details> |
| **[SP-VLA: A Joint Model Scheduling and Token Pruning Approach for VLA Model Acceleration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12723v3)** | 2025-10-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have attracted increasing attention for their strong control capabilities. However, their high computational cost and low execution frequency hinder their suitability for real-time tasks such as robotic manipulation and autonomous navigation. Existing VLA acceleration methods primarily focus on structural optimization, overlooking the fact that these models operate in sequential decision-making environments. As a result, temporal redundancy in sequential action generation and spatial redundancy in visual input remain unaddressed. To this end, we propose SP-VLA, a unified framework that accelerates VLA models by jointly scheduling models and pruning tokens. Specifically, we design an action-aware model scheduling mechanism that reduces temporal redundancy by dynamically switching between VLA model and a lightweight generator. Inspired by the human motion pattern of focusing on key decision points while relying on intuition for other actions, we categorize VLA actions into deliberative and intuitive, assigning the former to the VLA model and the latter to the lightweight generator, enabling frequency-adaptive execution through collaborative model scheduling. To address spatial redundancy, we further develop a spatio-semantic dual-aware token pruning method. Tokens are classified into spatial and semantic types and pruned based on their dual-aware importance to accelerate VLA inference. These two mechanisms work jointly to guide the VLA in focusing on critical actions and salient visual information, achieving effective acceleration while maintaining high accuracy. Extensive experiments show that our method achieves 1.5$\times$ lossless acceleration in LIBERO and 2.4$\times$ in SimplerEnv, with up to 6% average performance gain. Inference frequency and latency improve by 2.2$\times$ in SimplerEnv and 1.4$\times$ in LIBERO.</p></details> |  |
| **[VLA-R1: Enhancing Reasoning in Vision-Language-Action Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01623v1)** | 2025-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models aim to unify perception, language understanding, and action generation, offering strong cross-task and cross-scene generalization with broad impact on embodied AI. However, current VLA models often lack explicit step-by-step reasoning, instead emitting final actions without considering affordance constraints or geometric relations. Their post-training pipelines also rarely reinforce reasoning quality, relying primarily on supervised fine-tuning with weak reward design. To address these challenges, we present VLA-R1, a reasoning-enhanced VLA that integrates Reinforcement Learning from Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to systematically optimize both reasoning and execution. Specifically, we design an RLVR-based post-training strategy with verifiable rewards for region alignment, trajectory consistency, and output formatting, thereby strengthening reasoning robustness and execution accuracy. Moreover, we develop VLA-CoT-13K, a high-quality dataset that provides chain-of-thought supervision explicitly aligned with affordance and trajectory annotations. Furthermore, extensive evaluations on in-domain, out-of-domain, simulation, and real-robot platforms demonstrate that VLA-R1 achieves superior generalization and real-world performance compared to prior VLA methods. We plan to release the model, code, and dataset following the publication of this work. Code: https://github.com/GigaAI-research/VLA-R1.

Reinforcement learning (RL) can mitigate these issues yet typically demands costly real-world interactions or suffers from sim-to-real gaps. We introduce VLA-RFT, a reinforcement fine-tuning framework that leverages a data-driven world model as a controllable simulator. Trained from real interaction data, the simulator predicts future visual observations conditioned on actions, allowing policy rollouts with dense, trajectory-level rewards derived from goal-achieving references. This design delivers an efficient and action-aligned learning signal, drastically lowering sample requirements. With fewer than 400 fine-tuning steps, VLA-RFT surpasses strong supervised baselines and achieves greater efficiency than simulator-based RL. Moreover, it exhibits strong robustness under perturbed conditions, sustaining stable task execution. Our results establish world-model-based RFT as a practical post-training paradigm to enhance the generalization and robustness of VLA models.

To tackle this challenge, recent Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models build policies on top of Vision-Language Models (VLMs), seeking to transfer their open-world semantic knowledge. However, their zero-shot capability lags significantly behind the base VLMs, as the instruction-vision-action data is too limited to cover diverse scenarios, tasks, and robot embodiments. In this work, we present Goal-VLA, a zero-shot framework that leverages Image-Generative VLMs as world models to generate desired goal states, from which the target object pose is derived to enable generalizable manipulation. The key insight is that object state representation is the golden interface, naturally separating a manipulation system into high-level and low-level policies. This representation abstracts away explicit action annotations, allowing the use of highly generalizable VLMs while simultaneously providing spatial cues for training-free low-level control. To further improve robustness, we introduce a Reflection-through-Synthesis process that iteratively validates and refines the generated goal image before execution. Both simulated and real-world experiments demonstrate that our \name achieves strong performance and inspiring generalizability in manipulation tasks.

An Empirical Study](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19789v3)** | 2025-09-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Vision-Language Action (VLA) models have shown significant potential for embodied AI. However, their predominant training via supervised fine-tuning (SFT) limits generalization due to susceptibility to compounding errors under distribution shifts. Reinforcement learning (RL) offers a path to overcome these limitations by optimizing for task objectives via trial-and-error, yet a systematic understanding of its specific generalization benefits for VLAs compared to SFT is lacking. To address this, our study introduces a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating VLA generalization and systematically investigates the impact of RL fine-tuning across diverse visual, semantic, and execution dimensions. Our extensive experiments reveal that RL fine-tuning, particularly with PPO, significantly enhances generalization in semantic understanding and execution robustness over SFT, while maintaining comparable visual robustness. We identify PPO as a more effective RL algorithm for VLAs than LLM-derived methods like DPO and GRPO. We also develop a simple recipe for efficient PPO training on VLAs, and demonstrate its practical utility for improving VLA generalization.

Yet, we identify two bottlenecks of LAMs: 1) the commonly adopted end-to-end trained image encoder suffers from poor spatial understanding; 2) LAMs can be fragile when input frames are distant, leading to limited temporal perception. Such factors inevitably hinder stable and clear action modeling. To this end, we propose Farsighted-LAM, a latent action framework with geometry-aware spatial encoding and multi-scale temporal modeling, capturing structural priors and dynamic motion patterns from consecutive frames. We further propose SSM-VLA, an end-to-end VLA framework built upon Farsighted-LAM, which integrates structured perception with a visual Chain-of-Thought module to explicitly reason about environmental dynamics, enhancing decision consistency and interpretability. We validate SSM-VLA on multiple VLA tasks in both simulation and real-world settings, and achieve state-of-the-art performance. Our results demonstrate that our strategy of combining geometry-aware modeling, temporal coherence, and explicit reasoning is effective in enhancing the robustness and generalizability of embodied intelligence.</p></details> |  |
| **[VLA Model Post-Training via Action-Chunked PPO and Self Behavior Cloning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25718v1)** | 2025-09-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement learning (RL) is a promising avenue for post-training vision-language-action (VLA) models, but practical deployment is hindered by sparse rewards and unstable training. This work mitigates these challenges by introducing an action chunk based on proximal policy optimization (PPO) with behavior cloning using self-collected demonstrations. Aggregating consecutive actions into chunks improves the temporal consistency of the policy and the density of informative feedback. In addition, an auxiliary behavior cloning loss is applied with a dynamically updated demonstration buffer that continually collects high-quality task trials during training. The relative weight between the action-chunked PPO objective and the self behavior clone auxiliary loss is adapted online to stabilize the post-training process. Experiments on the MetaWorld benchmark indicate improved performance over supervised fine-tuning, achieving a high success rate (0.93) and few steps to success (42.17). These results demonstrate the viability of RL for VLA post-training and help lay the groundwork for downstream VLA applications.</p></details> |  |

However, such models need to output actions at a rate suitable for robot control, which limits the size of the language model they can be based on, and consequently, their language understanding capabilities. Manipulation tasks may require complex language instructions, such as identifying target objects by their relative positions, to specify human intention. Therefore, we introduce IA-VLA, a framework that utilizes the extensive language understanding of a large vision language model as a pre-processing stage to generate improved context to augment the input of a VLA. We evaluate the framework on a set of semantically complex tasks which have been underexplored in VLA literature, namely tasks involving visual duplicates, i.e., visually indistinguishable objects. A dataset of three types of scenes with duplicate objects is used to compare a baseline VLA against two augmented variants. The experiments show that the VLA benefits from the augmentation scheme, especially when faced with language instructions that require the VLA to extrapolate from concepts it has seen in the demonstrations.

Reinforcement learning (RL) offers a potential alternative to generate demonstrations autonomously, yet conventional RL algorithms often struggle on long-horizon manipulation tasks with sparse rewards. In this paper, we propose a modified diffusion policy optimization algorithm to generate high-quality and low-variance trajectories, which contributes to a diffusion RL-powered VLA training pipeline. Our algorithm benefits from not only the high expressiveness of diffusion models to explore complex and diverse behaviors but also the implicit regularization of the iterative denoising process to yield smooth and consistent demonstrations. We evaluate our approach on the LIBERO benchmark, which includes 130 long-horizon manipulation tasks, and show that the generated trajectories are smoother and more consistent than both human demonstrations and those from standard Gaussian RL policies. Further, training a VLA model exclusively on the diffusion RL-generated data achieves an average success rate of 81.9%, which outperforms the model trained on human data by +5.3% and that on Gaussian RL-generated data by +12.6%. The results highlight our diffusion RL as an effective alternative for generating abundant, high-quality, and low-variance demonstrations for VLA models.</p></details> |  |
| **[MimicDreamer: Aligning Human and Robot Demonstrations for Scalable VLA Training](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22199v2)** | 2025-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision Language Action (VLA) models derive their generalization capability from diverse training data, yet collecting embodied robot interaction data remains prohibitively expensive. In contrast, human demonstration videos are far more scalable and cost-efficient to collect, and recent studies confirm their effectiveness in training VLA models. However, a significant domain gap persists between human videos and robot-executed videos, including unstable camera viewpoints, visual discrepancies between human hands and robotic arms, and differences in motion dynamics. To bridge this gap, we propose MimicDreamer, a framework that turns fast, low-cost human demonstrations into robot-usable supervision by jointly aligning vision, viewpoint, and actions to directly support policy training. For visual alignment, we propose H2R Aligner, a video diffusion model that generates high-fidelity robot demonstration videos by transferring motion from human manipulation footage. For viewpoint stabilization, EgoStabilizer is proposed, which canonicalizes egocentric videos via homography and inpaints occlusions and distortions caused by warping. For action alignment, we map human hand trajectories to the robot frame and apply a constrained inverse kinematics solver to produce feasible, low-jitter joint commands with accurate pose tracking. Empirically, VLA models trained purely on our synthesized human-to-robot videos achieve few-shot execution on real robots. Moreover, scaling training with human data significantly boosts performance compared to models trained solely on real robot data; our approach improves the average success rate by 14.7\% across six representative manipulation tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Leave No Observation Behind: Real-time Correction for VLA Action Chunks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23224v1)** | 2025-09-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>To improve efficiency and temporal coherence, Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models often predict action chunks; however, this action chunking harms reactivity under inference delay and long horizons. We introduce Asynchronous Action Chunk Correction (A2C2), which is a lightweight real-time chunk correction head that runs every control step and adds a time-aware correction to any off-the-shelf VLA's action chunk. The module combines the latest observation, the predicted action from VLA (base action), a positional feature that encodes the index of the base action within the chunk, and some features from the base policy, then outputs a per-step correction. This preserves the base model's competence while restoring closed-loop responsiveness. The approach requires no retraining of the base policy and is orthogonal to asynchronous execution schemes such as Real Time Chunking (RTC). On the dynamic Kinetix task suite (12 tasks) and LIBERO Spatial, our method yields consistent success rate improvements across increasing delays and execution horizons (+23% point and +7% point respectively, compared to RTC), and also improves robustness for long horizons even with zero injected delay. Since the correction head is small and fast, there is minimal overhead compared to the inference of large VLA models. These results indicate that A2C2 is an effective, plug-in mechanism for deploying high-capacity chunking policies in real-time control.</p></details> |  |

However, existing VLAs are limited to predicting short-sighted next-action, which struggle with long-horizon trajectory tasks due to incremental deviations. To address this problem, we propose a plug-in framework named VLA-Reasoner that effectively empowers off-the-shelf VLAs with the capability of foreseeing future states via test-time scaling. Specifically, VLA-Reasoner samples and rolls out possible action trajectories where involved actions are rationales to generate future states via a world model, which enables VLA-Reasoner to foresee and reason potential outcomes and search for the optimal actions. We further leverage Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) to improve search efficiency in large action spaces, where stepwise VLA predictions seed the root. Meanwhile, we introduce a confidence sampling mechanism based on Kernel Density Estimation (KDE), to enable efficient exploration in MCTS without redundant VLA queries. We evaluate intermediate states in MCTS via an offline reward shaping strategy, to score predicted futures and correct deviations with long-term feedback. We conducted extensive experiments in both simulators and the real world, demonstrating that our proposed VLA-Reasoner achieves significant improvements over the state-of-the-art VLAs. Our method highlights a potential pathway toward scalable test-time computation of robotic manipulation.</p></details> | 9 pages |
| **[Actions as Language: Fine-Tuning VLMs into VLAs Without Catastrophic Forgetting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22195v1)** | 2025-09-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Fine-tuning vision-language models (VLMs) on robot teleoperation data to create vision-language-action (VLA) models is a promising paradigm for training generalist policies, but it suffers from a fundamental tradeoff: learning to produce actions often diminishes the VLM's foundational reasoning and multimodal understanding, hindering generalization to novel scenarios, instruction following, and semantic understanding. We argue that this catastrophic forgetting is due to a distribution mismatch between the VLM's internet-scale pretraining corpus and the robotics fine-tuning data. Inspired by this observation, we introduce VLM2VLA: a VLA training paradigm that first resolves this mismatch at the data level by representing low-level actions with natural language. This alignment makes it possible to train VLAs solely with Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), thereby minimally modifying the VLM backbone and averting catastrophic forgetting. As a result, the VLM can be fine-tuned on robot teleoperation data without fundamentally altering the underlying architecture and without expensive co-training on internet-scale VLM datasets. Through extensive Visual Question Answering (VQA) studies and over 800 real-world robotics experiments, we demonstrate that VLM2VLA preserves the VLM's core capabilities, enabling zero-shot generalization to novel tasks that require open-world semantic reasoning and multilingual instruction following.</p></details> |  |

To address these limitations, we introduce DriveAction, the first action-driven benchmark specifically designed for VLA models, comprising 16,185 QA pairs generated from 2,610 driving scenarios. DriveAction leverages real-world driving data proactively collected by drivers of autonomous vehicles to ensure broad and representative scenario coverage, offers high-level discrete action labels collected directly from drivers' actual driving operations, and implements an action-rooted tree-structured evaluation framework that explicitly links vision, language, and action tasks, supporting both comprehensive and task-specific assessment. Our experiments demonstrate that state-of-the-art vision-language models (VLMs) require both vision and language guidance for accurate action prediction: on average, accuracy drops by 3.3% without vision input, by 4.1% without language input, and by 8.0% without either. Our evaluation supports precise identification of model bottlenecks with robust and consistent results, thus providing new insights and a rigorous foundation for advancing human-like decisions in autonomous driving.</p></details> | <details><summary>Bench...</summary><p>Benchmark: https://huggingface.co/datasets/LiAuto-DriveAction/drive-action</p></details> |
| **[Eva-VLA: Evaluating Vision-Language-Action Models' Robustness Under Real-World Physical Variations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18953v1)** | 2025-09-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have emerged as promising solutions for robotic manipulation, yet their robustness to real-world physical variations remains critically underexplored. To bridge this gap, we propose Eva-VLA, the first unified framework that systematically evaluates the robustness of VLA models by transforming discrete physical variations into continuous optimization problems. However, comprehensively assessing VLA robustness presents two key challenges: (1) how to systematically characterize diverse physical variations encountered in real-world deployments while maintaining evaluation reproducibility, and (2) how to discover worst-case scenarios without prohibitive real-world data collection costs efficiently. To address the first challenge, we decompose real-world variations into three critical domains: object 3D transformations that affect spatial reasoning, illumination variations that challenge visual perception, and adversarial patches that disrupt scene understanding. For the second challenge, we introduce a continuous black-box optimization framework that transforms discrete physical variations into parameter optimization, enabling systematic exploration of worst-case scenarios. Extensive experiments on state-of-the-art OpenVLA models across multiple benchmarks reveal alarming vulnerabilities: all variation types trigger failure rates exceeding 60%, with object transformations causing up to 97.8% failure in long-horizon tasks. Our findings expose critical gaps between controlled laboratory success and unpredictable deployment readiness, while the Eva-VLA framework provides a practical pathway for hardening VLA-based robotic manipulation models against real-world deployment challenges.</p></details> |  |
| **[Bi-VLA: Bilateral Control-Based Imitation Learning via Vision-Language Fusion for Action Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18865v1)** | 2025-09-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose Bilateral Control-Based Imitation Learning via Vision-Language Fusion for Action Generation (Bi-VLA), a novel framework that extends bilateral control-based imitation learning to handle more than one task within a single model. Conventional bilateral control methods exploit joint angle, velocity, torque, and vision for precise manipulation but require task-specific models, limiting their generality. Bi-VLA overcomes this limitation by utilizing robot joint angle, velocity, and torque data from leader-follower bilateral control with visual features and natural language instructions through SigLIP and FiLM-based fusion. We validated Bi-VLA on two task types: one requiring supplementary language cues and another distinguishable solely by vision. Real-robot experiments showed that Bi-VLA successfully interprets vision-language combinations and improves task success rates compared to conventional bilateral control-based imitation learning. Our Bi-VLA addresses the single-task limitation of prior bilateral approaches and provides empirical evidence that combining vision and language significantly enhances versatility. Experimental results validate the effectiveness of Bi-VLA in real-world tasks. For additional material, please visit the website: https://mertcookimg.github.io/bi-vla/</p></details> |  |

While this approach greatly enhances performance, it also incurs significant training costs. In this paper, we investigate how to effectively bridge vision-language (VL) representations to action (A). We introduce VLA-Adapter, a novel paradigm designed to reduce the reliance of VLA models on large-scale VLMs and extensive pre-training. To this end, we first systematically analyze the effectiveness of various VL conditions and present key findings on which conditions are essential for bridging perception and action spaces. Based on these insights, we propose a lightweight Policy module with Bridge Attention, which autonomously injects the optimal condition into the action space. In this way, our method achieves high performance using only a 0.5B-parameter backbone, without any robotic data pre-training. Extensive experiments on both simulated and real-world robotic benchmarks demonstrate that VLA-Adapter not only achieves state-of-the-art level performance, but also offers the fast inference speed reported to date. Furthermore, thanks to the proposed advanced bridging paradigm, VLA-Adapter enables the training of a powerful VLA model in just 8 hours on a single consumer-grade GPU, greatly lowering the barrier to deploying the VLA model.

However, VLMs' significant parameter size and autoregressive (AR) decoding nature impose considerable computational demands on VLA models. While Speculative Decoding (SD) has shown efficacy in accelerating Large Language Models (LLMs) by incorporating efficient drafting and parallel verification, allowing multiple tokens to be generated in one forward pass, its application to VLA models remains unexplored. This work introduces Spec-VLA, an SD framework designed to accelerate VLA models. Due to the difficulty of the action prediction task and the greedy decoding mechanism of the VLA models, the direct application of the advanced SD framework to the VLA prediction task yields a minor speed improvement. To boost the generation speed, we propose an effective mechanism to relax acceptance utilizing the relative distances represented by the action tokens of the VLA model. Empirical results across diverse test scenarios affirm the effectiveness of the Spec-VLA framework, and further analysis substantiates the impact of our proposed strategies, which enhance the acceptance length by 44%, achieving 1.42 times speedup compared with the OpenVLA baseline, without compromising the success rate. The success of the Spec-VLA framework highlights the potential for broader application of speculative execution in VLA prediction scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 5 figures, Accepted by EMNLP 2025 (main conference)</p></details> |

Existing text watermarking methods disrupt visual-textual alignment through biased token selection and static strategies, leaving semantic-critical concepts vulnerable. We propose VLA-Mark, a vision-aligned framework that embeds detectable watermarks while preserving semantic fidelity through cross-modal coordination. Our approach integrates multiscale visual-textual alignment metrics, combining localized patch affinity, global semantic coherence, and contextual attention patterns, to guide watermark injection without model retraining. An entropy-sensitive mechanism dynamically balances watermark strength and semantic preservation, prioritizing visual grounding during low-uncertainty generation phases. Experiments show 7.4% lower PPL and 26.6% higher BLEU than conventional methods, with near-perfect detection (98.8% AUC). The framework demonstrates 96.1\% attack resilience against attacks such as paraphrasing and synonym substitution, while maintaining text-visual consistency, establishing new standards for quality-preserving multimodal watermarking</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by the main conference, EMNLP 2025</p></details> |

However, they struggle with contact-rich tasks that require fine-grained control involving force, especially under visual occlusion or dynamic uncertainty. To address these limitations, we propose ForceVLA, a novel end-to-end manipulation framework that treats external force sensing as a first-class modality within VLA systems. ForceVLA introduces FVLMoE, a force-aware Mixture-of-Experts fusion module that dynamically integrates pretrained visual-language embeddings with real-time 6-axis force feedback during action decoding. This enables context-aware routing across modality-specific experts, enhancing the robot's ability to adapt to subtle contact dynamics. We also introduce \textbf{ForceVLA-Data}, a new dataset comprising synchronized vision, proprioception, and force-torque signals across five contact-rich manipulation tasks. ForceVLA improves average task success by 23.2% over strong pi_0-based baselines, achieving up to 80% success in tasks such as plug insertion. Our approach highlights the importance of multimodal integration for dexterous manipulation and sets a new benchmark for physically intelligent robotic control.

This ability to map multimodal inputs to actions is derived from the training of the VLA model on extensive standard demonstrations. These visual observations captured by third-personal global and in-wrist local cameras are inevitably varied in number and perspective across different environments, resulting in significant differences in the visual features. This perspective heterogeneity constrains the generality of VLA models. In light of this, we first propose the lightweight module VLA-LPAF to foster the perspective adaptivity of VLA models using only 2D data. VLA-LPAF is finetuned using images from a single view and fuses other multiview observations in the latent space, which effectively and efficiently bridge the gap caused by perspective inconsistency. We instantiate our VLA-LPAF framework with the VLA model RoboFlamingo to construct RoboFlamingo-LPAF. Experiments show that RoboFlamingo-LPAF averagely achieves around 8% task success rate improvement on CALVIN, 15% on LIBERO, and 30% on a customized simulation benchmark. We also demonstrate the developed viewadaptive characteristics of the proposed RoboFlamingo-LPAF through real-world tasks.</p></details> |  |

While supervised fine-tuning with demonstrations is constrained by data quality, reinforcement learning (RL) offers a promising alternative. We propose a human-in-the-loop dual-actor fine-tuning framework grounded in RL. The framework integrates a primary actor for robust multi-task performance with a refinement actor for latent-space adaptation. Beyond standard physical interventions, we introduce a lightweight talk-and-tweak scheme that converts human corrections into semantically grounded language commands, thereby generating a new dataset for policy learning. In real-world multi-task experiments, our approach achieves 100% success across three tasks within 101 minutes of online fine-tuning. For long-horizon tasks, it sustains a 50% success rate over 12 consecutive operations. Furthermore, the framework scales effectively to multi-robot training, achieving up to a 2 times improvement in efficiency when using dual robots.

Visual Language Action (VLA) models, pretrained on large-scale web datasets, have shown promise in decision-making tasks. However, previous work has primarily focused on action post-training, often neglecting enhancements to the foundational model itself. In response, we introduce a novel approach, Act from Visual Language Post-Training, which refines Visual Language Models (VLMs) through visual and linguistic guidance in a self-supervised manner. This enhancement improves the models' capabilities in world knowledge, visual recognition, and spatial grounding in open-world environments. Following the above post-training paradigms, we obtain the first VLA models in Minecraft that can follow human instructions on over 1k different atomic tasks, including crafting, smelting, cooking, mining, and killing. Our experiments demonstrate that post-training on non-trajectory tasks leads to a significant 40% improvement over the best agent baseline on a diverse set of atomic tasks. Furthermore, we demonstrate that our approach surpasses traditional imitation learning-based policies in Minecraft, achieving state-of-the-art performance. We have open-sourced the code, models, and datasets to foster further research. The project page can be found in https://craftjarvis.github.io/JarvisVLA.</p></details> | Accepted by ACL 2025 |

Despite substantial progress enabled by large-scale pretraining and supervised fine-tuning (SFT), these models face two fundamental challenges: (i) the scarcity and high cost of large-scale human-operated robotic trajectories required for SFT scaling, and (ii) limited generalization to tasks involving distribution shift. Recent breakthroughs in Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) demonstrate that reinforcement learning (RL) can dramatically enhance step-by-step reasoning capabilities, raising a natural question: Can RL similarly improve the long-horizon step-by-step action planning of VLA? In this work, we introduce SimpleVLA-RL, an efficient RL framework tailored for VLA models. Building upon veRL, we introduce VLA-specific trajectory sampling, scalable parallelization, multi-environment rendering, and optimized loss computation. When applied to OpenVLA-OFT, SimpleVLA-RL achieves SoTA performance on LIBERO and even outperforms $π_0$ on RoboTwin 1.0\&2.0 with the exploration-enhancing strategies we introduce. SimpleVLA-RL not only reduces dependence on large-scale data and enables robust generalization, but also remarkably surpasses SFT in real-world tasks. Moreover, we identify a novel phenomenon ``pushcut'' during RL training, wherein the policy discovers previously unseen patterns beyond those seen in the previous training process.

However, their extensive computational and memory costs hinder their practical deployment. Existing VLA compression and acceleration approaches conduct quantization or token pruning in an ad-hoc manner but fail to enable both for a holistic efficiency improvement due to an observed incompatibility. This work introduces SQAP-VLA, the first structured, training-free VLA inference acceleration framework that simultaneously enables state-of-the-art quantization and token pruning. We overcome the incompatibility by co-designing the quantization and token pruning pipeline, where we propose new quantization-aware token pruning criteria that work on an aggressively quantized model while improving the quantizer design to enhance pruning effectiveness. When applied to standard VLA models, SQAP-VLA yields significant gains in computational efficiency and inference speed while successfully preserving core model performance, achieving a $\times$1.93 speedup and up to a 4.5\% average success rate enhancement compared to the original model.</p></details> | 12 pages, 9 figures |

Recently, masked diffusion models, a paradigm distinct from autoregressive models, have begun to demonstrate competitive performance in text generation and multimodal applications, leading to the development of a series of diffusion-based VLMs (d-VLMs). However, leveraging such models for robot policy learning remains largely unexplored. In this work, we present LLaDA-VLA, the first Vision-Language-Diffusion-Action model built upon pretrained d-VLMs for robotic manipulation. To effectively adapt d-VLMs to robotic domain, we introduce two key designs: (1) a localized special-token classification strategy that replaces full-vocabulary classification with special action token classification, reducing adaptation difficulty; (2) a hierarchical action-structured decoding strategy that decodes action sequences hierarchically considering the dependencies within and across actions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that LLaDA-VLA significantly outperforms state-of-the-art VLAs on both simulation and real-world robots.</p></details> |  |

However, current Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models lack the ability to integrate such subtle physical feedback. In this work, we explore Torque-aware VLA models, aiming to bridge this gap by systematically studying the design space for incorporating torque signals into existing VLA architectures. We identify and evaluate several strategies, leading to three key findings. First, introducing torque adapters into the decoder consistently outperforms inserting them into the encoder.Third, inspired by joint prediction and planning paradigms in autonomous driving, we propose predicting torque as an auxiliary output, which further improves performance. This strategy encourages the model to build a physically grounded internal representation of interaction dynamics. Extensive quantitative and qualitative experiments across contact-rich manipulation benchmarks validate our findings.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to CoRL 2025, project page: \url{https://zzongzheng0918.github.io/Torque-Aware-VLA.github.io/}</p></details> |

Recently applied to Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models, existing methods prune tokens using only local info from current action, ignoring global context from prior actions, causing >20% success rate drop and limited speedup. We observe high similarity across consecutive actions and propose leveraging both local (current) and global (past) info for smarter token selection. We introduce SpecPrune-VLA, a training-free method with two-level pruning and heuristic control: (1) Static pruning at action level: uses global history and local context to reduce visual tokens per action; (2) Dynamic pruning at layer level: prunes tokens per layer based on layer-specific importance; (3) Lightweight action-aware controller: classifies actions as coarse/fine-grained (by speed), adjusting pruning aggressiveness since fine-grained actions are pruning-sensitive. Experiments on LIBERO show SpecPrune-VLA achieves 1.46 times speedup on NVIDIA A800 and 1.57 times on NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3090 vs. OpenVLA-OFT, with negligible success rate loss.</p></details> | 8pages, 10 figures, |

However, the action accuracy of these models on complex downstream tasks is unsatisfactory. One important reason is that these models rely solely on the post-training paradigm of imitation learning, which makes it difficult to have a deeper understanding of the distribution properties of data quality, which is exactly what Reinforcement Learning (RL) excels at. In this paper, we theoretically propose an offline RL post-training objective for VLA flow models and induce an efficient and feasible offline RL fine-tuning algorithm -- Adaptive Reinforced Flow Matching (ARFM). By introducing an adaptively adjusted scaling factor in the VLA flow model loss, we construct a principled bias-variance trade-off objective function to optimally control the impact of RL signal on flow loss. ARFM adaptively balances RL advantage preservation and flow loss gradient variance control, resulting in a more stable and efficient fine-tuning process. Extensive simulation and real-world experimental results show that ARFM exhibits excellent generalization, robustness, few-shot learning, and continuous learning performance.</p></details> |  |

A comprehensive benchmark spanning tabletop manipulation, few-shot learning, and long-horizon mobile manipulation, demonstrates the effectiveness of our approach.

Our approach features a novel phase-aware input masking strategy that adaptively segments each subtask into moving and interaction phases, enabling the model to focus on phase-relevant sensory cues and enhancing subtask compatibility. This unified strategy preserves the scalability and data efficiency of VLA training, and our architecture-agnostic module can be seamlessly integrated into existing VLA models.

However, existing VLA models exhibit notable limitations in handling ambiguous language instructions and unknown environmental states. Furthermore, their perception is largely constrained to static two-dimensional observations, lacking the capability to model three-dimensional interactions between the robot and its environment. To address these challenges, this paper proposes GraphCoT-VLA, an efficient end-to-end model. To enhance the model's ability to interpret ambiguous instructions and improve task planning, we design a structured Chain-of-Thought reasoning module that integrates high-level task understanding and planning, failed task feedback, and low-level imaginative reasoning about future object positions and robot actions. Additionally, we construct a real-time updatable 3D Pose-Object graph, which captures the spatial configuration of robot joints and the topological relationships between objects in 3D space, enabling the model to better understand and manipulate their interactions. We further integrates a dropout hybrid reasoning strategy to achieve efficient control outputs. Experimental results across multiple real-world robotic tasks demonstrate that GraphCoT-VLA significantly outperforms existing methods in terms of task success rate and response speed, exhibiting strong generalization and robustness in open environments and under uncertain instructions.</p></details> | 10 pages, 6 figures |

However, two critical challenges hinder their development: (1) Existing VLA architectures are typically based on imitation learning in open-loop setup which tends to capture the recorded behaviors in the dataset, leading to suboptimal and constrained performance, (2) Close-loop training relies heavily on high-fidelity sensor simulation, where domain gaps and computational inefficiencies pose significant barriers. In this paper, we introduce IRL-VLA, a novel close-loop Reinforcement Learning via \textbf{I}nverse \textbf{R}einforcement \textbf{L}earning reward world model with a self-built VLA approach. Our framework proceeds in a three-stage paradigm: In the first stage, we propose a VLA architecture and pretrain the VLA policy via imitation learning. In the second stage, we construct a lightweight reward world model via inverse reinforcement learning to enable efficient close-loop reward computation. To further enhance planning performance, finally, we design specialized reward world model guidence reinforcement learning via PPO(Proximal Policy Optimization) to effectively balance the safety incidents, comfortable driving, and traffic efficiency.

Although recent research has focused on enhancing spatial and temporal understanding independently, this paper presents a novel approach that integrates both aspects through visual prompting. We introduce a method that projects visual traces of key points from observations onto depth maps, enabling models to capture both spatial and temporal information simultaneously. The experiments in SimplerEnv show that the mean number of tasks successfully solved increased for 4% compared to SpatialVLA and 19% compared to TraceVLA.

However, their success rates are often not on par with expert policies, and they require fine-tuning when the setup changes. In this work, we introduce Refined Policy Distillation (RPD), a novel Reinforcement Learning (RL)-based policy refinement method that bridges this performance gap through a combination of on-policy RL with behavioral cloning. The core idea of RPD is to distill and refine VLAs into compact, high-performing expert policies by guiding the student policy during RL exploration using the actions of a teacher VLA, resulting in increased sample efficiency and faster convergence. We complement our method by fine-tuned versions of Octo and OpenVLA for ManiSkill3 to evaluate RPD in simulation. While this is a key requirement for applying RL, it also yields new insights beyond existing studies on VLA performance in real-world settings. Our experimental results across various manipulation tasks show that RPD enables the RL student to learn expert policies that outperform the VLA teacher in both dense and sparse reward settings, while also achieving faster convergence than the RL baseline. Our approach is even robust to changes in camera perspective and can generalize to task variations that the underlying VLA cannot solve.

OpenAI's recent model, O1, showcased impressive capabilities in solving complex problems by utilizing extensive reasoning chains. This prompts an important question: can robot models achieve better performance in multi-task , complex environments by reviewing prior observations and then providing task-specific reasoning to guide action prediction? In this paper, we introduce Chain-of-Affordance (CoA-VLA) , a novel approach to scaling robot models by incorporating reasoning in the format of sequential robot affordances to facilitate task completion. Specifically, we prompt the model to consider the following four types of affordances before taking action: (1) object affordance - what object to manipulate and where it is ; (2) grasp affordance - the specific object part to grasp ; (3) spatial affordance - the optimal space to place the object ; and (4) movement affordance-the collision - free path for movement. We further transform each affordance into two prompting formats: visual affordance and textual affordance. We introduce a novel vision-language co-injection module that integrates this knowledge into the policy network. This allows the robot to leverage essential contextual information during action inference, resulting in improved precision and robustness. Our experiments demonstrate that CoA-VLA outperforms state-of-the-art robot foundation models, including OpenVLA and Octo, on a variety of tasks.

We present VLA-Touch, an approach that enhances generalist robot policies with tactile sensing \emph{without fine-tuning} the base VLA. Our method introduces two key innovations: (1) a pipeline that leverages a pretrained tactile-language model that provides semantic tactile feedback for high-level task planning, and (2) a diffusion-based controller that refines VLA-generated actions with tactile signals for contact-rich manipulation. Through real-world experiments, we demonstrate that our dual-level integration of tactile feedback improves task planning efficiency while enhancing execution precision.

| **[Tactile-VLA: Unlocking Vision-Language-Action Model's Physical Knowledge for Tactile Generalization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09160v1)** | 2025-07-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have shown remarkable achievements, driven by the rich implicit knowledge of their vision-language components. However, achieving generalist robotic agents demands precise grounding into physical interactions, especially in contact-rich scenarios where fine-grained force control is essential. We advance VLAs' implicit knowledge beyond identifying what to do, towards guiding how to physically interact with real world. This paper introduces Tactile-VLA, a novel framework that deeply fuses vision, language, action, and tactile sensing. This framework incorporates a hybrid position-force controller to translate the model's intentions into precise physical actions and a reasoning module that allows the robot to adapt its strategy based on tactile feedback. Experiments demonstrate Tactile-VLA's effectiveness and generalizability in three key aspects: (1) enabling tactile-aware instruction following, (2) utilizing tactile-relevant commonsense, and (3) facilitating adaptive tactile-involved reasoning. A key finding is that the VLM's prior knowledge already contains semantic understanding of physical interaction; by connecting it to the robot's tactile sensors with only a few demonstrations, we can activate this prior knowledge to achieve zero-shot generalization in contact-rich tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[UP-VLA: A Unified Understanding and Prediction Model for Embodied Agent](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18867v3)** | 2025-06-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have leveraged pre-trained Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to improve the generalization capabilities. VLMs, typically pre-trained on vision-language understanding tasks, provide rich semantic knowledge and reasoning abilities. However, prior research has shown that VLMs often focus on high-level semantic content and neglect low-level features, limiting their ability to capture detailed spatial information and understand physical dynamics. These aspects, which are crucial for embodied control tasks, remain underexplored in existing pre-training paradigms. In this paper, we investigate the training paradigm for VLAs, and introduce \textbf{UP-VLA}, a \textbf{U}nified VLA model training with both multi-modal \textbf{U}nderstanding and future \textbf{P}rediction objectives, enhancing both high-level semantic comprehension and low-level spatial understanding. Experimental results show that UP-VLA achieves a 33% improvement on the Calvin ABC-D benchmark compared to the previous state-of-the-art method. Additionally, UP-VLA demonstrates improved success rates in real-world manipulation tasks, particularly those requiring precise spatial information.</p></details> | Accepted to ICML2025 |

Leveraging strengths of VLM in vision perception and instruction understanding, VLA models exhibit promising generalization across diverse manipulation tasks. However, applications demanding high precision and accuracy reveal performance gaps without further adaptation. Evidence from multiple domains highlights the critical role of post-training to align foundational models with downstream applications, spurring extensive research on post-training VLA models. VLA model post-training aims to address the challenge of improving an embodiment's ability to interact with the environment for the given tasks, analogous to the process of humans motor skills acquisition. Accordingly, this paper reviews post-training strategies for VLA models through the lens of human motor learning, focusing on three dimensions: environments, embodiments, and tasks. A structured taxonomy is introduced aligned with human learning mechanisms: (1) enhancing environmental perception, (2) improving embodiment awareness, (3) deepening task comprehension, and (4) multi-component integration. Finally, key challenges and trends in post-training VLA models are identified, establishing a conceptual framework to guide future research. This work delivers both a comprehensive overview of current VLA model post-training methods from a human motor learning perspective and practical insights for VLA model development.

However, existing approaches vary significantly in terms of network architectures, planning paradigms, representations, and training data sources, making it challenging for researchers to identify the precise sources of performance gains and components to be further improved. To systematically investigate the impacts of different planning paradigms and representations isolating from network architectures and training data, in this paper, we introduce VLA-OS, a unified VLA architecture series capable of various task planning paradigms, and design a comprehensive suite of controlled experiments across diverse object categories (rigid and deformable), visual modalities (2D and 3D), environments (simulation and real-world), and end-effectors (grippers and dexterous hands). Our results demonstrate that: 1) visually grounded planning representations are generally better than language planning representations; 2) the Hierarchical-VLA paradigm generally achieves superior or comparable performance than other paradigms on task performance, pretraining, generalization ability, scalability, and continual learning ability, albeit at the cost of slower training and inference speeds.</p></details> |  |
| **[CEED-VLA: Consistency Vision-Language-Action Model with Early-Exit Decoding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13725v1)** | 2025-06-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have become a vital research direction in robotics due to their impressive multimodal understanding and generalization capabilities. Despite the progress, their practical deployment is severely constrained by inference speed bottlenecks, particularly in high-frequency and dexterous manipulation tasks. While recent studies have explored Jacobi decoding as a more efficient alternative to traditional autoregressive decoding, its practical benefits are marginal due to the lengthy iterations. To address it, we introduce consistency distillation training to predict multiple correct action tokens in each iteration, thereby achieving acceleration. Besides, we design mixed-label supervision to mitigate the error accumulation during distillation. Although distillation brings acceptable speedup, we identify that certain inefficient iterations remain a critical bottleneck. To tackle this, we propose an early-exit decoding strategy that moderately relaxes convergence conditions, which further improves average inference efficiency. Experimental results show that the proposed method achieves more than 4 times inference acceleration across different baselines while maintaining high task success rates in both simulated and real-world robot tasks. These experiments validate that our approach provides an efficient and general paradigm for accelerating multimodal decision-making in robotics.

To address this, we introduce Impromptu VLA. Our core contribution is the Impromptu VLA Dataset: over 80,000 meticulously curated video clips, distilled from over 2M source clips sourced from 8 open-source large-scale datasets. This dataset is built upon our novel taxonomy of four challenging unstructured categories and features rich, planning-oriented question-answering annotations and action trajectories. Crucially, experiments demonstrate that VLAs trained with our dataset achieve substantial performance gains on established benchmarks--improving closed-loop NeuroNCAP scores and collision rates, and reaching near state-of-the-art L2 accuracy in open-loop nuScenes trajectory prediction. Furthermore, our Q&A suite serves as an effective diagnostic, revealing clear VLM improvements in perception, prediction, and planning.

However, exploiting offline data with limited visited states will cause execution failure in out-of-distribution scenarios. Intuitively, an exploration-based method that improves on online collected data at test time could address this limitation. We present VLA-RL, an algorithmic and systematic framework that leverages online reinforcement learning (RL) to improve pretrained auto-regressive VLAs in downstream tasks. Within a unified perspective, we first introduce a trajectory-level RL formulation for auto-regressive VLA training, which models general robotic manipulation trajectory as multi-modal multi-turn conversation. To address the challenge of sparse rewards, we fine-tune a pretrained vision-language model as a robotic process reward model, which is trained on pseudo reward labels annotated on automatically extracted task segments. To scale up, we identify several implementation findings that improve the stability and efficiency including curriculum selection strategy, GPU-balanced vectorized environments, batch decoding, and critic warmup. VLA-RL enables OpenVLA-7B to surpass the strongest finetuned baseline by 4.5% on 40 challenging robotic manipulation tasks in LIBERO, and even matches the performance of advanced commercial models such as $π_0$-FAST. Notably, we observe that VLA-RL benefits from increased test-time optimization, indicating an early spark of inference scaling laws in robotics.</p></details> |  |

This system leverages the rich contextual information provided by satellite images, allowing for enhanced decision-making and mission planning. The combination of visual analysis by VLM and natural language processing by GPT can provide the user with the path-and-action set, making aerial operations more efficient and accessible.

| **[MoLe-VLA: Dynamic Layer-skipping Vision Language Action Model via Mixture-of-Layers for Efficient Robot Manipulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20384v2)** | 2025-04-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) excel in understanding complex language and visual data, enabling generalist robotic systems to interpret instructions and perform embodied tasks. Nevertheless, their real-world deployment is hindered by substantial computational and storage demands. Recent insights into the homogeneous patterns in the LLM layer have inspired sparsification techniques to address these challenges, such as early exit and token pruning. However, these methods often neglect the critical role of the final layers that encode the semantic information most relevant to downstream robotic tasks. Aligning with the recent breakthrough of the Shallow Brain Hypothesis (SBH) in neuroscience and the mixture of experts in model sparsification, we conceptualize each LLM layer as an expert and propose a Mixture-of-Layers Vision-Language-Action model (MoLe-VLA, or simply MoLe) architecture for dynamic LLM layer activation. We introduce a Spatial-Temporal Aware Router (STAR) for MoLe to selectively activate only parts of the layers based on the robot's current state, mimicking the brain's distinct signal pathways specialized for cognition and causal reasoning. Additionally, to compensate for the cognitive ability of LLMs lost in MoLe, we devise a Cognition Self-Knowledge Distillation (CogKD) framework. CogKD enhances the understanding of task demands and improves the generation of task-relevant action sequences by leveraging cognitive features. Extensive experiments conducted in both RLBench simulation and real-world environments demonstrate the superiority of MoLe-VLA in both efficiency and performance. Specifically, MoLe-VLA achieves an 8% improvement in the mean success rate across ten tasks while reducing computational costs by up to x5.6 compared to standard LLMs.</p></details> |  |

However, fine-tuning these models through supervised learning struggles to achieve robust performance due to limited, inconsistent demonstrations, especially in contact-rich environments. In this paper, we propose a reinforced fine-tuning approach for VLA models, named ConRFT, which consists of offline and online fine-tuning with a unified consistency-based training objective, to address these challenges. In the offline stage, our method integrates behavior cloning and Q-learning to effectively extract policy from a small set of demonstrations and stabilize value estimating. In the online stage, the VLA model is further fine-tuned via consistency policy, with human interventions to ensure safe exploration and high sample efficiency. We evaluate our approach on eight diverse real-world manipulation tasks. It achieves an average success rate of 96.3% within 45-90 minutes of online fine-tuning, outperforming prior supervised methods with a 144% improvement in success rate and 1.9x shorter episode length. This work highlights the potential of integrating reinforcement learning to enhance the performance of VLA models for real-world robotic applications.

While this paradigm effectively utilizes large-scale data from both robotic and non-robotic sources, current VLAs primarily focus on direct input--output mappings, lacking the intermediate reasoning steps crucial for complex manipulation tasks. As a result, existing VLAs lack temporal planning or reasoning capabilities. In this paper, we introduce a method that incorporates explicit visual chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning into vision-language-action models (VLAs) by predicting future image frames autoregressively as visual goals before generating a short action sequence to achieve these goals. We introduce CoT-VLA, a state-of-the-art 7B VLA that can understand and generate visual and action tokens. Our experimental results demonstrate that CoT-VLA achieves strong performance, outperforming the state-of-the-art VLA model by 17% in real-world manipulation tasks and 6% in simulation benchmarks.

One such application is indoor navigation using natural language instructions. However, despite recent progress, this problem remains challenging due to the 3D spatial reasoning and semantic understanding required. Additionally, the language used may be imperfect or misaligned with the scene, further complicating the task. To address this challenge, we curate a benchmark dataset, IRef-VLA, for Interactive Referential Vision and Language-guided Action in 3D Scenes with imperfect references. IRef-VLA is the largest real-world dataset for the referential grounding task, consisting of over 11.5K scanned 3D rooms from existing datasets, 7.6M heuristically generated semantic relations, and 4.7M referential statements. Our dataset also contains semantic object and room annotations, scene graphs, navigable free space annotations, and is augmented with statements where the language has imperfections or ambiguities. We verify the generalizability of our dataset by evaluating with state-of-the-art models to obtain a performance baseline and also develop a graph-search baseline to demonstrate the performance bound and generation of alternatives using scene-graph knowledge. With this benchmark, we aim to provide a resource for 3D scene understanding that aids the development of robust, interactive navigation systems.

The widespread adoption of instruction-tuned image-to-text vision-language assistants (VLAs) like LLaVA and InternVL necessitates evaluating gender biases. We study gender bias in 22 popular open-source VLAs with respect to personality traits, skills, and occupations. Our results show that VLAs replicate human biases likely present in the data, such as real-world occupational imbalances. Similarly, they tend to attribute more skills and positive personality traits to women than to men, and we see a consistent tendency to associate negative personality traits with men. To eliminate the gender bias in these models, we find that fine-tuning-based debiasing methods achieve the best trade-off between debiasing and retaining performance on downstream tasks. We argue for pre-deploying gender bias assessment in VLAs and motivate further development of debiasing strategies to ensure equitable societal outcomes.

Although these models have achieved significant improvements, their generalization in multi-task manipulation remains limited. This study proposes a VLA model-expert collaboration framework that leverages a limited number of expert actions to enhance VLA model performance. This approach reduces expert workload relative to manual operation while simultaneously improving the reliability and generalization of VLA models. Furthermore, manipulation data collected during collaboration can further refine the VLA model, while human participants concurrently enhance their skills. This bi-directional learning loop boosts the overall performance of the collaboration system. Experimental results across various VLA models demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed system in collaborative manipulation and learning, as evidenced by improved success rates across tasks. Additionally, validation using a brain-computer interface (BCI) indicates that the collaboration system enhances the efficiency of low-speed action systems by involving VLA model during manipulation. These promising results pave the way for advancing human-robot interaction in the era of foundation models for robotics. (Project website: https://aoqunjin.github.io/Expert-VLA/)</p></details> |  |

This research explores the integration of advanced algorithms that enable drones to adapt their navigation strategies based on real-time environmental feedback, mimicking the decision-making processes of human pilots. The model, fine-tuned on a collected racing drone dataset, demonstrates strong generalization despite the complexity of drone racing environments. RaceVLA outperforms OpenVLA in motion (75.0 vs 60.0) and semantic generalization (45.5 vs 36.3), benefiting from the dynamic camera and simplified motion tasks. However, visual (79.6 vs 87.0) and physical (50.0 vs 76.7) generalization were slightly reduced due to the challenges of maneuvering in dynamic environments with varying object sizes. RaceVLA also outperforms RT-2 across all axes - visual (79.6 vs 52.0), motion (75.0 vs 55.0), physical (50.0 vs 26.7), and semantic (45.5 vs 38.8), demonstrating its robustness for real-time adjustments in complex environments. Experiments revealed an average velocity of 1.04 m/s, with a maximum speed of 2.02 m/s, and consistent maneuverability, demonstrating RaceVLA's ability to handle high-speed scenarios effectively.

We propose Humanoid-VLA, a novel framework that integrates language understanding, egocentric scene perception, and motion control, enabling universal humanoid control. Humanoid-VLA begins with language-motion pre-alignment using non-egocentric human motion datasets paired with textual descriptions, allowing the model to learn universal motion patterns and action semantics. We then incorporate egocentric visual context through a parameter efficient video-conditioned fine-tuning, enabling context-aware motion generation. Furthermore, we introduce a self-supervised data augmentation strategy that automatically generates pseudoannotations directly derived from motion data. This process converts raw motion sequences into informative question-answer pairs, facilitating the effective use of large-scale unlabeled video data. Built upon whole-body control architectures, extensive experiments show that Humanoid-VLA achieves object interaction and environment exploration tasks with enhanced contextual awareness, demonstrating a more human-like capacity for adaptive and intelligent engagement.</p></details> |  |
| **[VLAS: Vision-Language-Action Model With Speech Instructions For Customized Robot Manipulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13508v2)** | 2025-02-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-language-action models (VLAs) have become increasingly popular in robot manipulation for their end-to-end design and remarkable performance. However, existing VLAs rely heavily on vision-language models (VLMs) that only support text-based instructions, neglecting the more natural speech modality for human-robot interaction. Traditional speech integration methods usually involves a separate speech recognition system, which complicates the model and introduces error propagation. Moreover, the transcription procedure would lose non-semantic information in the raw speech, such as voiceprint, which may be crucial for robots to successfully complete customized tasks. To overcome above challenges, we propose VLAS, a novel end-to-end VLA that integrates speech recognition directly into the robot policy model. VLAS allows the robot to understand spoken commands through inner speech-text alignment and produces corresponding actions to fulfill the task. We also present two new datasets, SQA and CSI, to support a three-stage tuning process for speech instructions, which empowers VLAS with the ability of multimodal interaction across text, image, speech, and robot actions. Taking a step further, a voice retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) paradigm is designed to enable our model to effectively handle tasks that require individual-specific knowledge. Our extensive experiments show that VLAS can effectively accomplish robot manipulation tasks with diverse speech commands, offering a seamless and customized interaction experience.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted as a conference paper at ICLR 2025</p></details> |

Traditional approaches to robot control often compartmentalize perception, planning, and decision-making, simplifying system design but limiting the synergy between different information streams. This compartmentalization poses challenges in achieving seamless autonomous reasoning, decision-making, and action execution. To address these limitations, a novel paradigm, named Vision-Language-Action tasks for QUAdruped Robots (QUAR-VLA), has been introduced in this paper. This approach tightly integrates visual information and instructions to generate executable actions, effectively merging perception, planning, and decision-making. The central idea is to elevate the overall intelligence of the robot. Within this framework, a notable challenge lies in aligning fine-grained instructions with visual perception information. This emphasizes the complexity involved in ensuring that the robot accurately interprets and acts upon detailed instructions in harmony with its visual observations. Consequently, we propose QUAdruped Robotic Transformer (QUART), a family of VLA models to integrate visual information and instructions from diverse modalities as input and generates executable actions for real-world robots and present QUAdruped Robot Dataset (QUARD), a large-scale multi-task dataset including navigation, complex terrain locomotion, and whole-body manipulation tasks for training QUART models. Our extensive evaluation (4000 evaluation trials) shows that our approach leads to performant robotic policies and enables QUART to obtain a range of emergent capabilities.</p></details> | Accepted by ECCV2024 |

One such application area is indoor navigation using natural language instructions. However, despite recent progress, this problem remains challenging due to the spatial reasoning and semantic understanding required, particularly in arbitrary scenes that may contain many objects belonging to fine-grained classes. To address this challenge, we curate the largest real-world dataset for Vision and Language-guided Action in 3D Scenes (VLA-3D), consisting of over 11.5K scanned 3D indoor rooms from existing datasets, 23.5M heuristically generated semantic relations between objects, and 9.7M synthetically generated referential statements. Our dataset consists of processed 3D point clouds, semantic object and room annotations, scene graphs, navigable free space annotations, and referential language statements that specifically focus on view-independent spatial relations for disambiguating objects. The goal of these features is to aid the downstream task of navigation, especially on real-world systems where some level of robustness must be guaranteed in an open world of changing scenes and imperfect language.

These advances have spurred the vision of establishing a generalist robotic MLLM proficient in understanding complex human instructions and accomplishing various embodied tasks. However, developing MLLMs for real-world robots is challenging due to the typically limited computation and memory capacities available on robotic platforms. In contrast, the inference of MLLMs involves storing billions of parameters and performing tremendous computation, imposing significant hardware demands. In our paper, we propose a Dynamic Early-Exit Framework for Robotic Vision-Language-Action Model (DeeR-VLA, or simply DeeR) that automatically adjusts the size of the activated MLLM based on each situation at hand. The approach leverages a multi-exit architecture in MLLMs, which allows the model to terminate processing once a proper size of the model has been activated for a specific situation, thus avoiding further redundant computation. Additionally, we develop novel algorithms that establish early-termination criteria for DeeR, conditioned on predefined demands such as average computational cost (i.e., power consumption), as well as peak computational consumption (i.e., latency) and GPU memory usage. These enhancements ensure that DeeR operates efficiently under varying resource constraints while maintaining competitive performance. On the CALVIN robot manipulation benchmark, DeeR demonstrates significant reductions in computational costs of LLM by 5.2-6.5x and GPU memory of LLM by 2-6x without compromising performance. Code and checkpoints are available at https://github.com/yueyang130/DeeR-VLA.</p></details> | <details><summary>25 pa...</summary><p>25 pages, 6 figures, NeurIPS 2024</p></details> |

However, achieving efficient real-time performance remains challenging due to the high computational demands of existing models. To overcome this, we propose Dual Process VLA (DP-VLA), a hierarchical framework inspired by dual-process theory. DP-VLA utilizes a Large System 2 Model (L-Sys2) for complex reasoning and decision-making, while a Small System 1 Model (S-Sys1) handles real-time motor control and sensory processing. By leveraging Vision-Language Models (VLMs), the L-Sys2 operates at low frequencies, reducing computational overhead, while the S-Sys1 ensures fast and accurate task execution. Experimental results on the RoboCasa dataset demonstrate that DP-VLA achieves faster inference and higher task success rates, providing a scalable solution for advanced robotic applications.</p></details> | 10 page |

Robotic scrub nurses have emerged as a promising solution to improve efficiency and reduce human error during surgery. However, challenges remain in terms of accurately grasping and handing over surgical instruments, especially when dealing with complex or difficult objects in dynamic environments. In this work, we introduce a novel robotic scrub nurse system, RoboNurse-VLA, built on a Vision-Language-Action (VLA) model by integrating the Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM 2) and the Llama 2 language model. The proposed RoboNurse-VLA system enables highly precise grasping and handover of surgical instruments in real-time based on voice commands from the surgeon. Leveraging state-of-the-art vision and language models, the system can address key challenges for object detection, pose optimization, and the handling of complex and difficult-to-grasp instruments. Through extensive evaluations, RoboNurse-VLA demonstrates superior performance compared to existing models, achieving high success rates in surgical instrument handovers, even with unseen tools and challenging items. This work presents a significant step forward in autonomous surgical assistance, showcasing the potential of integrating VLA models for real-world medical applications.

To achieve this, we study a widely useful category of navigation tasks we call Multimodal Instruction Navigation with demonstration Tours (MINT), in which the environment prior is provided through a previously recorded demonstration video. Recent advances in Vision Language Models (VLMs) have shown a promising path in achieving this goal as it demonstrates capabilities in perceiving and reasoning about multimodal inputs. However, VLMs are typically trained to predict textual output and it is an open research question about how to best utilize them in navigation. To solve MINT, we present Mobility VLA, a hierarchical Vision-Language-Action (VLA) navigation policy that combines the environment understanding and common sense reasoning power of long-context VLMs and a robust low-level navigation policy based on topological graphs. The high-level policy consists of a long-context VLM that takes the demonstration tour video and the multimodal user instruction as input to find the goal frame in the tour video. Next, a low-level policy uses the goal frame and an offline constructed topological graph to generate robot actions at every timestep. We evaluated Mobility VLA in a 836m^2 real world environment and show that Mobility VLA has a high end-to-end success rates on previously unsolved multimodal instructions such as "Where should I return this?" while holding a plastic bin.

Furthermore, they perform action prediction by learning a direct mapping from perception to action, neglecting the vast dynamics of the world and the relations between actions and dynamics. In contrast, human beings are endowed with world models that depict imagination about future scenarios to plan actions accordingly. To this end, we propose 3D-VLA by introducing a new family of embodied foundation models that seamlessly link 3D perception, reasoning, and action through a generative world model. Specifically, 3D-VLA is built on top of a 3D-based large language model (LLM), and a set of interaction tokens is introduced to engage with the embodied environment. Furthermore, to inject generation abilities into the model, we train a series of embodied diffusion models and align them into the LLM for predicting the goal images and point clouds. To train our 3D-VLA, we curate a large-scale 3D embodied instruction dataset by extracting vast 3D-related information from existing robotics datasets. Our experiments on held-in datasets demonstrate that 3D-VLA significantly improves the reasoning, multimodal generation, and planning capabilities in embodied environments, showcasing its potential in real-world applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://vis-www.cs.umass.edu/3dvla/</p></details> |

| **[PolaRiS: Scalable Real-to-Sim Evaluations for Generalist Robot Policies](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16881v1)** | 2025-12-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A significant challenge for robot learning research is our ability to accurately measure and compare the performance of robot policies. Benchmarking in robotics is historically challenging due to the stochasticity, reproducibility, and time-consuming nature of real-world rollouts. This challenge is exacerbated for recent generalist policies, which has to be evaluated across a wide variety of scenes and tasks. Evaluation in simulation offers a scalable complement to real world evaluations, but the visual and physical domain gap between existing simulation benchmarks and the real world has made them an unreliable signal for policy improvement. Furthermore, building realistic and diverse simulated environments has traditionally required significant human effort and expertise. To bridge the gap, we introduce Policy Evaluation and Environment Reconstruction in Simulation (PolaRiS), a scalable real-to-sim framework for high-fidelity simulated robot evaluation. PolaRiS utilizes neural reconstruction methods to turn short video scans of real-world scenes into interactive simulation environments. Additionally, we develop a simple simulation data co-training recipe that bridges remaining real-to-sim gaps and enables zero-shot evaluation in unseen simulation environments. Through extensive paired evaluations between simulation and the real world, we demonstrate that PolaRiS evaluations provide a much stronger correlation to real world generalist policy performance than existing simulated benchmarks. Its simplicity also enables rapid creation of diverse simulated environments. As such, this work takes a step towards distributed and democratized evaluation for the next generation of robotic foundation models.</p></details> | <details><summary>Websi...</summary><p>Website: https://polaris-evals.github.io/</p></details> |
| **[Forging a Dynamic Memory: Retrieval-Guided Continual Learning for Generalist Medical Foundation Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13072v1)** | 2025-12-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal biomedical Vision-Language Models (VLMs) exhibit immense potential in the field of Continual Learning (CL). However, they confront a core dilemma: how to preserve fine-grained intra-modality features while bridging the significant domain gap across different modalities. To address this challenge, we propose a comprehensive framework. Leveraging our 18-million multimodal and comprehensive medical retrieval database derived from PubMed scientific papers, we pioneer the integration of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) into CL. Specifically, we employ a multi-modal, multi-layer RAG system that provides real-time guidance for model fine-tuning through dynamic, on-demand knowledge retrieval. Building upon this, we introduce a dynamic knowledge distillation framework. This framework precisely resolves the aforementioned core dilemma by dynamically modulating the importance of the parameter space, the granularity of the distilled knowledge, and the data distribution of the reference dataset in accordance with the required level of detail. To thoroughly validate the clinical value of our strategy, we have designed a more rigorous \textbf{M}edical Generalist Task Incremental Learning (MGTIL) benchmark. This benchmark is engineered to simultaneously evaluate the model's capacity for adaptation to significant domain shifts, retention of subtle intra-domain features, and real-time learning of novel and complex medical tasks. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our proposed method achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance across all metrics. The code is provided in the supplementary materials.</p></details> |  |

This path is complicated by fragmented frameworks, slow development, and the absence of standardized evaluation practices. Generalist agents have emerged as a promising direction, excelling on academic benchmarks and offering flexibility across task types, applications, and modalities. Yet, evidence of their use in production enterprise settings remains limited. This paper reports IBM's experience developing and piloting the Computer Using Generalist Agent (CUGA), which has been open-sourced for the community (https://github.com/cuga-project/cuga-agent). CUGA adopts a hierarchical planner--executor architecture with strong analytical foundations, achieving state-of-the-art performance on AppWorld and WebArena. Beyond benchmarks, it was evaluated in a pilot within the Business-Process-Outsourcing talent acquisition domain, addressing enterprise requirements for scalability, auditability, safety, and governance. To support assessment, we introduce BPO-TA, a 26-task benchmark spanning 13 analytics endpoints. In preliminary evaluations, CUGA approached the accuracy of specialized agents while indicating potential for reducing development time and cost. Our contribution is twofold: presenting early evidence of generalist agents operating at enterprise scale, and distilling technical and organizational lessons from this initial pilot. We outline requirements and next steps for advancing research-grade architectures like CUGA into robust, enterprise-ready systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>AAAI ...</summary><p>AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence</p></details> |

Built upon a Gemini foundation model, SIMA 2 represents a significant step toward active, goal-directed interaction within an embodied environment. Unlike prior work (e.g., SIMA 1) limited to simple language commands, SIMA 2 acts as an interactive partner, capable of reasoning about high-level goals, conversing with the user, and handling complex instructions given through language and images. Across a diverse portfolio of games, SIMA 2 substantially closes the gap with human performance and demonstrates robust generalization to previously unseen environments, all while retaining the base model's core reasoning capabilities. Furthermore, we demonstrate a capacity for open-ended self-improvement: by leveraging Gemini to generate tasks and provide rewards, SIMA 2 can autonomously learn new skills from scratch in a new environment. This work validates a path toward creating versatile and continuously learning agents for both virtual and, eventually, physical worlds.</p></details> |  |
| **[Large Language Models as Generalist Policies for Network Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11839v1)** | 2025-12-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Designing control policies to ensure robust network services is essential to modern digital infrastructure. However, the dominant paradigm for network optimization relies on designing specialist policies based on handcrafted rules or deep learning models, leading to poor generalization across diverse tasks and environments. In contrast, large language models (LLMs), pretrained on Internet-scale corpora, provide a rich and unified knowledge base that encodes fundamental networking principles. Combined with their emergent abilities in generalization to unseen scenarios, LLMs offer a transformative foundation for generalist network policies that can generalize across diverse tasks and environments with minimal adaptation. In this paper, we present Trailblazer, the first systematic framework to realize such a generalist policy for networking. Trailblazer incorporates a network alignment scheme to ground the LLM in specific networking tasks, and an adaptive policy collaboration mechanism that offloads simple control cases from the LLM to a lightweight policy for computational efficiency. Through extensive simulations and large-scale real-world online evaluation on Douyin (the Chinese version of TikTok), Trailblazer, powered by a single LLM, demonstrates stronger cross-task and cross-environment generalization than conventional specialist policies. Our results validate LLMs as the foundation for generalist network policies, and position Trailblazer as the first step toward the generalist-driven paradigm that enables strong generalization with minimal efforts in policy design.</p></details> | <details><summary>In su...</summary><p>In submission.

Yet, unlike frontier models, these clinical tools are rarely subjected to independent, quantitative evaluation, creating a critical evidence gap despite their growing influence on diagnosis, triage, and guideline interpretation. We assessed two widely deployed clinical AI systems (OpenEvidence and UpToDate Expert AI) against three state-of-the-art generalist LLMs (GPT-5, Gemini 3 Pro, and Claude Sonnet 4.5) using a 1,000-item mini-benchmark combining MedQA (medical knowledge) and HealthBench (clinician-alignment) tasks. Generalist models consistently outperformed clinical tools, with GPT-5 achieving the highest scores, while OpenEvidence and UpToDate demonstrated deficits in completeness, communication quality, context awareness, and systems-based safety reasoning. These findings reveal that tools marketed for clinical decision support may often lag behind frontier LLMs, underscoring the urgent need for transparent, independent evaluation before deployment in patient-facing workflows.</p></details> | <details><summary>17 pa...</summary><p>17 pages, 4 figures (2 regular, 2 supplemental)</p></details> |
| **[RoboArena: Distributed Real-World Evaluation of Generalist Robot Policies](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18123v2)** | 2025-11-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Comprehensive, unbiased, and comparable evaluation of modern generalist policies is uniquely challenging: existing approaches for robot benchmarking typically rely on heavy standardization, either by specifying fixed evaluation tasks and environments, or by hosting centralized ''robot challenges'', and do not readily scale to evaluating generalist policies across a broad range of tasks and environments. In this work, we propose RoboArena, a new approach for scalable evaluation of generalist robot policies in the real world. Instead of standardizing evaluations around fixed tasks, environments, or locations, we propose to crowd-source evaluations across a distributed network of evaluators. Importantly, evaluators can freely choose the tasks and environments they evaluate on, enabling easy scaling of diversity, but they are required to perform double-blind evaluations over pairs of policies. Then, by aggregating preference feedback from pairwise comparisons across diverse tasks and environments, we can derive a ranking of policies. We instantiate our approach across a network of evaluators at seven academic institutions using the DROID robot platform. Through more than 600 pairwise real-robot evaluation episodes across seven generalist policies, we demonstrate that our crowd-sourced approach can more accurately rank the performance of existing generalist policies than conventional, centralized evaluation approaches, while being more scalable, resilient, and trustworthy. We open our evaluation network to the community and hope that it can enable more accessible comparisons of generalist robot policies.</p></details> | <details><summary>Websi...</summary><p>Website: https://robo-arena.github.io/</p></details> |

To bridge this gap, we propose UMind-VL, a unified foundation model designed to synergize pixel-level structural understanding with complex clinical reasoning. We first introduce UMind-DS, a large-scale multimodal dataset comprising 1.2 million ultrasound image-text pairs across 16 anatomical regions, enriching standard data with pixel-level annotations and clinician-validated rationales. Architecturally, UMind-VL incorporates a lightweight Dynamic Convolutional Mask Decoder that generates masks via dynamic kernels conditioned on LLM outputs. This design, combined with task-specific tokens, unifies segmentation, detection, geometric measurement, and diagnosis tasks within a single framework. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that UMind-VL significantly outperforms existing generalist multimodal models and achieves performance on par with, or superior to, state-of-the-art specialist models across segmentation, detection, keypoint localization, and diagnostic reasoning benchmarks, while maintaining strong generalization ability. We demonstrate the capability of UMind-VL in Figure 1.</p></details> |  |
| **[Health system learning achieves generalist neuroimaging models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18640v1)** | 2025-11-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Frontier artificial intelligence (AI) models, such as OpenAI's GPT-5 and Meta's DINOv3, have advanced rapidly through training on internet-scale public data, yet such systems lack access to private clinical data. Neuroimaging, in particular, is underrepresented in the public domain due to identifiable facial features within MRI and CT scans, fundamentally restricting model performance in clinical medicine. Here, we show that frontier models underperform on neuroimaging tasks and that learning directly from uncurated data generated during routine clinical care at health systems, a paradigm we call health system learning, yields high-performance, generalist neuroimaging models. We introduce NeuroVFM, a visual foundation model trained on 5.24 million clinical MRI and CT volumes using a scalable volumetric joint-embedding predictive architecture. NeuroVFM learns comprehensive representations of brain anatomy and pathology, achieving state-of-the-art performance across multiple clinical tasks, including radiologic diagnosis and report generation. The model exhibits emergent neuroanatomic understanding and interpretable visual grounding of diagnostic findings. When paired with open-source language models through lightweight visual instruction tuning, NeuroVFM generates radiology reports that surpass frontier models in accuracy, clinical triage, and expert preference. Through clinically grounded visual understanding, NeuroVFM reduces hallucinated findings and critical errors, offering safer clinical decision support. These results establish health system learning as a paradigm for building generalist medical AI and provide a scalable framework for clinical foundation models.</p></details> | <details><summary>53 pa...</summary><p>53 pages, 4 main figures, 10 extended data figures</p></details> |

We pursue a road less traveled: building generalist policies directly around VLMs by augmenting their general capabilities with specific robot capabilities encapsulated in a carefully curated set of perception, planning, and control modules. In Maestro, a VLM coding agent dynamically composes these modules into a programmatic policy for the current task and scenario. Maestro's architecture benefits from a streamlined closed-loop interface without many manually imposed structural constraints, and a comprehensive and diverse tool repertoire. As a result, it largely surpasses today's VLA models for zero-shot performance on challenging manipulation skills. Further, Maestro is easily extensible to incorporate new modules, easily editable to suit new embodiments such as a quadruped-mounted arm, and even easily adapts from minimal real-world experiences through local code edits.</p></details> | <details><summary>Plan ...</summary><p>Plan to resubmit after significant revisions</p></details> |

Despite strong performance on medical knowledge and conversational benchmarks, foundation models trained on general text may lack the specialized knowledge required for these operational decisions. We introduce Lang1, a family of models (100M-7B parameters) pretrained on a specialized corpus blending 80B clinical tokens from NYU Langone Health's EHRs and 627B tokens from the internet. To rigorously evaluate Lang1 in real-world settings, we developed the REalistic Medical Evaluation (ReMedE), a benchmark derived from 668,331 EHR notes that evaluates five critical tasks: 30-day readmission prediction, 30-day mortality prediction, length of stay, comorbidity coding, and predicting insurance claims denial. In zero-shot settings, both general-purpose and specialized models underperform on four of five tasks (36.6%-71.7% AUROC), with mortality prediction being an exception. After finetuning, Lang1-1B outperforms finetuned generalist models up to 70x larger and zero-shot models up to 671x larger, improving AUROC by 3.64%-6.75% and 1.66%-23.66% respectively. We also observed cross-task scaling with joint finetuning on multiple tasks leading to improvement on other tasks. Lang1-1B effectively transfers to out-of-distribution settings, including other clinical tasks and an external health system. Our findings suggest that predictive capabilities for hospital operations require explicit supervised finetuning, and that this finetuning process is made more efficient by in-domain pretraining on EHR. Our findings support the emerging view that specialized LLMs can compete with generalist models in specialized tasks, and show that effective healthcare systems AI requires the combination of in-domain pretraining, supervised finetuning, and real-world evaluation beyond proxy benchmarks.</p></details> |  |

Here we introduce MATAI, a generalist machine learning framework for property prediction and inverse design of as-cast alloys. MATAI integrates a curated alloy database, deep neural network-based property predictors, a constraint-aware optimization engine, and an iterative AI-experiment feedback loop. The framework estimates key mechanical propertie, sincluding density, yield strength, ultimate tensile strength, and elongation, directly from composition, using multi-task learning and physics-informed inductive biases. Alloy design is framed as a constrained optimization problem and solved using a bi-level approach that combines local search with symbolic constraint programming. We demonstrate MATAI's capabilities on the Ti-based alloy system, a canonical class of lightweight structural materials, where it rapidly identifies candidates that simultaneously achieve lower density (<4.45 g/cm3), higher strength (>1000 MPa) and appreciable ductility (>5%) through only seven iterations. Experimental validation confirms that MATAI-designed alloys outperform commercial references such as TC4, highlighting the framework's potential to accelerate the discovery of lightweight, high-performance materials under real-world design constraints.</p></details> |  |

Lumine adopts a human-like interaction paradigm that unifies perception, reasoning, and action in an end-to-end manner, powered by a vision-language model. It processes raw pixels at 5 Hz to produce precise 30 Hz keyboard-mouse actions and adaptively invokes reasoning only when necessary. Trained in Genshin Impact, Lumine successfully completes the entire five-hour Mondstadt main storyline on par with human-level efficiency and follows natural language instructions to perform a broad spectrum of tasks in both 3D open-world exploration and 2D GUI manipulation across collection, combat, puzzle-solving, and NPC interaction. In addition to its in-domain performance, Lumine demonstrates strong zero-shot cross-game generalization. Without any fine-tuning, it accomplishes 100-minute missions in Wuthering Waves and the full five-hour first chapter of Honkai: Star Rail. These promising results highlight Lumine's effectiveness across distinct worlds and interaction dynamics, marking a concrete step toward generalist agents in open-ended environments.</p></details> |  |

To bridge this gap, we introduce UniVA, an open-source, omni-capable multi-agent framework for next-generation video generalists that unifies video understanding, segmentation, editing, and generation into cohesive workflows. UniVA employs a Plan-and-Act dual-agent architecture that drives a highly automated and proactive workflow: a planner agent interprets user intentions and decomposes them into structured video-processing steps, while executor agents execute these through modular, MCP-based tool servers (for analysis, generation, editing, tracking, etc.). Through a hierarchical multi-level memory (global knowledge, task context, and user-specific preferences), UniVA sustains long-horizon reasoning, contextual continuity, and inter-agent communication, enabling interactive and self-reflective video creation with full traceability. This design enables iterative and any-conditioned video workflows (e.g., text/image/video-conditioned generation $\rightarrow$ multi-round editing $\rightarrow$ object segmentation $\rightarrow$ compositional synthesis) that were previously cumbersome to achieve with single-purpose models or monolithic video-language models. We also introduce UniVA-Bench, a benchmark suite of multi-step video tasks spanning understanding, editing, segmentation, and generation, to rigorously evaluate such agentic video systems.

In this paper, we introduce Hulu-Med, a transparent, generalist medical Vision-Language Model (VLM) designed to unify language-only, 2D/3D vision-language, and video understanding within a single architecture. Hulu-Med is trained on a curated corpus of 16.7 million samples, comprising exclusively public or synthetic data, spanning 12 major anatomical systems and 14 medical imaging modalities. Hulu-Med employs a medical-aware token-reduction strategy that prunes redundant visual tokens, achieving up to a 55% reduction for 3D and video inputs, improving cross-modal efficiency, and enabling training at 7B-32B parameter scales in approximately 4,000-40,000 GPU hours. Across 30 public in-domain and out-of-domain medical benchmarks-covering text reasoning, visual question answering, report generation, multilingual dialogue, video understanding, and rare disease diagnosis-Hulu-Med surpasses existing open-source models on 27 of 30 benchmarks and outperforms proprietary systems such as GPT-4o on 16 benchmarks. Despite being a VLM, Hulu-Med outperforms GPT-4o and matches GPT-o1 on the text-only HealthBench. For the first time in the community, we provide a fully transparent, reproducible and cost-effective pipeline for holistic medical vision-language understanding by releasing our end-to-end data curation, training procedures, and model parameters.

However, traditional LLM structures including Transformer, Linear Attention, and hybrid models do not employ specialized memory mechanism guided by task information. In this paper, we present Nirvana, an SGM with specialized memory mechanism, linear time complexity, and test-time task information extraction. Besides, we propose the Task-Aware Memory Trigger ($\textit{Trigger}$) that flexibly adjusts memory mechanism based on the current task's requirements. In Trigger, each incoming sample is treated as a self-supervised fine-tuning task, enabling Nirvana to adapt its task-related parameters on the fly to domain shifts. We also design the Specialized Memory Updater ($\textit{Updater}$) that dynamically memorizes the context guided by Trigger. We conduct experiments on both general language tasks and specialized medical tasks. On a variety of natural language modeling benchmarks, Nirvana achieves competitive or superior results compared to the existing LLM structures. To prove the effectiveness of Trigger on specialized tasks, we test Nirvana's performance on a challenging medical task, i.e., Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI). We post-train frozen Nirvana backbone with lightweight codecs on paired electromagnetic signals and MRI images. Despite the frozen Nirvana backbone, Trigger guides the model to adapt to the MRI domain with the change of task-related parameters. Nirvana achieves higher-quality MRI reconstruction compared to conventional MRI models as well as the models with traditional LLMs' backbone, and can also generate accurate preliminary clinical reports accordingly.</p></details> |  |
| **[PANDA: Towards Generalist Video Anomaly Detection via Agentic AI Engineer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26386v2)** | 2025-10-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video anomaly detection (VAD) is a critical yet challenging task due to the complex and diverse nature of real-world scenarios. Previous methods typically rely on domain-specific training data and manual adjustments when applying to new scenarios and unseen anomaly types, suffering from high labor costs and limited generalization. Therefore, we aim to achieve generalist VAD, \ie, automatically handle any scene and any anomaly types without training data or human involvement. In this work, we propose PANDA, an agentic AI engineer based on MLLMs. Specifically, we achieve PANDA by comprehensively devising four key capabilities: (1) self-adaptive scene-aware strategy planning, (2) goal-driven heuristic reasoning, (3) tool-augmented self-reflection, and (4) self-improving chain-of-memory. Concretely, we develop a self-adaptive scene-aware RAG mechanism, enabling PANDA to retrieve anomaly-specific knowledge for anomaly detection strategy planning. Next, we introduce a latent anomaly-guided heuristic prompt strategy to enhance reasoning precision. Furthermore, PANDA employs a progressive reflection mechanism alongside a suite of context-aware tools to iteratively refine decision-making in complex scenarios. Finally, a chain-of-memory mechanism enables PANDA to leverage historical experiences for continual performance improvement. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PANDA achieves state-of-the-art performance in multi-scenario, open-set, and complex scenario settings without training and manual involvement, validating its generalizable and robust anomaly detection capability.

However, despite the potential of text inpainting methods, three key limitations hinder their applicability to broader Text Image Manipulation (TIM) tasks: (i) the inability to remove text, (ii) the lack of control over the style of rendered text, and (iii) a tendency to generate duplicated letters. To address these challenges, we propose OmniText, a training-free generalist capable of performing a wide range of TIM tasks. Specifically, we investigate two key properties of cross- and self-attention mechanisms to enable text removal and to provide control over both text styles and content. Our findings reveal that text removal can be achieved by applying self-attention inversion, which mitigates the model's tendency to focus on surrounding text, thus reducing text hallucinations. Additionally, we redistribute cross-attention, as increasing the probability of certain text tokens reduces text hallucination. For controllable inpainting, we introduce novel loss functions in a latent optimization framework: a cross-attention content loss to improve text rendering accuracy and a self-attention style loss to facilitate style customization. Furthermore, we present OmniText-Bench, a benchmark dataset for evaluating diverse TIM tasks. It includes input images, target text with masks, and style references, covering diverse applications such as text removal, rescaling, repositioning, and insertion and editing with various styles. Our OmniText framework is the first generalist method capable of performing diverse TIM tasks. It achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple tasks and metrics compared to other text inpainting methods and is comparable with specialist methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>The f...</summary><p>The first two authors contributed equally to this work.

Unlike API- or GUI-based approaches, this paradigm enables large-scale continual pre-training across heterogeneous domains, including OS, web, and simulation games. Game-TARS is pre-trained on over 500B tokens with diverse trajectories and multimodal data. Key techniques include a decaying continual loss to reduce causal confusion and an efficient Sparse-Thinking strategy that balances reasoning depth and inference cost. Experiments show that Game-TARS achieves about 2 times the success rate over the previous sota model on open-world Minecraft tasks, is close to the generality of fresh humans in unseen web 3d games, and outperforms GPT-5, Gemini-2.5-Pro, and Claude-4-Sonnet in FPS benchmarks. Scaling results on training-time and test-time confirm that the unified action space sustains improvements when scaled to cross-game and multimodal data. Our results demonstrate that simple, scalable action representations combined with large-scale pre-training provide a promising path toward generalist agents with broad computer-use abilities.</p></details> |  |

To address the above challenges, we propose Omni-Reward, a step toward generalist omni-modal reward modeling with support for free-form preferences, consisting of: (1) Evaluation: We introduce Omni-RewardBench, the first omni-modal RM benchmark with free-form preferences, covering nine tasks across five modalities including text, image, video, audio, and 3D; (2) Data: We construct Omni-RewardData, a multimodal preference dataset comprising 248K general preference pairs and 69K instruction-tuning pairs for training generalist omni-modal RMs; (3) Model: We propose Omni-RewardModel, which includes both discriminative and generative RMs, and achieves strong performance on Omni-RewardBench as well as other widely used reward modeling benchmarks.</p></details> | 48 pages, 17 figures |

Yet their rapid rise raises a key question: should researchers train specialist models from scratch, fine-tune generalist foundation models, or use hybrid approaches? The trade-offs in data efficiency, accuracy, cost, and robustness to out-of-distribution failure remain unclear. We introduce a benchmarking framework using defect migration pathways, evaluated through nudged elastic band trajectories, as diagnostic probes that test both interpolation and extrapolation. Using Cr-doped Sb2Te3 as a representative two-dimensional material, we benchmark multiple training paradigms within the MACE architecture across equilibrium, kinetic (atomic migration), and mechanical (interlayer sliding) tasks. Fine-tuned models substantially outperform from-scratch and zero-shot approaches for kinetic properties but show partial loss of long-range physics. Representational analysis reveals distinct, non-overlapping latent encodings, indicating that different training strategies learn different aspects of system physics. This framework provides practical guidelines for MLFF development and establishes migration-based probes as efficient diagnostics linking performance to learned representations, guiding future uncertainty-aware active learning.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages (+Appendix 22 pages), 8 figures.

| **[Normal-Abnormal Guided Generalist Anomaly Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00495v3)** | 2025-10-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generalist Anomaly Detection (GAD) aims to train a unified model on an original domain that can detect anomalies in new target domains. Previous GAD methods primarily use only normal samples as references, overlooking the valuable information contained in anomalous samples that are often available in real-world scenarios. To address this limitation, we propose a more practical approach: normal-abnormal-guided generalist anomaly detection, which leverages both normal and anomalous samples as references to guide anomaly detection across diverse domains. We introduce the Normal-Abnormal Generalist Learning (NAGL) framework, consisting of two key components: Residual Mining (RM) and Anomaly Feature Learning (AFL). RM extracts abnormal patterns from normal-abnormal reference residuals to establish transferable anomaly representations, while AFL adaptively learns anomaly features in query images through residual mapping to identify instance-aware anomalies. Our approach effectively utilizes both normal and anomalous references for more accurate and efficient cross-domain anomaly detection. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing GAD approaches. This work represents the first to adopt a mixture of normal and abnormal samples as references in generalist anomaly detection. The code and datasets are available at https://github.com/JasonKyng/NAGL.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by NeurIPS 2025</p></details> |

In this task, current open-source models present a large performance gap with commercial ones, which limits various applications such as data synthesis. To bridge the gap, this paper proposes CapFlow, a novel multi-agent collaboration workflow. CapFlow demonstrates for the first time that, by capitalizing on open-source models, it is possible to achieve caption quality on par with GPT-4.1 in various domains with an 89.5% reduction in costs. By leveraging CapFlow as the data synthesizer, we produce high-quality visual captions from image and video domains at scale, and obtain a generalist visual captioner via fine-tuning, namely MetaCaptioner. Through extensive experiments, we show that MetaCaptioner not only achieves comparable captioning capabilities with commercial models but also reaches top-tier multimodal performance in the open-source community. We hope CapFlow and MetaCaptioner can benefit future multimodal research by providing a strong and cost-effective visual captioning solution.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards Generalist Intelligence in Dentistry: Vision Foundation Models for Oral and Maxillofacial Radiology](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14532v1)** | 2025-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Oral and maxillofacial radiology plays a vital role in dental healthcare, but radiographic image interpretation is limited by a shortage of trained professionals. While AI approaches have shown promise, existing dental AI systems are restricted by their single-modality focus, task-specific design, and reliance on costly labeled data, hindering their generalization across diverse clinical scenarios. To address these challenges, we introduce DentVFM, the first family of vision foundation models (VFMs) designed for dentistry. DentVFM generates task-agnostic visual representations for a wide range of dental applications and uses self-supervised learning on DentVista, a large curated dental imaging dataset with approximately 1.6 million multi-modal radiographic images from various medical centers. DentVFM includes 2D and 3D variants based on the Vision Transformer (ViT) architecture. To address gaps in dental intelligence assessment and benchmarks, we introduce DentBench, a comprehensive benchmark covering eight dental subspecialties, more diseases, imaging modalities, and a wide geographical distribution. DentVFM shows impressive generalist intelligence, demonstrating robust generalization to diverse dental tasks, such as disease diagnosis, treatment analysis, biomarker identification, and anatomical landmark detection and segmentation. Experimental results indicate DentVFM significantly outperforms supervised, self-supervised, and weakly supervised baselines, offering superior generalization, label efficiency, and scalability. Additionally, DentVFM enables cross-modality diagnostics, providing more reliable results than experienced dentists in situations where conventional imaging is unavailable. DentVFM sets a new paradigm for dental AI, offering a scalable, adaptable, and label-efficient model to improve intelligent dental healthcare and address critical gaps in global oral healthcare.</p></details> |  |
| **[Generalist vs Specialist Time Series Foundation Models: Investigating Potential Emergent Behaviors in Assessing Human Health Using PPG Signals](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14254v1)** | 2025-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Foundation models are large-scale machine learning models that are pre-trained on massive amounts of data and can be adapted for various downstream tasks. They have been extensively applied to tasks in Natural Language Processing and Computer Vision with models such as GPT, BERT, and CLIP. They are now also increasingly gaining attention in time-series analysis, particularly for physiological sensing. However, most time series foundation models are specialist models - with data in pre-training and testing of the same type, such as Electrocardiogram, Electroencephalogram, and Photoplethysmogram (PPG). Recent works, such as MOMENT, train a generalist time series foundation model with data from multiple domains, such as weather, traffic, and electricity. This paper aims to conduct a comprehensive benchmarking study to compare the performance of generalist and specialist models, with a focus on PPG signals. Through an extensive suite of total 51 tasks covering cardiac state assessment, laboratory value estimation, and cross-modal inference, we comprehensively evaluate both models across seven dimensions, including win score, average performance, feature quality, tuning gain, performance variance, transferability, and scalability. These metrics jointly capture not only the models' capability but also their adaptability, robustness, and efficiency under different fine-tuning strategies, providing a holistic understanding of their strengths and limitations for diverse downstream scenarios. In a full-tuning scenario, we demonstrate that the specialist model achieves a 27% higher win score. Finally, we provide further analysis on generalization, fairness, attention visualizations, and the importance of training data choice.</p></details> |  |

Its core idea is spatially guided vision-language-action training, where spatial grounding serves as the critical link between instructions and robot actions. InternVLA-M1 employs a two-stage pipeline: (i) spatial grounding pre-training on over 2.3M spatial reasoning data to determine ``where to act'' by aligning instructions with visual, embodiment-agnostic positions, and (ii) spatially guided action post-training to decide ``how to act'' by generating embodiment-aware actions through plug-and-play spatial prompting. This spatially guided training recipe yields consistent gains: InternVLA-M1 outperforms its variant without spatial guidance by +14.6% on SimplerEnv Google Robot, +17% on WidowX, and +4.3% on LIBERO Franka, while demonstrating stronger spatial reasoning capability in box, point, and trace prediction. To further scale instruction following, we built a simulation engine to collect 244K generalizable pick-and-place episodes, enabling a 6.2% average improvement across 200 tasks and 3K+ objects. In real-world clustered pick-and-place, InternVLA-M1 improved by 7.3%, and with synthetic co-training, achieved +20.6% on unseen objects and novel configurations. Moreover, in long-horizon reasoning-intensive scenarios, it surpassed existing works by over 10%. These results highlight spatially guided training as a unifying principle for scalable and resilient generalist robots.

| **[Generalist++: A Meta-learning Framework for Mitigating Trade-off in Adversarial Training](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13361v1)** | 2025-10-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite the rapid progress of neural networks, they remain highly vulnerable to adversarial examples, for which adversarial training (AT) is currently the most effective defense. While AT has been extensively studied, its practical applications expose two major limitations: natural accuracy tends to degrade significantly compared with standard training, and robustness does not transfer well across attacks crafted under different norm constraints. Unlike prior works that attempt to address only one issue within a single network, we propose to partition the overall generalization goal into multiple sub-tasks, each assigned to a dedicated base learner. By specializing in its designated objective, each base learner quickly becomes an expert in its field. In the later stages of training, we interpolate their parameters to form a knowledgeable global learner, while periodically redistributing the global parameters back to the base learners to prevent their optimization trajectories from drifting too far from the shared target. We term this framework Generalist and introduce three variants tailored to different application scenarios. Both theoretical analysis and extensive experiments demonstrate that Generalist achieves lower generalization error and significantly alleviates the trade-off problems compared with baseline methods. Our results suggest that Generalist provides a promising step toward developing fully robust classifiers in the future.</p></details> |  |
| **[DICEPTION: A Generalist Diffusion Model for Visual Perceptual Tasks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17157v3)** | 2025-10-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper's primary objective is to develop a robust generalist perception model capable of addressing multiple tasks under constraints of computational resources and limited training data. We leverage text-to-image diffusion models pre-trained on billions of images and successfully introduce our DICEPTION, a visual generalist model. Exhaustive evaluations demonstrate that DICEPTION effectively tackles diverse perception tasks, even achieving performance comparable to SOTA single-task specialist models. Specifically, we achieve results on par with SAM-vit-h using only 0.06% of their data (e.g., 600K vs.\ 1B pixel-level annotated images). We designed comprehensive experiments on architectures and input paradigms, demonstrating that the key to successfully re-purposing a single diffusion model for multiple perception tasks lies in maximizing the preservation of the pre-trained model's prior knowledge. Consequently, DICEPTION can be trained with substantially lower computational costs than conventional models requiring training from scratch. Furthermore, adapting DICEPTION to novel tasks is highly efficient, necessitating fine-tuning on as few as 50 images and approximately 1% of its parameters. Finally, we demonstrate that a subtle application of classifier-free guidance can improve the model's performance on depth and normal estimation. We also show that pixel-aligned training, as is characteristic of perception tasks, significantly enhances the model's ability to preserve fine details. DICEPTION offers valuable insights and presents a promising direction for the development of advanced diffusion-based visual generalist models.

However, data availability is often restricted in the medical domain due to patient privacy concerns. Synthetic data presents a possible solution to these challenges. Recently, image generative models have found increasing use for medical applications but are often designed for singular medical specialties and imaging modalities, thus limiting their broader utility. To address this, we introduce MediSyn: a text-guided, latent diffusion model capable of generating synthetic images from 6 medical specialties and 10 image types. Through extensive experimentation, we first demonstrate that MediSyn quantitatively matches or surpasses the performance of specialist models. Second, we show that our synthetic images are realistic and exhibit strong alignment with their corresponding text prompts, as validated by a team of expert physicians. Third, we provide empirical evidence that our synthetic images are visually distinct from their corresponding real patient images. Finally, we demonstrate that in data-limited settings, classifiers trained solely on synthetic data or real data supplemented with synthetic data can outperform those trained solely on real data. Our findings highlight the immense potential of generalist image generative models to accelerate algorithmic research and development in medicine.</p></details> |  |
| **[Scaling Generalist Data-Analytic Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25084v1)** | 2025-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Data-analytic agents are emerging as a key catalyst for automated scientific discovery and for the vision of Innovating AI. Current approaches, however, rely heavily on prompt engineering over proprietary models, while open-source models struggle to face diverse-format, large-scale data files and long-horizon, multi-step reasoning that real-world analytics demands. This paper introduces DataMind, a scalable data synthesis and agent training recipe designed to build generalist data-analytic agents. DataMind tackles three key challenges in building open-source data-analytic agents, including insufficient data resources, improper training strategy, and unstable code-based multi-turn rollout. Concretely, DataMind applies 1) a fine-grained task taxonomy and a recursive easy-to-hard task composition mechanism to increase the diversity and difficulty of synthesized queries; 2) a knowledge-augmented trajectory sampling strategy followed by model-based and rule-based filtering; 3) a dynamically adjustable training objective combining both SFT and RL losses; 4) a memory-frugal and stable code-based multi-turn rollout framework. Built on DataMind, we curate DataMind-12K, a high-quality trajectory set spanning diverse domains, task categories, and data file formats for data-analytic tasks. Trained on DataMind-12K, our DataMind-14B achieves state-of-the-art with an average score of 71.16% on multiple data analysis benchmarks, outperforming the strongest proprietary baselines DeepSeek-V3.1 and GPT-5. Our DataMind-7B also performs best among all open-source models with a score of 68.10%. We also incorporate some empirical insights gained from our exploratory trials into the analysis experiments, aiming to provide actionable insights about agentic training for the community. We will release DataMind-12K and DataMind-7B,14B for the community's future research.</p></details> | Work in progress |

To tackle this problem, we propose GMS: Generalist Scanner Meets Specialist Locator, a synergistic coarse-to-fine framework that effectively improves GUI grounding performance. GMS leverages the complementary strengths of general vision-language models (VLMs) and small, task-specific GUI grounding models by assigning them distinct roles within the framework. Specifically, the general VLM acts as a 'Scanner' to identify potential regions of interest, while the fine-tuned grounding model serves as a 'Locator' that outputs precise coordinates within these regions. This design is inspired by how humans perform GUI grounding, where the eyes scan the interface and the brain focuses on interpretation and localization. Our whole framework consists of five stages and incorporates hierarchical search with cross-modal communication to achieve promising prediction results. Experimental results on the ScreenSpot-Pro dataset show that while the 'Scanner' and 'Locator' models achieve only $2.0\%$ and $3.7\%$ accuracy respectively when used independently, their integration within GMS framework yields an overall accuracy of $35.7\%$, representing a $10 \times$ improvement. Additionally, GMS significantly outperforms other strong baselines under various settings, demonstrating its robustness and potential for general-purpose GUI grounding.</p></details> |  |

We present LocoFormer, a generalist omni-bodied locomotion model that can control previously unseen legged and wheeled robots, even without precise knowledge of their kinematics. LocoFormer is able to adapt to changes in morphology and dynamics at test time. We find that two key choices enable adaptation. First, we train massive scale RL on procedurally generated robots with aggressive domain randomization. Second, in contrast to previous policies that are myopic with short context lengths, we extend context by orders of magnitude to span episode boundaries. We deploy the same LocoFormer to varied robots and show robust control even with large disturbances such as weight change and motor failures. In extreme scenarios, we see emergent adaptation across episodes, LocoFormer learns from falls in early episodes to improve control strategies in later ones. We believe that this simple, yet general recipe can be used to train foundation models for other robotic skills in the future.

Recently, the incentivization of reasoning capabilities in LLMs from RL indicates that $\textit{proper learning methods could enable effective inference-time scalability}$. A key challenge of RL is to obtain accurate reward signals for LLMs in various domains beyond verifiable questions or artificial rules. In this work, we investigate how to improve reward modeling (RM) with more inference compute for general queries, i.e. the $\textbf{inference-time scalability of generalist RM}$, and further, how to improve the effectiveness of performance-compute scaling with proper learning methods. For the RM approach, we adopt pointwise generative reward modeling (GRM) to enable flexibility for different input types and potential for inference-time scaling. For the learning method, we propose Self-Principled Critique Tuning (SPCT) to foster scalable reward generation behaviors in GRMs through online RL, to generate principles adaptively and critiques accurately, resulting in $\textbf{DeepSeek-GRM}$ models. Furthermore, for effective inference-time scaling, we use parallel sampling to expand compute usage, and introduce a meta RM to guide voting process for better scaling performance. Empirically, we show that SPCT significantly improves the quality and scalability of GRMs, outperforming existing methods and models in various RM benchmarks without severe biases, and could achieve better performance compared to training-time scaling. DeepSeek-GRM still meets challenges in some tasks, which we believe can be addressed by future efforts in generalist reward systems.

A key challenge remains: scaling high-quality, action-labeled robot demonstration data, which existing methods rely on for robustness and generalization. To address this, we propose a method that benefits from videos without action labels - featuring humans and/or robots in action - enhancing open-vocabulary performance and enabling data-efficient learning of new tasks. Our method extracts dense, dynamic 3D point clouds at the hand or gripper location and uses a proposed 3D dynamics predictor for self-supervision. This predictor is then tuned to an action predictor using a smaller labeled dataset for action alignment. We show that our method not only learns from unlabeled human and robot demonstrations - improving downstream generalist robot policies - but also enables robots to learn new tasks without action labels (i.e., out-of-action generalization) in both real-world and simulated settings.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at Conference on Robot Learning 2025</p></details> |

This allows for more accurate identification, and their public availability from missions, such as Sentinel-2 and Landsat, only adds to their value. Currently, the automatic analysis of such data is predominantly managed through machine learning models specifically trained for multi-spectral input, which are costly to train and support. Furthermore, although providing a lot of utility for Remote Sensing, such additional inputs cannot be used with powerful generalist large multimodal models, which are capable of solving many visual problems, but are not able to understand specialized multi-spectral signals. To address this, we propose a training-free approach which introduces new multi-spectral data in a Zero-Shot-only mode, as inputs to generalist multimodal models, trained on RGB-only inputs. Our approach leverages the multimodal models' understanding of the visual space, and proposes to adapt to inputs to that space, and to inject domain-specific information as instructions into the model. We exemplify this idea with the Gemini2.5 model and observe strong Zero-Shot performance gains of the approach on popular Remote Sensing benchmarks for land cover and land use classification and demonstrate the easy adaptability of Gemini2.5 to new inputs. These results highlight the potential for geospatial professionals, working with non-standard specialized inputs, to easily leverage powerful multimodal models, such as Gemini2.5, to accelerate their work, benefiting from their rich reasoning and contextual capabilities, grounded in the specialized sensor data.</p></details> |  |

Despite these successes, open-vocabulary autonomous drone navigation remains an unsolved challenge due to the scarcity of large-scale demonstrations, real-time control demands of drones for stabilization, and lack of reliable external pose estimation modules. In this work, we present SINGER for language-guided autonomous drone navigation in the open world using only onboard sensing and compute. To train robust, open-vocabulary navigation policies, SINGER leverages three central components: (i) a photorealistic language-embedded flight simulator with minimal sim-to-real gap using Gaussian Splatting for efficient data generation, (ii) an RRT-inspired multi-trajectory generation expert for collision-free navigation demonstrations, and these are used to train (iii) a lightweight end-to-end visuomotor policy for real-time closed-loop control. Through extensive hardware flight experiments, we demonstrate superior zero-shot sim-to-real transfer of our policy to unseen environments and unseen language-conditioned goal objects. When trained on ~700k-1M observation action pairs of language conditioned visuomotor data and deployed on hardware, SINGER outperforms a velocity-controlled semantic guidance baseline by reaching the query 23.33% more on average, and maintains the query in the field of view 16.67% more on average, with 10% fewer collisions.</p></details> |  |

Such methods often fail to scale, as every new problem or application requires time-consuming and iterative reward definition and tuning. We present Generalist Contact-Conditioned Policy (GeCCo) -- a low-level policy trained with Deep Reinforcement Learning that is capable of tracking arbitrary contact points on a quadruped robot. The strength of our approach is that it provides a general and modular low-level controller that can be reused for a wider range of high-level tasks, without the need to re-train new controllers from scratch. We demonstrate the scalability and robustness of our method by evaluating on a wide range of locomotion and manipulation tasks in a common framework and under a single generalist policy. These include a variety of gaits, traversing complex terrains (eg. stairs and slopes) as well as previously unseen stepping-stones and narrow beams, and interacting with objects (eg. pushing buttons, tracking trajectories). Our framework acquires new behaviors more efficiently, simply by combining a task-specific high-level contact planner and the pre-trained generalist policy.

Benchmarking and Strategic Insights](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17337v2)** | 2025-09-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision Language Models (VLMs) have shown promise in automating image diagnosis and interpretation in clinical settings. However, developing specialist medical VLMs requires substantial computational resources and carefully curated datasets, and it remains unclear under which conditions generalist and specialist medical VLMs each perform best. This study highlights the complementary strengths of specialist medical and generalist VLMs. Specialists remain valuable in modality-aligned use cases, but we find that efficiently fine-tuned generalist VLMs can achieve comparable or even superior performance in most tasks, particularly when transferring to unseen or rare OOD medical modalities. These results suggest that generalist VLMs, rather than being constrained by their lack of specialist medical pretraining, may offer a scalable and cost-effective pathway for advancing clinical AI development.</p></details> | version 2 |
| **[Kolb-Based Experiential Learning for Generalist Agents with Human-Level Kaggle Data Science Performance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03562v3)** | 2025-09-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Human expertise emerges through iterative cycles of interaction, reflection, and internal model updating, which are central to cognitive theories such as Kolb's experiential learning and Vygotsky's zone of proximal development. In contrast, current AI systems, particularly LLM agents, rely on static pre-training or rigid workflows, lacking mechanisms for continual adaptation. Recent studies identified early cognitive traits in LLM agents (reflection, revision, and self-correction) suggesting foundational elements of human-like experiential learning. Thus the key question: Can we design LLM agents capable of structured, cognitively grounded learning similar to human processes? In response, we propose a computational framework of Kolb's learning cycle with Vygotsky's ZPD for autonomous agents. Our architecture separates extrinsic (environment interaction) and intrinsic (internal reflection/abstraction) functions, enabling cognitively grounded scaffolded learning, where the agent initially learns within structured environments, followed by open-ended generalisation. This approach empowers agents to master complex tasks ; domains that traditional fine-tuning or simple reflective methods could not tackle effectively. Its potential is powerfully demonstrated via direct comparison with humans in real-world Kaggle data science competitions. Learning fully automated data science code generation across 81 tasks, our system, Agent K, demonstrated the ability to perform the entire workflow autonomously, achieving an Elo-MMR score of 1694, beyond median score of the Kaggle Masters (the top 2% among 200,000 users) of our study. With 9 gold, 8 silver, and 12 bronze medals level performance - including 4 gold and 4 silver on prize-awarding competitions - Agent K is the 1st AI system to successfully integrate Kolb- and Vygotsky-inspired human cognitive learning, marking a major step toward generalist AI.</p></details> |  |

However, executing such manoeuvres requires precise temporal coordination and complex agent-environment interactions. Moreover, legged locomotion is inherently more prone to slippage and tripping, and the classical approach of modeling such cases to design a robust controller thus quickly becomes impractical. In contrast, reinforcement learning offers a compelling solution by enabling optimal control through trial and error. We present a generalist reinforcement learning algorithm for quadrupedal agents in dynamic motion scenarios. The learned policy rivals state-of-the-art specialist policies trained using a mixture of experts approach, while using only 25% as many agents during training. Our experiments also highlight the key components of the generalist locomotion policy and the primary factors contributing to its success.</p></details> | <details><summary>Suppl...</summary><p>Supplementary material can be found here: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/18h25azbCFfPF4fhSsRfxKrnZo3dPKs_j?usp=sharing</p></details> |
| **[Dita: Scaling Diffusion Transformer for Generalist Vision-Language-Action Policy](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19757v2)** | 2025-09-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While recent vision-language-action models trained on diverse robot datasets exhibit promising generalization capabilities with limited in-domain data, their reliance on compact action heads to predict discretized or continuous actions constrains adaptability to heterogeneous action spaces. We present Dita, a scalable framework that leverages Transformer architectures to directly denoise continuous action sequences through a unified multimodal diffusion process. Departing from prior methods that condition denoising on fused embeddings via shallow networks, Dita employs in-context conditioning -- enabling fine-grained alignment between denoised actions and raw visual tokens from historical observations. This design explicitly models action deltas and environmental nuances. By scaling the diffusion action denoiser alongside the Transformer's scalability, Dita effectively integrates cross-embodiment datasets across diverse camera perspectives, observation scenes, tasks, and action spaces. Such synergy enhances robustness against various variances and facilitates the successful execution of long-horizon tasks. Evaluations across extensive benchmarks demonstrate state-of-the-art or comparative performance in simulation. Notably, Dita achieves robust real-world adaptation to environmental variances and complex long-horizon tasks through 10-shot finetuning, using only third-person camera inputs. The architecture establishes a versatile, lightweight and open-source baseline for generalist robot policy learning.

Despite recent advancements that have enabled the creation of autonomous software agents utilizing LLMs for end-to-end development tasks, these systems are typically designed for specific SE functions. We introduce HyperAgent, an innovative generalist multi-agent system designed to tackle a wide range of SE tasks across different programming languages by mimicking the workflows of human developers. HyperAgent features four specialized agents-Planner, Navigator, Code Editor, and Executor-capable of handling the entire lifecycle of SE tasks, from initial planning to final verification. HyperAgent sets new benchmarks in diverse SE tasks, including GitHub issue resolution on the renowned SWE-Bench benchmark, outperforming robust baselines. Furthermore, HyperAgent demonstrates exceptional performance in repository-level code generation (RepoExec) and fault localization and program repair (Defects4J), often surpassing state-of-the-art baselines.</p></details> | 49 pages |
| **[Generalist versus Specialist Vision Foundation Models for Ocular Disease and Oculomics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03421v1)** | 2025-09-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Medical foundation models, pre-trained with large-scale clinical data, demonstrate strong performance in diverse clinically relevant applications. RETFound, trained on nearly one million retinal images, exemplifies this approach in applications with retinal images. However, the emergence of increasingly powerful and multifold larger generalist foundation models such as DINOv2 and DINOv3 raises the question of whether domain-specific pre-training remains essential, and if so, what gap persists. To investigate this, we systematically evaluated the adaptability of DINOv2 and DINOv3 in retinal image applications, compared to two specialist RETFound models, RETFound-MAE and RETFound-DINOv2. We assessed performance on ocular disease detection and systemic disease prediction using two adaptation strategies: fine-tuning and linear probing. Data efficiency and adaptation efficiency were further analysed to characterise trade-offs between predictive performance and computational cost. Our results show that although scaling generalist models yields strong adaptability across diverse tasks, RETFound-DINOv2 consistently outperforms these generalist foundation models in ocular-disease detection and oculomics tasks, demonstrating stronger generalisability and data efficiency. These findings suggest that specialist retinal foundation models remain the most effective choice for clinical applications, while the narrowing gap with generalist foundation models suggests that continued data and model scaling can deliver domain-relevant gains and position them as strong foundations for future medical foundation models.</p></details> | 39 pages, 8 Figures |
| **[OmniActor: A Generalist GUI and Embodied Agent for 2D&3D Worlds](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02322v1)** | 2025-09-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal large language models are evolving toward multimodal agents capable of proactively executing tasks. Most agent research focuses on GUI or embodied scenarios, which correspond to agents interacting with 2D virtual worlds or 3D real worlds, respectively. However, many complex tasks typically require agents to interleavely interact with these two types of environment. We initially mix GUI and embodied data to train, but find the performance degeneration brought by the data conflict. Further analysis reveals that GUI and embodied data exhibit synergy and conflict at the shallow and deep layers, respectively, which resembles the cerebrum-cerebellum mechanism in the human brain. To this end, we propose a high-performance generalist agent OmniActor, designed from both structural and data perspectives. First, we propose Layer-heterogeneity MoE to eliminate the conflict between GUI and embodied data by separating deep-layer parameters, while leverage their synergy by sharing shallow-layer parameters. By successfully leveraging the synergy and eliminating the conflict, OmniActor outperforms agents only trained by GUI or embodied data in GUI or embodied tasks. Furthermore, we unify the action spaces of GUI and embodied tasks, and collect large-scale GUI and embodied data from various sources for training. This significantly improves OmniActor under different scenarios, especially in GUI tasks. The code will be publicly available.</p></details> |  |
| **[From Experts to a Generalist: Toward General Whole-Body Control for Humanoid Robots](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12779v3)** | 2025-09-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Achieving general agile whole-body control on humanoid robots remains a major challenge due to diverse motion demands and data conflicts. While existing frameworks excel in training single motion-specific policies, they struggle to generalize across highly varied behaviors due to conflicting control requirements and mismatched data distributions. In this work, we propose BumbleBee (BB), an expert-generalist learning framework that combines motion clustering and sim-to-real adaptation to overcome these challenges. BB first leverages an autoencoder-based clustering method to group behaviorally similar motions using motion features and motion descriptions. Expert policies are then trained within each cluster and refined with real-world data through iterative delta action modeling to bridge the sim-to-real gap. Finally, these experts are distilled into a unified generalist controller that preserves agility and robustness across all motion types. Experiments on two simulations and a real humanoid robot demonstrate that BB achieves state-of-the-art general whole-body control, setting a new benchmark for agile, robust, and generalizable humanoid performance in the real world.

However, the exploration of versatile EEG models is constrained by diverse data formats, outdated pre-training paradigms, and limited transfer learning methods, only leading to specialist models on single dataset. In this paper, we introduce EEGPT, the first generalist EEG foundation model designed to address these challenges. First, we propose an electrode-wise modeling strategy that treats each electrode as a fundamental unit, enabling the integration of diverse EEG datasets collected from up to 138 electrodes, amassing 37.5M pre-training samples. Second, we develop the first autoregressive EEG pre-trained model, moving away from traditional masked autoencoder approaches to a next signal prediction task that better captures the sequential and temporal dependencies of EEG data. We also explore scaling laws with model up to 1.1B parameters: the largest in EEG research to date. Third, we introduce a multi-task transfer learning paradigm using a learnable electrode graph network shared across tasks, which for the first time confirms multi-task compatibility and synergy. As the first generalist EEG foundation model, EEGPT shows broad compatibility with various signal acquisition devices, subjects, and tasks. It supports up to 138 electrodes and any combination thereof as input. Furthermore, we simultaneously evaluate it on 5 distinct tasks across 12 benchmarks. EEGPT consistently outperforms existing specialist models across all downstream tasks, with its effectiveness further validated through extensive ablation studies. This work sets a new direction for generalist EEG modeling, offering improved scalability, transferability, and adaptability for a wide range of EEG applications. The code and models will be released.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work has been submitted to the IEEE for possible publication</p></details> |

To address these challenges, we introduce CLARIFY, a Specialist-Generalist framework for dermatological visual question answering (VQA). CLARIFY combines two components: (i) a lightweight, domain-trained image classifier (the Specialist) that provides fast and highly accurate diagnostic predictions, and (ii) a powerful yet compressed conversational VLM (the Generalist) that generates natural language explanations to user queries. In our framework, the Specialist's predictions directly guide the Generalist's reasoning, focusing it on the correct diagnostic path. This synergy is further enhanced by a knowledge graph-based retrieval module, which grounds the Generalist's responses in factual dermatological knowledge, ensuring both accuracy and reliability. This hierarchical design not only reduces diagnostic errors but also significantly improves computational efficiency. Experiments on our curated multimodal dermatology dataset demonstrate that CLARIFY achieves an 18\% improvement in diagnostic accuracy over the strongest baseline, a fine-tuned, uncompressed single-line VLM, while reducing the average VRAM requirement and latency by at least 20\% and 5\%, respectively. These results indicate that a Specialist-Generalist system provides a practical and powerful paradigm for building lightweight, trustworthy, and clinically viable AI systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 8 figures, Prepared for submission to IEEE Transactions on Human-Machine Systems</p></details> |

Recent machine learning breakthroughs have heralded policies that master individual skills like reaching, object manipulation and locomotion in musculoskeletal systems with many degrees of freedom. However, these agents are merely "specialists", achieving high performance for a single skill. In this work, we develop Arnold, a generalist policy that masters multiple tasks and embodiments. Arnold combines behavior cloning and fine-tuning with PPO to achieve expert or super-expert performance in 14 challenging control tasks from dexterous object manipulation to locomotion. A key innovation is Arnold's sensorimotor vocabulary, a compositional representation of the semantics of heterogeneous sensory modalities, objectives, and actuators. Arnold leverages this vocabulary via a transformer architecture to deal with the variable observation and action spaces of each task. This framework supports efficient multi-task, multi-embodiment learning and facilitates rapid adaptation to novel tasks. Finally, we analyze Arnold to provide insights into biological motor control, corroborating recent findings on the limited transferability of muscle synergies across tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>A.S.C...</summary><p>A.S.C. and B.A. contributed equally.

While deep learning has achieved progress in individual tasks, existing approaches are often anatomy- or application-specific and lack generalizability across diverse clinical settings. Moreover, current pipelines rarely integrate imaging data with complementary language information that radiologists rely on in routine practice. Here, we introduce OmniMRI, a unified vision-language foundation model designed to generalize across the entire MRI workflow. OmniMRI is trained on a large-scale, heterogeneous corpus curated from 60 public datasets, over 220,000 MRI volumes and 19 million MRI slices, incorporating image-only data, paired vision-text data, and instruction-response data. Its multi-stage training paradigm, comprising self-supervised vision pretraining, vision-language alignment, multimodal pretraining, and multi-task instruction tuning, progressively equips the model with transferable visual representations, cross-modal reasoning, and robust instruction-following capabilities. Qualitative results demonstrate OmniMRI's ability to perform diverse tasks within a single architecture, including MRI reconstruction, anatomical and pathological segmentation, abnormality detection, diagnostic suggestion, and radiology report generation. These findings highlight OmniMRI's potential to consolidate fragmented pipelines into a scalable, generalist framework, paving the way toward foundation models that unify imaging and clinical language for comprehensive, end-to-end MRI interpretation.</p></details> |  |

While it is possible for humans to manually create immersive and interactive worlds through 3D graphics, as seen in applications such as VR, gaming, and robotics, this process remains highly labor-intensive. In this paper, we propose a scalable method for generating high-quality 3D environments that can serve as training data for foundation models. We recast 3D environment building as a sequential decision-making problem, employing Vision-Language-Models (VLMs) as policies that output actions to jointly craft a 3D environment's layout, materials, lighting, and assets. Our proposed framework, 3D-Generalist, trains VLMs to generate more prompt-aligned 3D environments via self-improvement fine-tuning. We demonstrate the effectiveness of 3D-Generalist and the proposed training strategy in generating simulation-ready 3D environments. Furthermore, we demonstrate its quality and scalability in synthetic data generation by pretraining a vision foundation model on the generated data. After fine-tuning the pre-trained model on downstream tasks, we show that it surpasses models pre-trained on meticulously human-crafted synthetic data and approaches results achieved with real data orders of magnitude larger.</p></details> | <details><summary>proje...</summary><p>project website: https://ai.stanford.edu/~sunfanyun/3d-generalist/</p></details> |
| **[Shortcut Learning in Generalist Robot Policies: The Role of Dataset Diversity and Fragmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06426v1)** | 2025-08-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generalist robot policies trained on large-scale datasets such as Open X-Embodiment (OXE) demonstrate strong performance across a wide range of tasks. However, they often struggle to generalize beyond the distribution of their training data. In this paper, we investigate the underlying cause of this limited generalization capability. We identify shortcut learning -- the reliance on task-irrelevant features -- as a key impediment to generalization. Through comprehensive theoretical and empirical analysis, we uncover two primary contributors to shortcut learning: (1) limited diversity within individual sub-datasets, and (2) significant distributional disparities across sub-datasets, leading to dataset fragmentation. These issues arise from the inherent structure of large-scale datasets like OXE, which are typically composed of multiple sub-datasets collected independently across varied environments and embodiments. Our findings provide critical insights into dataset collection strategies that can reduce shortcut learning and enhance the generalization ability of generalist robot policies. Moreover, in scenarios where acquiring new large-scale data is impractical, we demonstrate that carefully selected robotic data augmentation strategies can effectively reduce shortcut learning in existing offline datasets, thereby improving generalization capabilities of generalist robot policies, e.g., $π_0$, in both simulation and real-world environments.

| **[DP-DGAD: A Generalist Dynamic Graph Anomaly Detector with Dynamic Prototypes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00664v1)** | 2025-08-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Dynamic graph anomaly detection (DGAD) is essential for identifying anomalies in evolving graphs across domains such as finance, traffic, and social networks. Recently, generalist graph anomaly detection (GAD) models have shown promising results. They are pretrained on multiple source datasets and generalize across domains. While effective on static graphs, they struggle to capture evolving anomalies in dynamic graphs. Moreover, the continuous emergence of new domains and the lack of labeled data further challenge generalist DGAD. Effective cross-domain DGAD requires both domain-specific and domain-agnostic anomalous patterns. Importantly, these patterns evolve temporally within and across domains. Building on these insights, we propose a DGAD model with Dynamic Prototypes (DP) to capture evolving domain-specific and domain-agnostic patterns. Firstly, DP-DGAD extracts dynamic prototypes, i.e., evolving representations of normal and anomalous patterns, from temporal ego-graphs and stores them in a memory buffer. The buffer is selectively updated to retain general, domain-agnostic patterns while incorporating new domain-specific ones. Then, an anomaly scorer compares incoming data with dynamic prototypes to flag both general and domain-specific anomalies. Finally, DP-DGAD employs confidence-based pseudo-labeling for effective self-supervised adaptation in target domains. Extensive experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art performance across ten real-world datasets from different domains.</p></details> |  |

Despite their effectiveness in broad applications, generalist models are primarily trained on web-scale datasets dominated by natural images, resulting in the sacrifice of specialized capabilities for domain-specific tasks that require extensive domain prior knowledge. Moreover, directly integrating expert models tailored for specific domains is challenging due to the representational gap and imbalanced optimization between the generalist model and experts. To address these challenges, we introduce Chimera, a scalable and low-cost multi-modal pipeline designed to boost the ability of existing LMMs with domain-specific experts. Specifically, we design a progressive training strategy to integrate features from expert models into the input of a generalist LMM. To address the imbalanced optimization caused by the well-aligned general visual encoder, we introduce a novel Generalist-Specialist Collaboration Masking (GSCM) mechanism.

However, existing molecular generative models can only tackle some of these tasks. We present Generalist Molecular generative model (GenMol), a versatile framework that uses only a single discrete diffusion model to handle diverse drug discovery scenarios. GenMol generates Sequential Attachment-based Fragment Embedding (SAFE) sequences through non-autoregressive bidirectional parallel decoding, thereby allowing the utilization of a molecular context that does not rely on the specific token ordering while having better sampling efficiency. GenMol uses fragments as basic building blocks for molecules and introduces fragment remasking, a strategy that optimizes molecules by regenerating masked fragments, enabling effective exploration of chemical space. We further propose molecular context guidance (MCG), a guidance method tailored for masked discrete diffusion of GenMol. GenMol significantly outperforms the previous GPT-based model in de novo generation and fragment-constrained generation, and achieves state-of-the-art performance in goal-directed hit generation and lead optimization. These results demonstrate that GenMol can tackle a wide range of drug discovery tasks, providing a unified and versatile approach for molecular design.

In this paper, we identify a strong correlation between a vision model's perceptual ability and its generalist forecasting performance over short time horizons. This trend holds across a diverse set of pretrained models-including those trained generatively-and across multiple levels of abstraction, from raw pixels to depth, point tracks, and object motion. The result is made possible by a novel generalist forecasting framework that operates on any frozen vision backbone: we train latent diffusion models to forecast future features in the frozen representation space, which are then decoded via lightweight, task-specific readouts. To enable consistent evaluation across tasks, we introduce distributional metrics that compare distributional properties directly in the space of downstream tasks and apply this framework to nine models and four tasks. Our results highlight the value of bridging representation learning and generative modeling for temporally grounded video understanding.</p></details> |  |

However, current judge models suffer from narrow specialization and limited robustness, undermining their capacity for comprehensive evaluations. In this work, we present CompassJudger-2, a novel generalist judge model that overcomes these limitations via a task-driven, multi-domain data curation strategy. Central to our approach is supervising judgment tasks with verifiable rewards, guiding intrinsic critical reasoning through rejection sampling to foster robust, generalizable judgment capabilities. We introduce a refined learning objective with margin policy gradient loss to enhance performance. Empirically, CompassJudger-2 achieves superior results across multiple judge and reward benchmarks, and our 7B model demonstrates competitive judgment accuracy with significantly larger models like DeepSeek-V3 and Qwen3-235B-A22B. Additionally, we propose JudgerBenchV2, a comprehensive benchmark evaluating cross-domain judgment accuracy and rank consistency to standardize judge model evaluation. These contributions advance robust, scalable LLM judgment and establish new performance and evaluation standards.</p></details> |  |

| **[Do We Really Need Specialization? Evaluating Generalist Text Embeddings for Zero-Shot Recommendation and Search](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05006v2)** | 2025-07-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Pre-trained language models (PLMs) are widely used to derive semantic representations from item metadata in recommendation and search. In sequential recommendation, PLMs enhance ID-based embeddings through textual metadata, while in product search, they align item characteristics with user intent. Recent studies suggest task and domain-specific fine-tuning are needed to improve representational power. This paper challenges this assumption, showing that Generalist Text Embedding Models (GTEs), pre-trained on large-scale corpora, can guarantee strong zero-shot performance without specialized adaptation. Our experiments demonstrate that GTEs outperform traditional and fine-tuned models in both sequential recommendation and product search. We attribute this to a superior representational power, as they distribute features more evenly across the embedding space. Finally, we show that compressing embedding dimensions by focusing on the most informative directions (e.g., via PCA) effectively reduces noise and improves the performance of specialized models. To ensure reproducibility, we provide our repository at https://split.to/gte4ps.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accept as Short Paper at RecSys 2025</p></details> |
| **[The Generalist Brain Module: Module Repetition in Neural Networks in Light of the Minicolumn Hypothesis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12473v1)** | 2025-07-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While modern AI continues to advance, the biological brain remains the pinnacle of neural networks in its robustness, adaptability, and efficiency. This review explores an AI architectural path inspired by the brain's structure, particularly the minicolumn hypothesis, which views the neocortex as a distributed system of repeated modules - a structure we connect to collective intelligence (CI). Despite existing work, there is a lack of comprehensive reviews connecting the cortical column to the architectures of repeated neural modules. This review aims to fill that gap by synthesizing historical, theoretical, and methodological perspectives on neural module repetition. We distinguish between architectural repetition - reusing structure - and parameter-shared module repetition, where the same functional unit is repeated across a network. The latter exhibits key CI properties such as robustness, adaptability, and generalization. Evidence suggests that the repeated module tends to converge toward a generalist module: simple, flexible problem solvers capable of handling many roles in the ensemble. This generalist tendency may offer solutions to longstanding challenges in modern AI: improved energy efficiency during training through simplicity and scalability, and robust embodied control via generalization. While empirical results suggest such systems can generalize to out-of-distribution problems, theoretical results are still lacking. Overall, architectures featuring module repetition remain an emerging and unexplored architectural strategy, with significant untapped potential for both efficiency, robustness, and adaptiveness. We believe that a system that adopts the benefits of CI, while adhering to architectural and functional principles of the minicolumns, could challenge the modern AI problems of scalability, energy consumption, and democratization.</p></details> |  |
| **[Generalist Reward Models: Found Inside Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23235v1)** | 2025-06-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The alignment of Large Language Models (LLMs) is critically dependent on reward models trained on costly human preference data. While recent work explores bypassing this cost with AI feedback, these methods often lack a rigorous theoretical foundation. In this paper, we discover that a powerful generalist reward model is already latently present within any LLM trained via standard next-token prediction. We prove that this endogenous reward is not a heuristic, but is theoretically equivalent to a reward function learned through offline inverse reinforcement learning. This connection allows us to directly elicit a high-quality reward signal from a base (pre-trained or supervised fine-tuned) model without any further training. Critically, we also prove that subsequent reinforcement learning using this endogenous reward leads to a policy with a provably superior error bound compared to the base model. To our best knowledge, this is the first theoretical proof of the effectiveness of reinforcement learning for LLMs. Our experiments validate this theory, demonstrating that our method not only outperforms existing LLM-as-a-judge approaches but can also surpass explicitly trained reward models. These findings suggest that the reward modeling stage can be replaced by a principled method of eliciting the knowledge already captured during pre-training, heralding a more efficient, powerful, and scalable paradigm for LLMs alignment as well as multi-modal models.</p></details> |  |
| **[Unifying Biomedical Vision-Language Expertise: Towards a Generalist Foundation Model via Multi-CLIP Knowledge Distillation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22567v1)** | 2025-06-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>CLIP models pretrained on natural images with billion-scale image-text pairs have demonstrated impressive capabilities in zero-shot classification, cross-modal retrieval, and open-ended visual answering. However, transferring this success to biomedicine is hindered by the scarcity of large-scale biomedical image-text corpora, the heterogeneity of image modalities, and fragmented data standards across institutions. These limitations hinder the development of a unified and generalizable biomedical foundation model trained from scratch. To overcome this, we introduce MMKD-CLIP, a generalist biomedical foundation model developed via Multiple Medical CLIP Knowledge Distillation. Rather than relying on billion-scale raw data, MMKD-CLIP distills knowledge from nine state-of-the-art domain-specific or generalist biomedical CLIP models, each pretrained on millions of biomedical image-text pairs. Our two-stage training pipeline first performs CLIP-style pretraining on over 2.9 million biomedical image-text pairs from 26 image modalities, followed by feature-level distillation using over 19.2 million feature pairs extracted from teacher models. We evaluate MMKD-CLIP on 58 diverse biomedical datasets, encompassing over 10.8 million biomedical images across nine image modalities. The evaluation spans six core task types: zero-shot classification, linear probing, cross-modal retrieval, visual question answering, survival prediction, and cancer diagnosis. MMKD-CLIP consistently outperforms all teacher models while demonstrating remarkable robustness and generalization across image domains and task settings. These results underscore that multi-teacher knowledge distillation is a scalable and effective paradigm for building high-performing biomedical foundation models under the practical constraints of real-world data availability.</p></details> |  |
| **[Med-LEGO: Editing and Adapting toward Generalist Medical Image Diagnosis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01164v2)** | 2025-06-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The adoption of visual foundation models has become a common practice in computer-aided diagnosis (CAD). While these foundation models provide a viable solution for creating generalist medical AI, privacy concerns make it difficult to pre-train or continuously update such models across multiple domains and datasets, leading many studies to focus on specialist models. To address this challenge, we propose Med-LEGO, a training-free framework that enables the seamless integration or updating of a generalist CAD model by combining multiple specialist models, similar to assembling LEGO bricks. Med-LEGO enhances LoRA (low-rank adaptation) by incorporating singular value decomposition (SVD) to efficiently capture the domain expertise of each specialist model with minimal additional parameters. By combining these adapted weights through simple operations, Med-LEGO allows for the easy integration or modification of specific diagnostic capabilities without the need for original data or retraining. Finally, the combined model can be further adapted to new diagnostic tasks, making it a versatile generalist model. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that Med-LEGO outperforms existing methods in both cross-domain and in-domain medical tasks while using only 0.18% of full model parameters. These merged models show better convergence and generalization to new tasks, providing an effective path toward generalist medical AI.</p></details> | <details><summary>Medic...</summary><p>Medical Image Computing and Computer Assisted Intervention (MICCAI) 2025</p></details> |

However, current training paradigms face critical limitations, including reliance on outcome supervision and labor-intensive human annotations. To address these challenges, we propose Similar, a Step-Wise Multi-Dimensional Generalist Reward Model, which offers fine-grained signals for agent training and can choose better action for inference-time scaling. Specifically, we begin by systematically defining five dimensions for evaluating agent actions. Building on this framework, we design an MCTS-P algorithm to automatically collect and annotate step-wise, five-dimensional agent execution data. Using this data, we train Similar with the Triple-M strategy. Furthermore, we introduce the first benchmark in the virtual agent domain for step-wise, multi-dimensional reward model training and evaluation, named SRM. This benchmark consists of two components: SRMTrain, which serves as the training set for Similar, and SRMEval, a manually selected test set for evaluating the reward model. Experimental results demonstrate that Similar, through its step-wise, multi-dimensional assessment and synergistic gain, provides GVAs with effective intermediate signals during both training and inference-time scaling.

| **[AgentSynth: Scalable Task Generation for Generalist Computer-Use Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14205v1)** | 2025-06-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce AgentSynth, a scalable and cost-efficient pipeline for automatically synthesizing high-quality tasks and trajectory datasets for generalist computer-use agents. Leveraging information asymmetry, AgentSynth constructs subtasks that are simple during generation but significantly more challenging when composed into long-horizon tasks, enabling the creation of over 6,000 diverse and realistic tasks. Our pipeline begins with an LLM-based task proposer guided by a persona, followed by an execution agent that completes the task and logs the trajectory. This process is repeated iteratively to form a sequence of subtasks, which are then summarized by a separate agent into a composite task of controllable difficulty. A key strength of AgentSynth is its ability to precisely modulate task complexity by varying the number of subtasks. Empirical evaluations show that state-of-the-art LLM agents suffer a steep performance drop, from 18% success at difficulty level 1 to just 4% at level 6, highlighting the benchmark's difficulty and discriminative power. Moreover, our pipeline achieves a low average cost of \$0.60 per trajectory, orders of magnitude cheaper than human annotations. Our code and data are publicly available at https://github.com/sunblaze-ucb/AgentSynth</p></details> |  |

The introduction of Segment Anything Model (SAM) set a milestone on segmentation of natural images, inspiring the design of a multitude of architectures for medical image segmentation. In this survey we offer a comprehensive and in-depth investigation on generalist models for medical image segmentation. We start with an introduction on the fundamentals concepts underpinning their development. Then, we provide a taxonomy on the different declinations of SAM in terms of zero-shot, few-shot, fine-tuning, adapters, on the recent SAM 2, on other innovative models trained on images alone, and others trained on both text and images. We thoroughly analyze their performances at the level of both primary research and best-in-literature, followed by a rigorous comparison with the state-of-the-art task-specific models. We emphasize the need to address challenges in terms of compliance with regulatory frameworks, privacy and security laws, budget, and trustworthy artificial intelligence (AI). Finally, we share our perspective on future directions concerning synthetic data, early fusion, lessons learnt from generalist models in natural language processing, agentic AI and physical AI, and clinical translation.</p></details> | <details><summary>132 p...</summary><p>132 pages, 26 figures, 23 tables.

However, building a generalist agent with capabilities such as perception, planning, action, grounding, and reflection in open-world environments like Minecraft remains challenges: insufficient domain-specific data, interference among heterogeneous tasks, and visual diversity in open-world settings. In this paper, we address these challenges through three key contributions. 1) We propose a knowledge-enhanced data generation pipeline to provide scalable and high-quality training data for agent development. 2) To mitigate interference among heterogeneous tasks, we introduce a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture with task-level routing. 3) We develop a Multimodal Reasoning-Augmented Reinforcement Learning approach to enhance the agent's reasoning ability for visual diversity in Minecraft. Built upon these innovations, we present Optimus-3, a general-purpose agent for Minecraft. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that Optimus-3 surpasses both generalist multimodal large language models and existing state-of-the-art agents across a wide range of tasks in the Minecraft environment.

The generalist model is a general framework trained with massive data and is able to process various downstream tasks simultaneously. Encouraged by their impressive performance, an increasing number of researchers are venturing into the realm of applying these models to computer vision tasks. However, the inputs and outputs of vision tasks are more diverse, and it is difficult to summarize them as a unified representation. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive overview of the vision generalist models, delving into their characteristics and capabilities within the field. First, we review the background, including the datasets, tasks, and benchmarks. Then, we dig into the design of frameworks that have been proposed in existing research, while also introducing the techniques employed to enhance their performance. To better help the researchers comprehend the area, we take a brief excursion into related domains, shedding light on their interconnections and potential synergies. To conclude, we provide some real-world application scenarios, undertake a thorough examination of the persistent challenges, and offer insights into possible directions for future research endeavors.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by International Journal of Computer Vision (IJCV)</p></details> |
| **[OctoNav: Towards Generalist Embodied Navigation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09839v1)** | 2025-06-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Embodied navigation stands as a foundation pillar within the broader pursuit of embodied AI. However, previous navigation research is divided into different tasks/capabilities, e.g., ObjNav, ImgNav and VLN, where they differ in task objectives and modalities, making datasets and methods are designed individually. In this work, we take steps toward generalist navigation agents, which can follow free-form instructions that include arbitrary compounds of multi-modal and multi-capability. To achieve this, we propose a large-scale benchmark and corresponding method, termed OctoNav-Bench and OctoNav-R1. Specifically, OctoNav-Bench features continuous environments and is constructed via a designed annotation pipeline. We thoroughly craft instruction-trajectory pairs, where instructions are diverse in free-form with arbitrary modality and capability. Also, we construct a Think-Before-Action (TBA-CoT) dataset within OctoNav-Bench to provide the thinking process behind actions. For OctoNav-R1, we build it upon MLLMs and adapt it to a VLA-type model, which can produce low-level actions solely based on 2D visual observations. Moreover, we design a Hybrid Training Paradigm (HTP) that consists of three stages, i.e., Action-/TBA-SFT, Nav-GPRO, and Online RL stages. Each stage contains specifically designed learning policies and rewards. Importantly, for TBA-SFT and Nav-GRPO designs, we are inspired by the OpenAI-o1 and DeepSeek-R1, which show impressive reasoning ability via thinking-before-answer. Thus, we aim to investigate how to achieve thinking-before-action in the embodied navigation field, to improve model's reasoning ability toward generalists. Specifically, we propose TBA-SFT to utilize the TBA-CoT dataset to fine-tune the model as a cold-start phrase and then leverage Nav-GPRO to improve its thinking ability. Finally, OctoNav-R1 shows superior performance compared with previous methods.</p></details> | 31 pages, 25 figures |

We present MedVersa, a generalist foundation model trained on tens of millions of compiled medical instances. MedVersa unlocks generalist learning from multimodal inputs and outputs, representing the first example of a generalist model reaching competitive performance with leading specialized solutions across a variety of medical imaging scenarios. MedVersa achieves state-of-the-art performance in nine tasks, sometimes outperforming counterparts by over 10%. Radiologist evaluation shows MedVersa-generated reports get superior performance in 95% of normal studies, while matching or exceeding human reports in 71% of cases overall. User studies showed notable reductions in report writing time and discrepancies with the use of MedVersa. Our findings underscore the value of flexible, multimodal AI systems in advancing medical image interpretation and supporting clinical expertise.</p></details> | Technical study |

To achieve it, we propose the RAPID Hand, a co-optimized hardware and software platform where the compact 20-DoF hand, robust whole-hand perception, and high-DoF teleoperation interface are jointly designed. Specifically, RAPID Hand adopts a compact and practical hand ontology and a hardware-level perception framework that stably integrates wrist-mounted vision, fingertip tactile sensing, and proprioception with sub-7 ms latency and spatial alignment. Collecting high-quality demonstrations on high-DoF hands is challenging, as existing teleoperation methods struggle with precision and stability on complex multi-fingered systems. We address this by co-optimizing hand design, perception integration, and teleoperation interface through a universal actuation scheme, custom perception electronics, and two retargeting constraints. We evaluate the platform's hardware, perception, and teleoperation interface. Training a diffusion policy on collected data shows superior performance over prior works, validating the system's capability for reliable, high-quality data collection. The platform is constructed from low-cost and off-the-shelf components and will be made public to ensure reproducibility and ease of adoption.</p></details> |  |
| **[Modality-Specialized Synergizers for Interleaved Vision-Language Generalists](https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03604v2)** | 2025-06-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have led to the emergence of Vision-Language Generalists (VLGs) capable of understanding and generating both text and images. However, seamlessly generating an arbitrary sequence of text and images remains a challenging task for the current VLGs. One primary limitation lies in applying a unified architecture and the same set of parameters to simultaneously model discrete text tokens and continuous image features. Recent works attempt to tackle this fundamental problem by introducing modality-aware expert models. However, they employ identical architectures to process both text and images, disregarding the intrinsic inductive biases in these two modalities. In this work, we introduce MODALITY-SPECIALIZED SYNERGIZERS (MOSS), a novel design that efficiently optimizes existing unified architectures of VLGs with modality-specialized adaptation layers, i.e., a Convolutional LoRA for modeling the local priors of image patches and a Linear LoRA for processing sequential text. This design enables more effective modeling of modality-specific features while maintaining the strong cross-modal integration gained from pretraining. In addition, to improve the instruction-following capability on interleaved text-and-image generation, we introduce LEAFINSTRUCT, the first open-sourced interleaved instruction tuning dataset comprising 184,982 high-quality instances on more than 10 diverse domains. Extensive experiments show that VLGs integrated with M OSS achieve state-of-the-art performance, significantly surpassing baseline VLGs in complex interleaved generation tasks. Furthermore, our method exhibits strong generalizability on different VLGs.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 Pag...</summary><p>8 Pages, interleaved instruction tuning, parameter-efficient tuning, image understanding, image generation</p></details> |
| **[Zero-shot Generalist Graph Anomaly Detection with Unified Neighborhood Prompts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14886v2)** | 2025-06-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph anomaly detection (GAD), which aims to identify nodes in a graph that significantly deviate from normal patterns, plays a crucial role in broad application domains. However, existing GAD methods are one-model-for-one-dataset approaches, i.e., training a separate model for each graph dataset. This largely limits their applicability in real-world scenarios. To overcome this limitation, we propose a novel zero-shot generalist GAD approach UNPrompt that trains a one-for-all detection model, requiring the training of one GAD model on a single graph dataset and then effectively generalizing to detect anomalies in other graph datasets without any retraining or fine-tuning. The key insight in UNPrompt is that i) the predictability of latent node attributes can serve as a generalized anomaly measure and ii) generalized normal and abnormal graph patterns can be learned via latent node attribute prediction in a properly normalized node attribute space. UNPrompt achieves a generalist mode for GAD through two main modules: one module aligns the dimensionality and semantics of node attributes across different graphs via coordinate-wise normalization, while another module learns generalized neighborhood prompts that support the use of latent node attribute predictability as an anomaly score across different datasets. Extensive experiments on real-world GAD datasets show that UNPrompt significantly outperforms diverse competing methods under the generalist GAD setting, and it also has strong superiority under the one-model-for-one-dataset setting. Code is available at https://github.com/mala-lab/UNPrompt.</p></details> | Accepted by IJCAI25 |

In this work, we introduce visual trace prompting, a simple yet effective approach to facilitate VLA models' spatial-temporal awareness for action prediction by encoding state-action trajectories visually. We develop a new TraceVLA model by finetuning OpenVLA on our own collected dataset of 150K robot manipulation trajectories using visual trace prompting. Evaluations of TraceVLA across 137 configurations in SimplerEnv and 4 tasks on a physical WidowX robot demonstrate state-of-the-art performance, outperforming OpenVLA by 10% on SimplerEnv and 3.5x on real-robot tasks and exhibiting robust generalization across diverse embodiments and scenarios. To further validate the effectiveness and generality of our method, we present a compact VLA model based on 4B Phi-3-Vision, pretrained on the Open-X-Embodiment and finetuned on our dataset, rivals the 7B OpenVLA baseline while significantly improving inference efficiency.</p></details> |  |

Unlike prior efforts that rely heavily on template based queries, ReXVQA introduces a diverse and clinically authentic task suite reflecting five core radiological reasoning skills: presence assessment, location analysis, negation detection, differential diagnosis, and geometric reasoning. We evaluate eight state-of-the-art multimodal large language models, including MedGemma-4B-it, Qwen2.5-VL, Janus-Pro-7B, and Eagle2-9B. The best-performing model (MedGemma) achieves 83.24% overall accuracy. To bridge the gap between AI performance and clinical expertise, we conducted a comprehensive human reader study involving 3 radiology residents on 200 randomly sampled cases. Our evaluation demonstrates that MedGemma achieved superior performance (83.84% accuracy) compared to human readers (best radiology resident: 77.27%), representing a significant milestone where AI performance exceeds expert human evaluation on chest X-ray interpretation. The reader study reveals distinct performance patterns between AI models and human experts, with strong inter-reader agreement among radiologists while showing more variable agreement patterns between human readers and AI models. ReXVQA establishes a new standard for evaluating generalist radiological AI systems, offering public leaderboards, fine-grained evaluation splits, structured explanations, and category-level breakdowns. This benchmark lays the foundation for next-generation AI systems capable of mimicking expert-level clinical reasoning beyond narrow pathology classification. Our dataset will be open-sourced at https://huggingface.co/datasets/rajpurkarlab/ReXVQA</p></details> |  |
| **[Coding Agents with Multimodal Browsing are Generalist Problem Solvers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03011v1)** | 2025-06-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modern human labor is characterized by specialization; we train for years and develop particular tools that allow us to perform well across a variety of tasks. In addition, AI agents have been specialized for domains such as software engineering, web navigation, and workflow automation. However, this results in agents that are good for one thing but fail to generalize beyond their intended scope. One reason for this is that agent developers provide a highly specialized set of tools or make architectural decisions optimized for a specific use case or benchmark. In this work, we ask the question: what is the minimal set of general tools that can be used to achieve high performance across a diverse set of tasks? Our answer is OpenHands-Versa, a generalist agent built with a modest number of general tools: code editing and execution, web search, as well as multimodal web browsing and file access. Importantly, OpenHands-Versa demonstrates superior or competitive performance over leading specialized agents across three diverse and challenging benchmarks: SWE-Bench Multimodal, GAIA, and The Agent Company, outperforming the best-performing previously published results with absolute improvements in success rate of 9.1, 1.3, and 9.1 points respectively. Further, we show how existing state-of-the-art multi-agent systems fail to generalize beyond their target domains. These results demonstrate the feasibility of developing a generalist agent to solve diverse tasks and establish OpenHands-Versa as a strong baseline for future research.</p></details> |  |

To facilitate private learning with scarce data, Federated Learning has become a standard approach. However, it faces challenges such as computational resource heterogeneity and data heterogeneity among end users. We propose CoMiGS ($\textbf{Co}$llaborative learning with a $\textbf{Mi}$xture of $\textbf{G}$eneralists and $\textbf{S}$pecialists), the first approach to address both challenges. A key innovation of our method is the bi-level optimization formulation of the Mixture-of-Experts learning objective, where the router is optimized using a separate validation set to ensure alignment with the target distribution. We solve our objective with alternating minimization, for which we provide a theoretical analysis. Our method shares generalist experts across users while localizing a varying number of specialist experts, thereby adapting to users' computational resources and preserving privacy. Through extensive experiments, we show CoMiGS effectively balances general and personalized knowledge for each token generation. We demonstrate that CoMiGS remains robust against overfitting-due to the generalists' regularizing effect-while adapting to local data through specialist expertise. We open source our codebase for collaborative LLMs.</p></details> | Camera-ready version |

However, many existing frameworks depend heavily on manually predefined tools and workflows, which hinder their adaptability, scalability, and generalization across domains. In this work, we introduce Alita--a generalist agent designed with the principle of "Simplicity is the ultimate sophistication," enabling scalable agentic reasoning through minimal predefinition and maximal self-evolution. For minimal predefinition, Alita is equipped with only one component for direct problem-solving, making it much simpler and neater than previous approaches that relied heavily on hand-crafted, elaborate tools and workflows. This clean design enhances its potential to generalize to challenging questions, without being limited by tools. For Maximal self-evolution, we enable the creativity of Alita by providing a suite of general-purpose components to autonomously construct, refine, and reuse external capabilities by generating task-related model context protocols (MCPs) from open source, which contributes to scalable agentic reasoning. Notably, Alita achieves 75.15% pass@1 and 87.27% pass@3 accuracy, which is top-ranking among general-purpose agents, on the GAIA benchmark validation dataset, 74.00% and 52.00% pass@1, respectively, on Mathvista and PathVQA, outperforming many agent systems with far greater complexity.

| **[Mol-LLM: Multimodal Generalist Molecular LLM with Improved Graph Utilization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02810v2)** | 2025-05-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have led to models that tackle diverse molecular tasks, such as chemical reaction prediction and molecular property prediction. Large-scale molecular instruction-tuning datasets have enabled sequence-only (e.g., SMILES or SELFIES) generalist molecular LLMs, and researchers are now exploring multimodal approaches that incorporate molecular structural information for further gains. However, a genuinely multimodal, generalist LLM that covers a broad spectrum of molecular tasks has yet to be fully investigated. We observe that naive next token prediction training ignores graph-structural information, limiting an LLM's ability to exploit molecular graphs. To address this, we propose (i) Molecular structure Preference Optimization (MolPO), which facilitates graph usage by optimizing preferences between pairs of correct and perturbed molecular structures, and (ii) an advanced graph encoder with a tailored pre-training strategy to improve the effect of graph utilization by MolPO. Building on these contributions, we introduce Mol-LLM, the first multimodal generalist model that (a) handles a broad spectrum of molecular tasks among molecular LLMs, (b) explicitly leverages molecular-structure information, and (c) takes advantage of extensive instruction tuning. Mol-LLM attains state-of-the-art or comparable results across the most comprehensive molecular-LLM benchmark-even on out-of-distribution datasets for reaction and property prediction, where it surpasses prior generalist molecular LLMs by a large margin.</p></details> | 9 pages, 5 figures |
| **[GRoQ-LoCO: Generalist and Robot-agnostic Quadruped Locomotion Control using Offline Datasets](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10973v3)** | 2025-05-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in large-scale offline training have demonstrated the potential of generalist policy learning for complex robotic tasks. However, applying these principles to legged locomotion remains a challenge due to continuous dynamics and the need for real-time adaptation across diverse terrains and robot morphologies. In this work, we propose GRoQ-LoCO, a scalable, attention-based framework that learns a single generalist locomotion policy across multiple quadruped robots and terrains, relying solely on offline datasets. Our approach leverages expert demonstrations from two distinct locomotion behaviors - stair traversal (non-periodic gaits) and flat terrain traversal (periodic gaits) - collected across multiple quadruped robots, to train a generalist model that enables behavior fusion. Crucially, our framework operates solely on proprioceptive data from all robots without incorporating any robot-specific encodings. The policy is directly deployable on an Intel i7 nuc, producing low-latency control outputs without any test-time optimization. Our extensive experiments demonstrate zero-shot transfer across highly diverse quadruped robots and terrains, including hardware deployment on the Unitree Go1, a commercially available 12kg robot. Notably, we evaluate challenging cross-robot training setups where different locomotion skills are unevenly distributed across robots, yet observe successful transfer of both flat walking and stair traversal behaviors to all robots at test time. We also show preliminary walking on Stoch 5, a 70kg quadruped, on flat and outdoor terrains without requiring any fine tuning. These results demonstrate the potential of offline, data-driven learning to generalize locomotion across diverse quadruped morphologies and behaviors.</p></details> | <details><summary>18pag...</summary><p>18pages, 16figures, 6tables</p></details> |

Traditional IDC methods often rely on specialist models, which restrict their applicability across varied contexts. This paper introduces the OneDiff model, a novel generalist approach that utilizes a robust vision-language model architecture, integrating a siamese image encoder with a Visual Delta Module. This innovative configuration allows for the precise detection and articulation of fine-grained differences between image pairs. OneDiff is trained through a dual-phase strategy, encompassing Coupled Sample Training and multi-task learning across a diverse array of data types, supported by our newly developed DiffCap Dataset. This dataset merges real-world and synthetic data, enhancing the training process and bolstering the model's robustness. Extensive testing on diverse IDC benchmarks, such as Spot-the-Diff, Image-Editing-Request, and Birds-to-Words, shows that OneDiff consistently outperforms existing state-of-the-art models in accuracy and adaptability, achieving improvements of up to 97% CIDEr points in average. By setting a new benchmark in IDC, OneDiff paves the way for more versatile and effective applications in detecting and describing visual differences. The code, models, and data will be made publicly available.</p></details> |  |
| **[The One RING: a Robotic Indoor Navigation Generalist](https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14401v2)** | 2025-05-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modern robots vary significantly in shape, size, and sensor configurations used to perceive and interact with their environments. However, most navigation policies are embodiment-specific--a policy trained on one robot typically fails to generalize to another, even with minor changes in body size or camera viewpoint. As custom hardware becomes increasingly common, there is a growing need for a single policy that generalizes across embodiments, eliminating the need to retrain for each specific robot. In this paper, we introduce RING (Robotic Indoor Navigation Generalist), an embodiment-agnostic policy that turns any mobile robot into an effective indoor semantic navigator. Trained entirely in simulation, RING leverages large-scale randomization over robot embodiments to enable robust generalization to many real-world platforms. To support this, we augment the AI2-THOR simulator to instantiate robots with controllable configurations, varying in body size, rotation pivot point, and camera parameters. On the visual object-goal navigation task, RING achieves strong cross-embodiment (XE) generalization--72.1% average success rate across five simulated embodiments (a 16.7% absolute improvement on the Chores-S benchmark) and 78.9% across four real-world platforms, including Stretch RE-1, LoCoBot, and Unitree Go1--matching or even surpassing embodiment-specific policies. We further deploy RING on the RB-Y1 wheeled humanoid in a real-world kitchen environment, showcasing its out-of-the-box potential for mobile manipulation platforms.

Unlike existing approaches that either build intricate workflows around a single large model or only provide workflow modularity, our agent integrates tool-based and pure vision agents within a highly modular architecture, enabling different models to collaboratively solve decoupled tasks in a step-by-step manner. Our generality is demonstrated by our ability to evaluate not only pure vision-based real-world benchmarks (i.e., OSWorld), but also more general or tool-intensive benchmarks (e.g., GAIA and SWE-Bench). Specifically, we achieve $\mathbf{7.27\%}$ accuracy on OSWorld, higher than Claude-Computer-Use.

However, prompting-based methods often remain shallow and unstable, while fine-tuned medical LLMs suffer from poor generalization under distribution shifts and limited adaptability to unseen clinical scenarios. To address these limitations, we present TAGS, a test-time framework that combines a broadly capable generalist with a domain-specific specialist to offer complementary perspectives without any model fine-tuning or parameter updates. To support this generalist-specialist reasoning process, we introduce two auxiliary modules: a hierarchical retrieval mechanism that provides multi-scale exemplars by selecting examples based on both semantic and rationale-level similarity, and a reliability scorer that evaluates reasoning consistency to guide final answer aggregation. TAGS achieves strong performance across nine MedQA benchmarks, boosting GPT-4o accuracy by 13.8%, DeepSeek-R1 by 16.8%, and improving a vanilla 7B model from 14.1% to 23.9%. These results surpass several fine-tuned medical LLMs, without any parameter updates.

For this reason, online HD map construction methods use live sensor data to infer map information instead. Research on real map changes shows that oftentimes entire parts of an HD map remain unchanged and can be used as a prior. We therefore introduce M3TR (Multi-Masking Map Transformer), a generalist approach for HD map completion both with and without offline HD map priors. As a necessary foundation, we address shortcomings in ground truth labels for Argoverse 2 and nuScenes and propose the first comprehensive benchmark for HD map completion. Unlike existing models that specialize in a single kind of map change, which is unrealistic for deployment, our Generalist model handles all kinds of changes, matching the effectiveness of Expert models. With our map masking as augmentation regime, we can even achieve a +1.4 mAP improvement without a prior. Finally, by fully utilizing prior HD map elements and optimizing query designs, M3TR outperforms existing methods by +4.3 mAP while being the first real-world deployable model for offline HD map priors.

This paper aims to build a Super-Aligned and GEneralist DRiving agent, SAGE DeeR. Sage Deer achieves three highlights: (1) Super alignment: It achieves different reactions according to different people's preferences and biases. (2) Generalist: It can understand the multi-view and multi-mode inputs to reason the user's physiological indicators, facial emotions, hand movements, body movements, driving scenarios, and behavioral decisions. (3) Self-Eliciting: It can elicit implicit thought chains in the language space to further increase generalist and super-aligned abilities. Besides, we collected multiple data sets and built a large-scale benchmark. This benchmark measures the deer's perceptual decision-making ability and the super alignment's accuracy.</p></details> |  |
| **[DGSolver: Diffusion Generalist Solver with Universal Posterior Sampling for Image Restoration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21487v2)** | 2025-05-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models have achieved remarkable progress in universal image restoration. While existing methods speed up inference by reducing sampling steps, substantial step intervals often introduce cumulative errors. Moreover, they struggle to balance the commonality of degradation representations and restoration quality. To address these challenges, we introduce \textbf{DGSolver}, a diffusion generalist solver with universal posterior sampling. We first derive the exact ordinary differential equations for generalist diffusion models and tailor high-order solvers with a queue-based accelerated sampling strategy to improve both accuracy and efficiency. We then integrate universal posterior sampling to better approximate manifold-constrained gradients, yielding a more accurate noise estimation and correcting errors in inverse inference. Extensive experiments show that DGSolver outperforms state-of-the-art methods in restoration accuracy, stability, and scalability, both qualitatively and quantitatively. Code and models will be available at https://github.com/MiliLab/DGSolver.</p></details> |  |
| **[On Path to Multimodal Generalist: General-Level and General-Bench](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04620v1)** | 2025-05-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) is currently experiencing rapid growth, driven by the advanced capabilities of LLMs. Unlike earlier specialists, existing MLLMs are evolving towards a Multimodal Generalist paradigm. Initially limited to understanding multiple modalities, these models have advanced to not only comprehend but also generate across modalities. Their capabilities have expanded from coarse-grained to fine-grained multimodal understanding and from supporting limited modalities to arbitrary ones. While many benchmarks exist to assess MLLMs, a critical question arises: Can we simply assume that higher performance across tasks indicates a stronger MLLM capability, bringing us closer to human-level AI? We argue that the answer is not as straightforward as it seems. This project introduces General-Level, an evaluation framework that defines 5-scale levels of MLLM performance and generality, offering a methodology to compare MLLMs and gauge the progress of existing systems towards more robust multimodal generalists and, ultimately, towards AGI. At the core of the framework is the concept of Synergy, which measures whether models maintain consistent capabilities across comprehension and generation, and across multiple modalities. To support this evaluation, we present General-Bench, which encompasses a broader spectrum of skills, modalities, formats, and capabilities, including over 700 tasks and 325,800 instances. The evaluation results that involve over 100 existing state-of-the-art MLLMs uncover the capability rankings of generalists, highlighting the challenges in reaching genuine AI. We expect this project to pave the way for future research on next-generation multimodal foundation models, providing a robust infrastructure to accelerate the realization of AGI.

Previous vision encoders, typically pre-trained with single-image reconstruction or two-image contrastive learning, tend to capture static information, often neglecting the dynamic aspects vital for embodied tasks. Recently, video diffusion models (VDMs) demonstrate the ability to predict future frames and showcase a strong understanding of physical world. We hypothesize that VDMs inherently produce visual representations that encompass both current static information and predicted future dynamics, thereby providing valuable guidance for robot action learning. Based on this hypothesis, we propose the Video Prediction Policy (VPP), which learns implicit inverse dynamics model conditioned on predicted future representations inside VDMs. To predict more precise future, we fine-tune pre-trained video foundation model on robot datasets along with internet human manipulation data. In experiments, VPP achieves a 18.6\% relative improvement on the Calvin ABC-D generalization benchmark compared to the previous state-of-the-art, and demonstrates a 31.6\% increase in success rates for complex real-world dexterous manipulation tasks.

Motion generation models focus on creating diverse, realistic motions from inputs like text, audio, or keyframes, while motion estimation models aim to reconstruct accurate motion trajectories from observations like videos. Despite sharing underlying representations of temporal dynamics and kinematics, this separation limits knowledge transfer between tasks and requires maintaining separate models. We present GENMO, a unified Generalist Model for Human Motion that bridges motion estimation and generation in a single framework. Our key insight is to reformulate motion estimation as constrained motion generation, where the output motion must precisely satisfy observed conditioning signals. Leveraging the synergy between regression and diffusion, GENMO achieves accurate global motion estimation while enabling diverse motion generation. We also introduce an estimation-guided training objective that exploits in-the-wild videos with 2D annotations and text descriptions to enhance generative diversity. Furthermore, our novel architecture handles variable-length motions and mixed multimodal conditions (text, audio, video) at different time intervals, offering flexible control. This unified approach creates synergistic benefits: generative priors improve estimated motions under challenging conditions like occlusions, while diverse video data enhances generation capabilities. Extensive experiments demonstrate GENMO's effectiveness as a generalist framework that successfully handles multiple human motion tasks within a single model.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://research.nvidia.com/labs/dair/genmo/</p></details> |

Building on this, various methods further fine-tune the pre-trained T2I model for specific tasks. However, this requires separate model architectures, training designs, and multiple parameter sets to handle different tasks. In this paper, we introduce UniVG, a generalist diffusion model capable of supporting a diverse range of image generation tasks with a single set of weights. UniVG treats multi-modal inputs as unified conditions to enable various downstream applications, ranging from T2I generation, inpainting, instruction-based editing, identity-preserving generation, and layout-guided generation, to depth estimation and referring segmentation. Through comprehensive empirical studies on data mixing and multi-task training, we provide detailed insights into the training processes and decisions that inform our final designs. For example, we show that T2I generation and other tasks, such as instruction-based editing, can coexist without performance trade-offs, while auxiliary tasks like depth estimation and referring segmentation enhance image editing. Notably, our model can even outperform some task-specific models on their respective benchmarks, marking a significant step towards a unified image generation model.</p></details> |  |

However, acquiring such high-quality trajectory data typically demands meticulous supervision from humans or superior models, which can be either expensive or license-constrained. In this paper, we explore how far an LLM can improve its reasoning by self-synthesizing reasoning paths as training data without any additional supervision. Existing self-synthesizing methods, such as STaR, suffer from poor generalization to out-of-domain (OOD) reasoning tasks. We hypothesize it is due to that their self-synthesized reasoning paths are too task-specific, lacking general task-agnostic reasoning guidance. To address this, we propose Reasoning Generalist via Self-Improvement (ReGenesis), a method to self-synthesize reasoning paths as post-training data by progressing from abstract to concrete. More specifically, ReGenesis self-synthesizes reasoning paths by converting general reasoning guidelines into task-specific ones, generating reasoning structures, and subsequently transforming these structures into reasoning paths, without the need for human-designed task-specific examples used in existing methods. We show that ReGenesis achieves superior performance on all in-domain and OOD settings tested compared to existing methods. For six OOD tasks specifically, while previous methods exhibited an average performance decrease of approximately 4.6% after post training, ReGenesis delivers around 6.1% performance improvement. We also conduct in-depth analysis of our framework and show ReGenesis is effective across various LLMs and design choices.</p></details> |  |

| **[Enhancing Multi-task Learning Capability of Medical Generalist Foundation Model via Image-centric Multi-annotation Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09967v1)** | 2025-04-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The emergence of medical generalist foundation models has revolutionized conventional task-specific model development paradigms, aiming to better handle multiple tasks through joint training on large-scale medical datasets. However, recent advances prioritize simple data scaling or architectural component enhancement, while neglecting to re-examine multi-task learning from a data-centric perspective. Critically, simply aggregating existing data resources leads to decentralized image-task alignment, which fails to cultivate comprehensive image understanding or align with clinical needs for multi-dimensional image interpretation. In this paper, we introduce the image-centric multi-annotation X-ray dataset (IMAX), the first attempt to enhance the multi-task learning capabilities of medical multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) from the data construction level. To be specific, IMAX is featured from the following attributes: 1) High-quality data curation. A comprehensive collection of more than 354K entries applicable to seven different medical tasks. 2) Image-centric dense annotation. Each X-ray image is associated with an average of 4.10 tasks and 7.46 training entries, ensuring multi-task representation richness per image. Compared to the general decentralized multi-annotation X-ray dataset (DMAX), IMAX consistently demonstrates significant multi-task average performance gains ranging from 3.20% to 21.05% across seven open-source state-of-the-art medical MLLMs. Moreover, we investigate differences in statistical patterns exhibited by IMAX and DMAX training processes, exploring potential correlations between optimization dynamics and multi-task performance. Finally, leveraging the core concept of IMAX data construction, we propose an optimized DMAX-based training strategy to alleviate the dilemma of obtaining high-quality IMAX data in practical scenarios.</p></details> |  |
| **[AutoEval: Autonomous Evaluation of Generalist Robot Manipulation Policies in the Real World](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24278v2)** | 2025-04-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Scalable and reproducible policy evaluation has been a long-standing challenge in robot learning. Evaluations are critical to assess progress and build better policies, but evaluation in the real world, especially at a scale that would provide statistically reliable results, is costly in terms of human time and hard to obtain. Evaluation of increasingly generalist robot policies requires an increasingly diverse repertoire of evaluation environments, making the evaluation bottleneck even more pronounced. To make real-world evaluation of robotic policies more practical, we propose AutoEval, a system to autonomously evaluate generalist robot policies around the clock with minimal human intervention. Users interact with AutoEval by submitting evaluation jobs to the AutoEval queue, much like how software jobs are submitted with a cluster scheduling system, and AutoEval will schedule the policies for evaluation within a framework supplying automatic success detection and automatic scene resets. We show that AutoEval can nearly fully eliminate human involvement in the evaluation process, permitting around the clock evaluations, and the evaluation results correspond closely to ground truth evaluations conducted by hand. To facilitate the evaluation of generalist policies in the robotics community, we provide public access to multiple AutoEval scenes in the popular BridgeData robot setup with WidowX robot arms. In the future, we hope that AutoEval scenes can be set up across institutions to form a diverse and distributed evaluation network.</p></details> |  |

However, current agents face significant challenges: imprecise grounding of GUI elements, difficulties with long-horizon task planning, and performance bottlenecks from relying on single generalist models for diverse cognitive tasks. To this end, we introduce Agent S2, a novel compositional framework that delegates cognitive responsibilities across various generalist and specialist models. We propose a novel Mixture-of-Grounding technique to achieve precise GUI localization and introduce Proactive Hierarchical Planning, dynamically refining action plans at multiple temporal scales in response to evolving observations. Evaluations demonstrate that Agent S2 establishes new state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on three prominent computer use benchmarks. Specifically, Agent S2 achieves 18.9% and 32.7% relative improvements over leading baseline agents such as Claude Computer Use and UI-TARS on the OSWorld 15-step and 50-step evaluation. Moreover, Agent S2 generalizes effectively to other operating systems and applications, surpassing previous best methods by 52.8% on WindowsAgentArena and by 16.52% on AndroidWorld relatively.

| **[Balancing Multi-Target Semi-Supervised Medical Image Segmentation with Collaborative Generalist and Specialists](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00862v1)** | 2025-04-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite the promising performance achieved by current semi-supervised models in segmenting individual medical targets, many of these models suffer a notable decrease in performance when tasked with the simultaneous segmentation of multiple targets. A vital factor could be attributed to the imbalanced scales among different targets: during simultaneously segmenting multiple targets, large targets dominate the loss, leading to small targets being misclassified as larger ones. To this end, we propose a novel method, which consists of a Collaborative Generalist and several Specialists, termed CGS. It is centered around the idea of employing a specialist for each target class, thus avoiding the dominance of larger targets. The generalist performs conventional multi-target segmentation, while each specialist is dedicated to distinguishing a specific target class from the remaining target classes and the background. Based on a theoretical insight, we demonstrate that CGS can achieve a more balanced training. Moreover, we develop cross-consistency losses to foster collaborative learning between the generalist and the specialists. Lastly, regarding their intrinsic relation that the target class of any specialized head should belong to the remaining classes of the other heads, we introduce an inter-head error detection module to further enhance the quality of pseudo-labels. Experimental results on three popular benchmarks showcase its superior performance compared to state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[RIG: Synergizing Reasoning and Imagination in End-to-End Generalist Policy](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24388v1)** | 2025-03-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reasoning before action and imagining potential outcomes (i.e., world models) are essential for embodied agents operating in complex open-world environments. Yet, prior work either incorporates only one of these abilities in an end-to-end agent or integrates multiple specialized models into an agent system, limiting the learning efficiency and generalization of the policy. Thus, this paper makes the first attempt to synergize Reasoning and Imagination in an end-to-end Generalist policy, termed RIG. To train RIG in an end-to-end manner, we construct a data pipeline that progressively integrates and enriches the content of imagination and reasoning in the trajectories collected from existing agents. The joint learning of reasoning and next image generation explicitly models the inherent correlation between reasoning, action, and dynamics of environments, and thus exhibits more than $17\times$ sample efficiency improvements and generalization in comparison with previous works. During inference, RIG first reasons about the next action, produces potential action, and then predicts the action outcomes, which offers the agent a chance to review and self-correct based on the imagination before taking real actions. Experimental results show that the synergy of reasoning and imagination not only improves the robustness, generalization, and interoperability of generalist policy but also enables test-time scaling to enhance overall performance.</p></details> |  |

Recent advancements in humanoid robots have shown great promise as a hardware platform for building generalist autonomy in the human world. A robot foundation model, trained on massive and diverse data sources, is essential for enabling the robots to reason about novel situations, robustly handle real-world variability, and rapidly learn new tasks. To this end, we introduce GR00T N1, an open foundation model for humanoid robots. GR00T N1 is a Vision-Language-Action (VLA) model with a dual-system architecture.

The subsequent diffusion transformer module (System 1) generates fluid motor actions in real time. Both modules are tightly coupled and jointly trained end-to-end.

We show that our generalist robot model GR00T N1 outperforms the state-of-the-art imitation learning baselines on standard simulation benchmarks across multiple robot embodiments. Furthermore, we deploy our model on the Fourier GR-1 humanoid robot for language-conditioned bimanual manipulation tasks, achieving strong performance with high data efficiency.</p></details> | <details><summary>Autho...</summary><p>Authors are listed alphabetically.

| **[A Generalist Hanabi Agent](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14555v1)** | 2025-03-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Traditional multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) systems can develop cooperative strategies through repeated interactions. However, these systems are unable to perform well on any other setting than the one they have been trained on, and struggle to successfully cooperate with unfamiliar collaborators. This is particularly visible in the Hanabi benchmark, a popular 2-to-5 player cooperative card-game which requires complex reasoning and precise assistance to other agents. Current MARL agents for Hanabi can only learn one specific game-setting (e.g., 2-player games), and play with the same algorithmic agents. This is in stark contrast to humans, who can quickly adjust their strategies to work with unfamiliar partners or situations. In this paper, we introduce Recurrent Replay Relevance Distributed DQN (R3D2), a generalist agent for Hanabi, designed to overcome these limitations. We reformulate the task using text, as language has been shown to improve transfer. We then propose a distributed MARL algorithm that copes with the resulting dynamic observation- and action-space. In doing so, our agent is the first that can play all game settings concurrently, and extend strategies learned from one setting to other ones. As a consequence, our agent also demonstrates the ability to collaborate with different algorithmic agents -- agents that are themselves unable to do so.

However, web tasks, such as booking flights, usually involve users' PII, which may be exposed to potential privacy risks if web agents accidentally interact with compromised websites, a scenario that remains largely unexplored in the literature. In this work, we narrow this gap by conducting the first study on the privacy risks of generalist web agents in adversarial environments. First, we present a realistic threat model for attacks on the website, where we consider two adversarial targets: stealing users' specific PII or the entire user request. Then, we propose a novel attack method, termed Environmental Injection Attack (EIA). EIA injects malicious content designed to adapt well to environments where the agents operate and our work instantiates EIA specifically for privacy scenarios in web environments. We collect 177 action steps that involve diverse PII categories on realistic websites from the Mind2Web, and conduct experiments using one of the most capable generalist web agent frameworks to date. The results demonstrate that EIA achieves up to 70% ASR in stealing specific PII and 16% ASR for full user request. Additionally, by accessing the stealthiness and experimenting with a defensive system prompt, we indicate that EIA is hard to detect and mitigate. Notably, attacks that are not well adapted for a webpage can be detected via human inspection, leading to our discussion about the trade-off between security and autonomy. However, extra attackers' efforts can make EIA seamlessly adapted, rendering such supervision ineffective. Thus, we further discuss the defenses at the pre- and post-deployment stages of the websites without relying on human supervision and call for more advanced defense strategies.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICLR 2025</p></details> |

We propose a simple generalist framework based on a deep encoder - shallow decoder architecture with per-pixel prediction. Essentially fine-tuning a massively pretrained image model with minimal additional components. Naively this method does not yield good results. We show that this is due to imbalance during training and propose a novel method for reducing it - centroid regression in the space of spectral positional embeddings. Our method achieves panoptic quality (PQ) of 55.1 on the challenging MS-COCO dataset, state-of-the-art performance among generalist methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[GOAL: A Generalist Combinatorial Optimization Agent Learner](https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15079v3)** | 2025-02-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Machine Learning-based heuristics have recently shown impressive performance in solving a variety of hard combinatorial optimization problems (COPs). However, they generally rely on a separate neural model, specialized and trained for each single problem. Any variation of a problem requires adjustment of its model and re-training from scratch. In this paper, we propose GOAL (for Generalist combinatorial Optimization Agent Learner), a generalist model capable of efficiently solving multiple COPs and which can be fine-tuned to solve new COPs. GOAL consists of a single backbone plus light-weight problem-specific adapters for input and output processing. The backbone is based on a new form of mixed-attention blocks which allows to handle problems defined on graphs with arbitrary combinations of node, edge and instance-level features. Additionally, problems which involve heterogeneous types of nodes or edges are handled through a novel multi-type transformer architecture, where the attention blocks are duplicated to attend the meaningful combinations of types while relying on the same shared parameters. We train GOAL on a set of routing, scheduling and classic graph problems and show that it is only slightly inferior to the specialized baselines while being the first multi-task model that solves a wide range of COPs. Finally we showcase the strong transfer learning capacity of GOAL by fine-tuning it on several new problems.

In this work, we introduce NV-Embed, incorporating architectural designs, training procedures, and curated datasets to significantly enhance the performance of LLM as a versatile embedding model, while maintaining its simplicity and reproducibility. For model architecture, we propose a latent attention layer to obtain pooled embeddings, which consistently improves retrieval and downstream task accuracy compared to mean pooling or using the last <EOS> token embedding from LLMs. To enhance representation learning, we remove the causal attention mask of LLMs during contrastive training. For training algorithm, we introduce a two-stage contrastive instruction-tuning method. It first applies contrastive training with instructions on retrieval datasets, utilizing in-batch negatives and curated hard negative examples. At stage-2, it blends various non-retrieval into instruction tuning, which not only enhances non-retrieval task accuracy but also improves retrieval performance. For training data, we utilize the hard-negative mining, synthetic data generation and existing public available datasets to boost the performance of embedding model. By combining these techniques, our NV-Embed-v1 and NV-Embed-v2 models obtained the No.1 position on the MTEB leaderboard (as of May 24 and August 30, 2024, respectively) across 56 tasks, demonstrating the sustained effectiveness of the proposed methods over time. It also achieved the highest scores in the Long Doc section and the second-highest scores in the QA section of the AIR Benchmark, which covers a range of out-of-domain information retrieval topics beyond those in MTEB. We further provide the analysis of model compression techniques for generalist embedding models.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICLR ...</summary><p>ICLR 2025 (Spotlight).

However, the data that such policies are trained on is generally of mixed quality -- not only are human-collected demonstrations unlikely to perform the task perfectly, but the larger the dataset is, the harder it is to curate only the highest quality examples. It also remains unclear how optimal data from one embodiment is for training on another embodiment. In this paper, we present a general and broadly applicable approach that enhances the performance of such generalist robot policies at deployment time by re-ranking their actions according to a value function learned via offline RL. This approach, which we call Value-Guided Policy Steering (V-GPS), is compatible with a wide range of different generalist policies, without needing to fine-tune or even access the weights of the policy. We show that the same value function can improve the performance of five different state-of-the-art policies with different architectures, even though they were trained on distinct datasets, attaining consistent performance improvement on multiple robotic platforms across a total of 12 tasks.

Is scaling current agent architectures the most effective way to build generalist agents? We propose a novel approach to pre-train relatively small policies on relatively small datasets and adapt them to unseen environments via in-context learning, without any finetuning. Our key idea is that retrieval offers a powerful bias for fast adaptation. Indeed, we demonstrate that even a simple retrieval-based 1-nearest neighbor agent offers a surprisingly strong baseline for today's state-of-the-art generalist agents. From this starting point, we construct a semi-parametric agent, REGENT, that trains a transformer-based policy on sequences of queries and retrieved neighbors. REGENT can generalize to unseen robotics and game-playing environments via retrieval augmentation and in-context learning, achieving this with up to 3x fewer parameters and up to an order-of-magnitude fewer pre-training datapoints, significantly outperforming today's state-of-the-art generalist agents.

| **[Efficient Multi-Task Learning via Generalist Recommender](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05318v1)** | 2025-02-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-task learning (MTL) is a common machine learning technique that allows the model to share information across different tasks and improve the accuracy of recommendations for all of them. Many existing MTL implementations suffer from scalability issues as the training and inference performance can degrade with the increasing number of tasks, which can limit production use case scenarios for MTL-based recommender systems. Inspired by the recent advances of large language models, we developed an end-to-end efficient and scalable Generalist Recommender (GRec). GRec takes comprehensive data signals by utilizing NLP heads, parallel Transformers, as well as a wide and deep structure to process multi-modal inputs. These inputs are then combined and fed through a newly proposed task-sentence level routing mechanism to scale the model capabilities on multiple tasks without compromising performance. Offline evaluations and online experiments show that GRec significantly outperforms our previous recommender solutions. GRec has been successfully deployed on one of the largest telecom websites and apps, effectively managing high volumes of online traffic every day.</p></details> |  |
| **[BTS: Harmonizing Specialized Experts into a Generalist LLM](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00075v1)** | 2025-01-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present Branch-Train-Stitch (BTS), an efficient and flexible training algorithm for combining independently trained large language model (LLM) experts into a single, capable generalist model. Following Li et al., we start with a single seed language model which is branched into domain-specific (e.g., coding or math) experts with continual pretraining. BTS combines experts into a generalist model using lightweight stitch layers, which are inserted between frozen experts and the seed LLM, and trained on a small datamix of the expert domains. Stitch layers enable the seed LLM to integrate representations from any number of experts during the forward pass, allowing it to generalize to new domains, despite remaining frozen. Because BTS does not alter the constituent LLMs, BTS provides a modular and flexible approach: experts can be easily removed and new experts can be added with only a small amount of training. Compared to alternative model merging approaches, BTS yields the best generalist performance on a variety of downstream tasks, retaining the specialized capabilities of each of the experts.</p></details> |  |
| **[Beyond Sight: Finetuning Generalist Robot Policies with Heterogeneous Sensors via Language Grounding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04693v3)** | 2025-01-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Interacting with the world is a multi-sensory experience: achieving effective general-purpose interaction requires making use of all available modalities -- including vision, touch, and audio -- to fill in gaps from partial observation. For example, when vision is occluded reaching into a bag, a robot should rely on its senses of touch and sound. However, state-of-the-art generalist robot policies are typically trained on large datasets to predict robot actions solely from visual and proprioceptive observations. In this work, we propose FuSe, a novel approach that enables finetuning visuomotor generalist policies on heterogeneous sensor modalities for which large datasets are not readily available by leveraging natural language as a common cross-modal grounding. We combine a multimodal contrastive loss with a sensory-grounded language generation loss to encode high-level semantics. In the context of robot manipulation, we show that FuSe enables performing challenging tasks that require reasoning jointly over modalities such as vision, touch, and sound in a zero-shot setting, such as multimodal prompting, compositional cross-modal prompting, and descriptions of objects it interacts with. We show that the same recipe is applicable to widely different generalist policies, including both diffusion-based generalist policies and large vision-language-action (VLA) models. Extensive experiments in the real world show that FuSeis able to increase success rates by over 20% compared to all considered baselines.</p></details> |  |

Unlike copilot systems, which primarily rely on users to provide essential state information (e.g., task descriptions) and assist users by answering questions or auto-completing contents, autopilot systems must complete tasks from start to finish independently, which requires the system to acquire the state information from the environments actively. To achieve this, an autopilot system should be capable of understanding user intents, actively gathering necessary information from various real-world sources, and making wise decisions. Cognitive Kernel adopts a model-centric design. In our implementation, the central policy model (a fine-tuned LLM) initiates interactions with the environment using a combination of atomic actions, such as opening files, clicking buttons, saving intermediate results to memory, or calling the LLM itself. This differs from the widely used environment-centric design, where a task-specific environment with predefined actions is fixed, and the policy model is limited to selecting the correct action from a given set of options. Our design facilitates seamless information flow across various sources and provides greater flexibility. We evaluate our system in three use cases: real-time information management, private information management, and long-term memory management. The results demonstrate that Cognitive Kernel achieves better or comparable performance to other closed-source systems in these scenarios. Cognitive Kernel is fully dockerized, ensuring everyone can deploy it privately and securely. We open-source the system and the backbone model to encourage further research on LLM-driven autopilot systems.</p></details> |  |

Unlike traditional MLLMs limited to text output, VisionLLM v2 significantly broadens its application scope. It excels not only in conventional visual question answering (VQA) but also in open-ended, cross-domain vision tasks such as object localization, pose estimation, and image generation and editing. To this end, we propose a new information transmission mechanism termed "super link", as a medium to connect MLLM with task-specific decoders. It not only allows flexible transmission of task information and gradient feedback between the MLLM and multiple downstream decoders but also effectively resolves training conflicts in multi-tasking scenarios. In addition, to support the diverse range of tasks, we carefully collected and combed training data from hundreds of public vision and vision-language tasks. In this way, our model can be joint-trained end-to-end on hundreds of vision language tasks and generalize to these tasks using a set of shared parameters through different user prompts, achieving performance comparable to task-specific models. We believe VisionLLM v2 will offer a new perspective on the generalization of MLLMs.</p></details> | 44 pages |
| **[ARC: A Generalist Graph Anomaly Detector with In-Context Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16771v2)** | 2024-12-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph anomaly detection (GAD), which aims to identify abnormal nodes that differ from the majority within a graph, has garnered significant attention. However, current GAD methods necessitate training specific to each dataset, resulting in high training costs, substantial data requirements, and limited generalizability when being applied to new datasets and domains. To address these limitations, this paper proposes ARC, a generalist GAD approach that enables a ``one-for-all'' GAD model to detect anomalies across various graph datasets on-the-fly. Equipped with in-context learning, ARC can directly extract dataset-specific patterns from the target dataset using few-shot normal samples at the inference stage, without the need for retraining or fine-tuning on the target dataset. ARC comprises three components that are well-crafted for capturing universal graph anomaly patterns: 1) smoothness-based feature Alignment module that unifies the features of different datasets into a common and anomaly-sensitive space; 2) ego-neighbor Residual graph encoder that learns abnormality-related node embeddings; and 3) cross-attentive in-Context anomaly scoring module that predicts node abnormality by leveraging few-shot normal samples. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets from various domains demonstrate the superior anomaly detection performance, efficiency, and generalizability of ARC.</p></details> | 25 pages, 10 figures |

However, constructing a data-efficient generalist for dense visual prediction presents a distinct challenge due to the variation in label structures across different tasks. Consequently, generalization to unseen dense prediction tasks in the low-data regime is not straightforward and has received less attention from previous vision generalists. In this study, we explore a universal model that can flexibly adapt to unseen dense label structures with a few examples, enabling it to serve as a data-efficient vision generalist in diverse real-world scenarios. To this end, we base our method on a powerful meta-learning framework and explore several axes to improve its performance and versatility for real-world problems, such as flexible adaptation mechanisms and scalability. We evaluate our model across a spectrum of unseen real-world scenarios where low-shot learning is desirable, including video, 3D, medical, biological, and user-interactive tasks. Equipped with a generic architecture and an effective adaptation mechanism, our model flexibly adapts to all of these tasks with at most 50 labeled images, showcasing a significant advancement over existing data-efficient generalist approaches.

While these models show impressive flexibility, their performance heavily depends on the quality of their training data. In this work, we propose Reinforcement Learning Distilled Generalists (RLDG), a method that leverages reinforcement learning to generate high-quality training data for finetuning generalist policies. Through extensive real-world experiments on precise manipulation tasks like connector insertion and assembly, we demonstrate that generalist policies trained with RL-generated data consistently outperform those trained with human demonstrations, achieving up to 40% higher success rates while generalizing better to new tasks. We also provide a detailed analysis that reveals this performance gain stems from both optimized action distributions and improved state coverage. Our results suggest that combining task-specific RL with generalist policy distillation offers a promising approach for developing more capable and efficient robotic manipulation systems that maintain the flexibility of foundation models while achieving the performance of specialized controllers.

Specifically, our focus lies in areas such as Embodied AI, Games, UI Control, and Planning. To this end, we introduce a process of adapting an MLLM to a Generalist Embodied Agent (GEA). GEA is a single unified model capable of grounding itself across these varied domains through a multi-embodiment action tokenizer. GEA is trained with supervised learning on a large dataset of embodied experiences and with online RL in interactive simulators. We explore the data and algorithmic choices necessary to develop such a model. Our findings reveal the importance of training with cross-domain data and online RL for building generalist agents. The final GEA model achieves strong generalization performance to unseen tasks across diverse benchmarks compared to other generalist models and benchmark-specific approaches.</p></details> |  |

Existing data-driven models focus on single weather understanding tasks (e.g., weather forecasting). Although these models have achieved promising results, they fail to tackle various complex tasks within a single and unified model. Moreover, the paradigm that relies on limited real observations for a single scenario hinders the model's performance upper bound. In response to these limitations, we draw inspiration from the in-context learning paradigm employed in state-of-the-art visual foundation models and large language models. In this paper, we introduce the first generalist weather foundation model (WeatherGFM), designed to address a wide spectrum of weather understanding tasks in a unified manner. More specifically, we initially unify the representation and definition of the diverse weather understanding tasks. Subsequently, we devised weather prompt formats to manage different weather data modalities, namely single, multiple, and temporal modalities. Finally, we adopt a visual prompting question-answering paradigm for the training of unified weather understanding tasks. Extensive experiments indicate that our WeatherGFM can effectively handle up to ten weather understanding tasks, including weather forecasting, super-resolution, weather image translation, and post-processing. Our method also showcases generalization ability on unseen tasks.</p></details> |  |

This multi-task learning capability is significantly important for generalist agents, where adaptation features are highly required (e.g., autonomous robots). On the other hand, Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) have emerged as alternative energy-efficient neural network algorithms due to their sparse spike-based operations. Toward this, we propose MTSpark, a novel methodology to enable multi-task RL using spiking networks. Specifically, MTSpark develops a Deep Spiking Q-Network (DSQN) with active dendrites and dueling structure by leveraging task-specific context signals. Specifically, each neuron computes task-dependent activations that dynamically modulate inputs, forming specialized sub-networks for each task. Moreover, this bioplausible network model also benefits from SNNs, enhancing energy efficiency and making the model suitable for hardware implementation. Experimental results show that, our MTSpark effectively learns multiple tasks with higher performance compared to the state-of-the-art. Specifically, MTSpark successfully achieves high score in three Atari games (i.e., Pong: -5.4, Breakout: 0.6, and Enduro: 371.2), reaching human-level performance (i.e., Pong: -3, Breakout: 31, and Enduro: 368), where state-of-the-art struggle to achieve. In addition, our MTSpark also shows better accuracy in image classification tasks than the state-of-the-art. These results highlight the potential of our MTSpark methodology to develop generalist agents that can learn multiple tasks by leveraging both RL and SNN concepts.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 10 figures, 5 tables</p></details> |

This survey delves into the evolution of GVAs, tracing their progress from early intelligent assistants to contemporary implementations that incorporate large-scale models. We explore both the philosophical underpinnings and practical foundations of GVAs, addressing their developmental challenges and the methodologies currently employed in their design and operation. By presenting a detailed taxonomy of GVA environments, tasks, and capabilities, this paper aims to bridge the theoretical and practical aspects of GVAs, concluding those that operate in environments closely mirroring the real world are more likely to demonstrate human-like intelligence. We discuss potential future directions for GVA research, highlighting the necessity for realistic evaluation metrics and the enhancement of long-sequence decision-making capabilities to advance the field toward more systematic or embodied applications.

| **[GSL-PCD: Improving Generalist-Specialist Learning with Point Cloud Feature-based Task Partitioning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06733v1)** | 2024-11-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generalization in Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) across unseen environment variations often requires training over a diverse set of scenarios. Many existing DRL algorithms struggle with efficiency when handling numerous variations. The Generalist-Specialist Learning (GSL) framework addresses this by first training a generalist model on all variations, then creating specialists from the generalist's weights, each focusing on a subset of variations. The generalist then refines its learning with assistance from the specialists. However, random task partitioning in GSL can impede performance by assigning vastly different variations to the same specialist, often resulting in each specialist focusing on only one variation, which raises computational costs. To improve this, we propose Generalist-Specialist Learning with Point Cloud Feature-based Task Partitioning (GSL-PCD). Our approach clusters environment variations based on features extracted from object point clouds and uses balanced clustering with a greedy algorithm to assign similar variations to the same specialist. Evaluations on robotic manipulation tasks from the ManiSkill benchmark demonstrate that point cloud feature-based partitioning outperforms vanilla partitioning by 9.4%, with a fixed number of specialists, and reduces computational and sample requirements by 50% to achieve comparable performance.</p></details> |  |

To achieve this vision, AI agents must effectively plan, perform multi-step reasoning and actions, respond to novel observations, and recover from errors, to successfully complete complex tasks across a wide range of scenarios. In this work, we introduce Magentic-One, a high-performing open-source agentic system for solving such tasks. Magentic-One uses a multi-agent architecture where a lead agent, the Orchestrator, plans, tracks progress, and re-plans to recover from errors. Throughout task execution, the Orchestrator directs other specialized agents to perform tasks as needed, such as operating a web browser, navigating local files, or writing and executing Python code. We show that Magentic-One achieves statistically competitive performance to the state-of-the-art on three diverse and challenging agentic benchmarks: GAIA, AssistantBench, and WebArena. Magentic-One achieves these results without modification to core agent capabilities or to how they collaborate, demonstrating progress towards generalist agentic systems. Moreover, Magentic-One's modular design allows agents to be added or removed from the team without additional prompt tuning or training, easing development and making it extensible to future scenarios. We provide an open-source implementation of Magentic-One, and we include AutoGenBench, a standalone tool for agentic evaluation. AutoGenBench provides built-in controls for repetition and isolation to run agentic benchmarks in a rigorous and contained manner -- which is important when agents' actions have side-effects. Magentic-One, AutoGenBench and detailed empirical performance evaluations of Magentic-One, including ablations and error analysis are available at https://aka.ms/magentic-one</p></details> |  |

In the field of medicine, while GFMs exhibit superior generalizability based on their extensive intrinsic knowledge as well as proficiency in instruction following and in-context learning, specialist models excel in precision due to their domain knowledge. In this work, for the first time, we explore the synergy between the GFM and specialist models, to enable precise medical image analysis on a broader scope. Specifically, we propose a cooperative framework, Generalist-Specialist Collaboration (GSCo), which consists of two stages, namely the construction of GFM and specialists, and collaborative inference on downstream tasks. In the construction stage, we develop MedDr, the largest open-source GFM tailored for medicine, showcasing exceptional instruction-following and in-context learning capabilities. Meanwhile, a series of lightweight specialists are crafted for downstream tasks with low computational cost. In the collaborative inference stage, we introduce two cooperative mechanisms, Mixture-of-Expert Diagnosis and Retrieval-Augmented Diagnosis, to harvest the generalist's in-context learning abilities alongside the specialists' domain expertise. For a comprehensive evaluation, we curate a large-scale benchmark featuring 28 datasets and about 250,000 images. Extensive results demonstrate that MedDr consistently outperforms state-of-the-art GFMs on downstream datasets. Furthermore, GSCo exceeds both GFMs and specialists across all out-of-domain disease diagnosis datasets. These findings indicate a significant paradigm shift in the application of GFMs, transitioning from separate models for specific tasks to a collaborative approach between GFMs and specialists, thereby advancing the frontiers of generalizable AI in medicine.</p></details> |  |

However, building a unified MLLM for multi-task learning in the medical field remains a thorny challenge. To mitigate the tug-of-war problem of multi-modal multi-task optimization in MLLMs, recent advances primarily focus on improving the LLM components, while neglecting the connector that bridges the gap between modalities. In this paper, we introduce Uni-Med, a novel medical generalist foundation model which consists of a universal visual feature extraction module, a connector mixture-of-experts (CMoE) module, and an LLM. Benefiting from the proposed CMoE that leverages a well-designed router with a mixture of projection experts at the connector, Uni-Med achieves efficient solution to the tug-of-war problem and can perform six different medical tasks including question answering, visual question answering, report generation, referring expression comprehension, referring expression generation and image classification. To the best of our knowledge, Uni-Med is the first effort to tackle multi-task interference at the connector in MLLMs. Extensive ablation experiments validate the effectiveness of introducing CMoE under any configuration, with up to an average 8% performance gains. We further provide interpretation analysis of the tug-of-war problem from the perspective of gradient optimization and parameter statistics. Compared to previous state-of-the-art medical MLLMs, Uni-Med achieves competitive or superior evaluation metrics on diverse tasks.

Recent advanced proprietary models such as GPT-4 and Gemini have achieved significant advancements in biomedicine, which have also raised privacy and security challenges. The construction of specialized generalists hinges largely on high-quality datasets, enhanced by techniques like supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning from human or AI feedback, and direct preference optimization. However, these leading technologies (e.g., preference learning) are still significantly limited in the open source community due to the scarcity of specialized data. In this paper, we present the UltraMedical collections, which consist of high-quality manual and synthetic datasets in the biomedicine domain, featuring preference annotations across multiple advanced LLMs. By utilizing these datasets, we fine-tune a suite of specialized medical models based on Llama-3 series, demonstrating breathtaking capabilities across various medical benchmarks. Moreover, we develop powerful reward models skilled in biomedical and general reward benchmark, enhancing further online preference learning within the biomedical LLM community.

However, existing agent methods exhibit deficiencies in their generalization and specialization capabilities, especially in handling open-ended computer tasks in real-world environments. Inspired by the rich functionality of the App store, we present AgentStore, a scalable platform designed to dynamically integrate heterogeneous agents for automating computer tasks. AgentStore empowers users to integrate third-party agents, allowing the system to continuously enrich its capabilities and adapt to rapidly evolving operating systems. Additionally, we propose a novel core \textbf{MetaAgent} with the \textbf{AgentToken} strategy to efficiently manage diverse agents and utilize their specialized and generalist abilities for both domain-specific and system-wide tasks. Extensive experiments on three challenging benchmarks demonstrate that AgentStore surpasses the limitations of previous systems with narrow capabilities, particularly achieving a significant improvement from 11.21\% to 23.85\% on the OSWorld benchmark, more than doubling the previous results. Comprehensive quantitative and qualitative results further demonstrate AgentStore's ability to enhance agent systems in both generalization and specialization, underscoring its potential for developing the specialized generalist computer assistant.

| **[Effective Tuning Strategies for Generalist Robot Manipulation Policies](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01220v1)** | 2024-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generalist robot manipulation policies (GMPs) have the potential to generalize across a wide range of tasks, devices, and environments. However, existing policies continue to struggle with out-of-distribution scenarios due to the inherent difficulty of collecting sufficient action data to cover extensively diverse domains. While fine-tuning offers a practical way to quickly adapt a GMPs to novel domains and tasks with limited samples, we observe that the performance of the resulting GMPs differs significantly with respect to the design choices of fine-tuning strategies. In this work, we first conduct an in-depth empirical study to investigate the effect of key factors in GMPs fine-tuning strategies, covering the action space, policy head, supervision signal and the choice of tunable parameters, where 2,500 rollouts are evaluated for a single configuration. We systematically discuss and summarize our findings and identify the key design choices, which we believe give a practical guideline for GMPs fine-tuning. We observe that in a low-data regime, with carefully chosen fine-tuning strategies, a GMPs significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art imitation learning algorithms. The results presented in this work establish a new baseline for future studies on fine-tuned GMPs, and provide a significant addition to the GMPs toolbox for the community.</p></details> |  |

For complex, cluttered scenes, motion planning approaches can often take minutes to produce a solution, while humans are able to accurately and safely reach any goal in seconds by leveraging their prior experience. We seek to do the same by applying data-driven learning at scale to the problem of motion planning. Our approach builds a large number of complex scenes in simulation, collects expert data from a motion planner, then distills it into a reactive generalist policy. We then combine this with lightweight optimization to obtain a safe path for real world deployment. We perform a thorough evaluation of our method on 64 motion planning tasks across four diverse environments with randomized poses, scenes and obstacles, in the real world, demonstrating an improvement of 23%, 17% and 79% motion planning success rate over state of the art sampling, optimization and learning based planning methods.

Recent advancements in artificial intelligence (AI), particularly multimodal models like ChatGPT, have shown promise in transforming medical image analysis through capabilities such as medical vision-language question answering. However, there remains a significant gap in integrating pathology image data with these AI models for clinical applications. This study benchmarks the performance of GPT on pathology images, assessing their diagnostic accuracy and efficiency in real-word clinical records. We observe significant deficits of GPT in bone diseases and a fair-level performance in diseases from other three systems. Despite offering satisfactory abnormality annotations, GPT exhibits consistent disadvantage in terminology accuracy and multimodal integration. Specifically, we demonstrate GPT's failures in interpreting immunohistochemistry results and diagnosing metastatic cancers. This study highlight the weakness of current generalist GPT model and contribute to the integration of pathology and advanced AI.</p></details> |  |
| **[Learning A Low-Level Vision Generalist via Visual Task Prompt](https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08601v1)** | 2024-08-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Building a unified model for general low-level vision tasks holds significant research and practical value. Current methods encounter several critical issues. Multi-task restoration approaches can address multiple degradation-to-clean restoration tasks, while their applicability to tasks with different target domains (e.g., image stylization) is limited. Methods like PromptGIP can handle multiple input-target domains but rely on the Masked Autoencoder (MAE) paradigm. Consequently, they are tied to the ViT architecture, resulting in suboptimal image reconstruction quality. In addition, these methods are sensitive to prompt image content and often struggle with low-frequency information processing. In this paper, we propose a Visual task Prompt-based Image Processing (VPIP) framework to overcome these challenges. VPIP employs visual task prompts to manage tasks with different input-target domains and allows flexible selection of backbone network suitable for general tasks. Besides, a new prompt cross-attention is introduced to facilitate interaction between the input and prompt information. Based on the VPIP framework, we train a low-level vision generalist model, namely GenLV, on 30 diverse tasks. Experimental results show that GenLV can successfully address a variety of low-level tasks, significantly outperforming existing methods both quantitatively and qualitatively.

Generalist AI holds the potential to address these limitations due to its versatility in interpreting different data types and generating tailored outputs for diverse needs. However, existing biomedical generalist AI solutions are typically heavyweight and closed source to researchers, practitioners, and patients. Here, we propose BiomedGPT, the first open-source and lightweight vision-language foundation model, designed as a generalist capable of performing various biomedical tasks. BiomedGPT achieved state-of-the-art results in 16 out of 25 experiments while maintaining a computing-friendly model scale. We also conducted human evaluations to assess the capabilities of BiomedGPT in radiology visual question answering, report generation, and summarization. BiomedGPT exhibits robust prediction ability with a low error rate of 3.8% in question answering, satisfactory performance with an error rate of 8.3% in writing complex radiology reports, and competitive summarization ability with a nearly equivalent preference score to human experts. Our method demonstrates that effective training with diverse data can lead to more practical biomedical AI for improving diagnosis and workflow efficiency.</p></details> | <details><summary>Fix i...</summary><p>Fix incorrect citations and add journal reference for the published version.

Meanwhile, in other areas of robotics, large models and sim-to-real have led to tremendous progress. Inspired by such work, we present AutoMate, a learning framework and system that consists of 4 parts: 1) a dataset of 100 assemblies compatible with simulation and the real world, along with parallelized simulation environments for policy learning, 2) a novel simulation-based approach for learning specialist (i.e., part-specific) policies and generalist (i.e., unified) assembly policies, 3) demonstrations of specialist policies that individually solve 80 assemblies with 80% or higher success rates in simulation, as well as a generalist policy that jointly solves 20 assemblies with an 80%+ success rate, and 4) zero-shot sim-to-real transfer that achieves similar (or better) performance than simulation, including on perception-initialized assembly. The key methodological takeaway is that a union of diverse algorithms from manufacturing engineering, character animation, and time-series analysis provides a generic and robust solution for a diverse range of robotic assembly problems. To our knowledge, AutoMate provides the first simulation-based framework for learning specialist and generalist policies over a wide range of assemblies, as well as the first system demonstrating zero-shot sim-to-real transfer over such a range.

The internet is a promising source of large-scale demonstrations for training our robot agents. In particular, for the case of piano-playing, Youtube is full of videos of professional pianists playing a wide myriad of songs. In our work, we leverage these demonstrations to learn a generalist piano-playing agent capable of playing any arbitrary song. Our framework is divided into three parts: a data preparation phase to extract the informative features from the Youtube videos, a policy learning phase to train song-specific expert policies from the demonstrations and a policy distillation phase to distil the policies into a single generalist agent. We explore different policy designs to represent the agent and evaluate the influence of the amount of training data on the generalization capability of the agent to novel songs not available in the dataset. We show that we are able to learn a policy with up to 56\% F1 score on unseen songs.</p></details> |  |

However, the study of the robustness and generalizability of evolved artificial neural networks (ANNs) has remained limited. This has immense implications in the fields like robotics where such controllers are used in control tasks. Unexpected morphological or environmental changes during operation can risk failure if the ANN controllers are unable to handle these changes. This paper proposes an algorithm that aims to enhance the robustness and generalizability of the controllers. This is achieved by introducing morphological variations during the evolutionary training process. As a results, it is possible to discover generalist controllers that can handle a wide range of morphological variations sufficiently without the need of the information regarding their morphologies or adaptation of their parameters. We perform an extensive experimental analysis on simulation that demonstrates the trade-off between specialist and generalist controllers. The results show that generalists are able to control a range of morphological variations with a cost of underperforming on a specific morphology relative to a specialist. This research contributes to the field by addressing the limited understanding of robustness and generalizability and proposes a method by which to improve these properties.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been published in the proceedings of the Genetic and Evolutionary Computation Conference (GECCO '24)</p></details> |

However, a generalist MLLM typically underperforms compared with a specialist MLLM on most VL tasks, which can be attributed to task interference. In this paper, we propose a mixture of multimodal experts (MoME) to mitigate task interference and obtain a generalist MLLM. Our MoME is composed of two key components, a mixture of vision experts (MoVE) and a mixture of language experts (MoLE). MoVE can adaptively modulate the features transformed from various vision encoders, and has a strong compatibility in transformation architecture. MoLE incorporates sparsely gated experts into LLMs to achieve painless improvements with roughly unchanged inference costs. In response to task interference, our MoME specializes in both vision and language modality to adapt to task discrepancies. Extensive experiments show that MoME significantly improves the performance of generalist MLLMs across various VL tasks.

Diffusion models can now generate realistic images from text prompts, while recent advancements have demonstrated their ability to create diverse, high-quality videos. However, these models often struggle with generating accurate representations of medical procedures and detailed anatomical structures. This paper introduces Bora, the first spatio-temporal diffusion probabilistic model designed for text-guided biomedical video generation. Bora leverages Transformer architecture and is pre-trained on general-purpose video generation tasks. It is fine-tuned through model alignment and instruction tuning using a newly established medical video corpus, which includes paired text-video data from various biomedical fields. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to establish such a comprehensive annotated biomedical video dataset. Bora is capable of generating high-quality video data across four distinct biomedical domains, adhering to medical expert standards and demonstrating consistency and diversity. This generalist video generative model holds significant potential for enhancing medical consultation and decision-making, particularly in resource-limited settings. Additionally, Bora could pave the way for immersive medical training and procedure planning. Extensive experiments on distinct medical modalities such as endoscopy, ultrasound, MRI, and cell tracking validate the effectiveness of our model in understanding biomedical instructions and its superior performance across subjects compared to state-of-the-art generation models.</p></details> |  |

However, designing a unified generalist model that can effectively process diverse sensor modalities remains a challenge. This paper introduces MMPedestron, a novel generalist model for multimodal perception. Unlike previous specialist models that only process one or a pair of specific modality inputs, MMPedestron is able to process multiple modal inputs and their dynamic combinations. The proposed approach comprises a unified encoder for modal representation and fusion and a general head for pedestrian detection. We introduce two extra learnable tokens, i.e. MAA and MAF, for adaptive multi-modal feature fusion. In addition, we construct the MMPD dataset, the first large-scale benchmark for multi-modal pedestrian detection. This benchmark incorporates existing public datasets and a newly collected dataset called EventPed, covering a wide range of sensor modalities including RGB, IR, Depth, LiDAR, and Event data. With multi-modal joint training, our model achieves state-of-the-art performance on a wide range of pedestrian detection benchmarks, surpassing leading models tailored for specific sensor modality. For example, it achieves 71.1 AP on COCO-Persons and 72.6 AP on LLVIP. Notably, our model achieves comparable performance to the InternImage-H model on CrowdHuman with 30x smaller parameters.

Compared to directly scaling general abilities, SGI is defined as AI that specializes in at least one task, surpassing human experts, while also retaining general abilities. This fusion path enables SGI to rapidly achieve high-value areas. We categorize SGI into three stages based on the level of mastery over professional skills and generality performance. Additionally, we discuss the necessity of SGI in addressing issues associated with large language models, such as their insufficient generality, specialized capabilities, uncertainty in innovation, and practical applications. Furthermore, we propose a conceptual framework for developing SGI that integrates the strengths of Systems 1 and 2 cognitive processing. This framework comprises three layers and four key components, which focus on enhancing individual abilities and facilitating collaborative evolution. We conclude by summarizing the potential challenges and suggesting future directions. We hope that the proposed SGI will provide insights into further research and applications towards achieving AGI.</p></details> |  |

Recent works have shown image itself can be used as a natural interface for general-purpose visual perception and demonstrated inspiring results. In this paper, we explore diffusion-based vision generalists, where we unify different types of dense prediction tasks as conditional image generation and re-purpose pre-trained diffusion models for it. However, directly applying off-the-shelf latent diffusion models leads to a quantization issue. Thus, we propose to perform diffusion in pixel space and provide a recipe for finetuning pre-trained text-to-image diffusion models for dense vision tasks. In experiments, we evaluate our method on four different types of tasks and show competitive performance to the other vision generalists.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published at CVPR 2024 as a workshop paper</p></details> |

These systems extract relevant signal features and generate informative representations for particular tasks. However, building the feature extraction component for such systems requires extensive domain-specific expertise or data. The exceptionally rapid development of foundation models is likely to usher in newfound abilities in such intelligent sensing. We propose a new scheme for sensing model, which we refer to as semi-generalist sensing model (SGSM). SGSM is able to semiautomatically solve various tasks using relatively less task-specific labeled data compared to traditional systems. Built through the analysis of the common theoretical model, SGSM can depict different modalities, such as the acoustic and Wi-Fi signal. Experimental results on such two heterogeneous sensors illustrate that SGSM functions across a wide range of scenarios, thereby establishing its broad applicability. In some cases, SGSM even achieves better performance than sensor-specific specialized solutions. Wi-Fi evaluations indicate a 20\% accuracy improvement when applying SGSM to an existing sensing model.</p></details> |  |

The meta LLM can route to an expert LLM like generating new tokens. Expert-Token-Routing not only supports learning the implicit expertise of expert LLMs from existing instruction dataset but also allows for dynamic extension of new expert LLMs in a plug-and-play manner. It also conceals the detailed collaboration process from the user's perspective, facilitating interaction as though it were a singular LLM. Our framework outperforms various existing multi-LLM collaboration paradigms across benchmarks that incorporate six diverse expert domains, demonstrating effectiveness and robustness in building generalist LLM system via synergizing multiple expert LLMs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Medical Vision Generalist: Unifying Medical Imaging Tasks in Context](https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05565v1)** | 2024-06-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This study presents Medical Vision Generalist (MVG), the first foundation model capable of handling various medical imaging tasks -- such as cross-modal synthesis, image segmentation, denoising, and inpainting -- within a unified image-to-image generation framework. Specifically, MVG employs an in-context generation strategy that standardizes the handling of inputs and outputs as images. By treating these tasks as an image generation process conditioned on prompt image-label pairs and input images, this approach enables a flexible unification of various tasks, even those spanning different modalities and datasets. To capitalize on both local and global context, we design a hybrid method combining masked image modeling with autoregressive training for conditional image generation. This hybrid approach yields the most robust performance across all involved medical imaging tasks. To rigorously evaluate MVG's capabilities, we curated the first comprehensive generalist medical vision benchmark, comprising 13 datasets and spanning four imaging modalities (CT, MRI, X-ray, and micro-ultrasound). Our results consistently establish MVG's superior performance, outperforming existing vision generalists, such as Painter and LVM. Furthermore, MVG exhibits strong scalability, with its performance demonstrably improving when trained on a more diverse set of tasks, and can be effectively adapted to unseen datasets with only minimal task-specific samples.

This field is starting to grow rapidly with a surge of new design elements motivated by the success of foundation models in natural language processing (NLP) and vision. It is widely hoped that further extending the foundation models to multiple modalities (e.g., text, image, video, sensor, time series, graph, etc.) will ultimately lead to generalist multimodal models, i.e. one model across different data modalities and tasks. However, there is little research that systematically analyzes recent multimodal models (particularly the ones that work beyond text and vision) with respect to the underling architecture proposed. Therefore, this work provides a fresh perspective on generalist multimodal models (GMMs) via a novel architecture and training configuration specific taxonomy. This includes factors such as Unifiability, Modularity, and Adaptability that are pertinent and essential to the wide adoption and application of GMMs. The review further highlights key challenges and prospects for the field and guide the researchers into the new advancements.</p></details> | <details><summary>25 pa...</summary><p>25 pages, 3 figures, 5 tables</p></details> |

In Robotics, scaling is hindered by the lack of access to massive robot datasets. We advocate using realistic physical simulation as a means to scale environments, tasks, and datasets for robot learning methods. We present RoboCasa, a large-scale simulation framework for training generalist robots in everyday environments. RoboCasa features realistic and diverse scenes focusing on kitchen environments. We provide thousands of 3D assets across over 150 object categories and dozens of interactable furniture and appliances. We enrich the realism and diversity of our simulation with generative AI tools, such as object assets from text-to-3D models and environment textures from text-to-image models. We design a set of 100 tasks for systematic evaluation, including composite tasks generated by the guidance of large language models. To facilitate learning, we provide high-quality human demonstrations and integrate automated trajectory generation methods to substantially enlarge our datasets with minimal human burden. Our experiments show a clear scaling trend in using synthetically generated robot data for large-scale imitation learning and show great promise in harnessing simulation data in real-world tasks.

However, there has not been much effort toward enhancing the strategy of dreaming itself. Therefore, it is a question whether and how an agent can "dream better" in a more structured and strategic way. In this paper, inspired by the observation from cognitive science suggesting that humans use a spatial divide-and-conquer strategy in planning, we propose a new MBRL agent, called Dr. Strategy, which is equipped with a novel Dreaming Strategy. The proposed agent realizes a version of divide-and-conquer-like strategy in dreaming. This is achieved by learning a set of latent landmarks and then utilizing these to learn a landmark-conditioned highway policy. With the highway policy, the agent can first learn in the dream to move to a landmark, and from there it tackles the exploration and achievement task in a more focused way. In experiments, we show that the proposed model outperforms prior pixel-based MBRL methods in various visually complex and partially observable navigation tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>First...</summary><p>First two authors contributed equally</p></details> |

Recent research proposes numerous methods to improve their expressivity. However, conditioning on a context is largely overlooked area in the bijective flow research. Conventional conditioning with the vector concatenation is limited to only a few flow types. More importantly, this approach cannot support a practical setup where a set of context-conditioned (specialist) models are trained with the fixed pretrained general-knowledge (generalist) model. We propose ContextFlow++ approach to overcome these limitations using an additive conditioning with explicit generalist-specialist knowledge decoupling. Furthermore, we support discrete contexts by the proposed mixed-variable architecture with context encoders. Particularly, our context encoder for discrete variables is a surjective flow from which the context-conditioned continuous variables are sampled. Our experiments on rotated MNIST-R, corrupted CIFAR-10C, real-world ATM predictive maintenance and SMAP unsupervised anomaly detection benchmarks show that the proposed ContextFlow++ offers faster stable training and achieves higher performance metrics.

In this paper, we first propose to universally represent an arbitrary 3D complex as a geometric graph of sets, shedding light on encoding all types of molecules with one model. We then propose a Generalist Equivariant Transformer (GET) to effectively capture both domain-specific hierarchies and domain-agnostic interaction physics. To be specific, GET consists of a bilevel attention module, a feed-forward module and a layer normalization module, where each module is E(3) equivariant and specialized for handling sets of variable sizes. Notably, in contrast to conventional pooling-based hierarchical models, our GET is able to retain fine-grained information of all levels. Extensive experiments on the interactions between proteins, small molecules and RNA/DNAs verify the effectiveness and generalization capability of our proposed method across different domains.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ICML 2024</p></details> |

However, to be widely applicable across a range of robotic learning scenarios, environments, and tasks, such policies need to handle diverse sensors and action spaces, accommodate a variety of commonly used robotic platforms, and finetune readily and efficiently to new domains. In this work, we aim to lay the groundwork for developing open-source, widely applicable, generalist policies for robotic manipulation. As a first step, we introduce Octo, a large transformer-based policy trained on 800k trajectories from the Open X-Embodiment dataset, the largest robot manipulation dataset to date. It can be instructed via language commands or goal images and can be effectively finetuned to robot setups with new sensory inputs and action spaces within a few hours on standard consumer GPUs. In experiments across 9 robotic platforms, we demonstrate that Octo serves as a versatile policy initialization that can be effectively finetuned to new observation and action spaces.

However, existing AI models in this domain often require extensive annotation and are task-specific, limiting their clinical utility. While recent developments have brought about foundation models for ophthalmology, they are limited by the need to train separate weights for each imaging modality, preventing a comprehensive representation of multi-modal features. This highlights the need for versatile foundation models capable of handling various tasks and modalities in ophthalmology. To address this gap, we present EyeFound, a multimodal foundation model for ophthalmic images. Unlike existing models, EyeFound learns generalizable representations from unlabeled multimodal retinal images, enabling efficient model adaptation across multiple applications. Trained on 2.78 million images from 227 hospitals across 11 ophthalmic modalities, EyeFound facilitates generalist representations and diverse multimodal downstream tasks, even for detecting challenging rare diseases. It outperforms previous work RETFound in diagnosing eye diseases, predicting systemic disease incidents, and zero-shot multimodal VQA. EyeFound provides a generalizable solution to improve model performance and lessen the annotation burden on experts, facilitating widespread clinical AI applications for retinal imaging.</p></details> | <details><summary>21 pa...</summary><p>21 pages, 2 figures, 4 tables</p></details> |

However, several significant challenges remain: (i) most of these models rely on 2D images yet exhibit a limited capacity for 3D input; (ii) these models rarely explore the tasks inherently defined in 3D world, e.g., 3D grounding, embodied reasoning and acting. We argue these limitations significantly hinder current models from performing real-world tasks and approaching general intelligence. To this end, we introduce LEO, an embodied multi-modal generalist agent that excels in perceiving, grounding, reasoning, planning, and acting in the 3D world. LEO is trained with a unified task interface, model architecture, and objective in two stages: (i) 3D vision-language (VL) alignment and (ii) 3D vision-language-action (VLA) instruction tuning. We collect large-scale datasets comprising diverse object-level and scene-level tasks, which require considerable understanding of and interaction with the 3D world. Moreover, we meticulously design an LLM-assisted pipeline to produce high-quality 3D VL data. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate LEO's remarkable proficiency across a wide spectrum of tasks, including 3D captioning, question answering, embodied reasoning, navigation and manipulation. Our ablative studies and scaling analyses further provide valuable insights for developing future embodied generalist agents.

Prevailing methods address distinct restoration tasks independently, leading to intricate systems and the incapability to harness the potential synergies of multi-task learning. To overcome this challenge, we propose DocRes, a generalist model that unifies five document image restoration tasks including dewarping, deshadowing, appearance enhancement, deblurring, and binarization. To instruct DocRes to perform various restoration tasks, we propose a novel visual prompt approach called Dynamic Task-Specific Prompt (DTSPrompt). The DTSPrompt for different tasks comprises distinct prior features, which are additional characteristics extracted from the input image. Beyond its role as a cue for task-specific execution, DTSPrompt can also serve as supplementary information to enhance the model's performance. Moreover, DTSPrompt is more flexible than prior visual prompt approaches as it can be seamlessly applied and adapted to inputs with high and variable resolutions. Experimental results demonstrate that DocRes achieves competitive or superior performance compared to existing state-of-the-art task-specific models. This underscores the potential of DocRes across a broader spectrum of document image restoration tasks.

Fully mining such big data requires multitasking; otherwise, occult but important aspects may be overlooked, adversely affecting clinical management and population healthcare. Despite remarkable successes of AI in individual tasks with single-modal data, the progress in developing generalist medical AI remains relatively slow to combine multimodal data for multitasks because of the dual challenges of data curation and model architecture. The data challenge involves querying and curating multimodal structured and unstructured text, alphanumeric, and especially 3D tomographic scans on an individual patient level for real-time decisions and on a scale to estimate population health statistics. The model challenge demands a scalable and adaptable network architecture to integrate multimodal datasets for diverse clinical tasks. Here we propose the first-of-its-kind medical multimodal-multitask foundation model (M3FM) with application in lung cancer screening and related tasks. After we curated a comprehensive multimodal multitask dataset consisting of 49 clinical data types including 163,725 chest CT series and 17 medical tasks involved in LCS, we develop a multimodal question-answering framework as a unified training and inference strategy to synergize multimodal information and perform multiple tasks via free-text prompting. M3FM consistently outperforms the state-of-the-art single-modal task-specific models, identifies multimodal data elements informative for clinical tasks and flexibly adapts to new tasks with a small out-of-distribution dataset. As a specialty-oriented generalist medical AI model, M3FM paves the way for similar breakthroughs in other areas of medicine, closing the gap between specialists and the generalist.</p></details> |  |

Recent advancements have demonstrated the effectiveness of the pre-training and fine-tuning paradigm in PSRO to improve scalability in solving large-scale PEGs. However, these methods primarily focus on specific PEGs with fixed initial conditions that may vary substantially in real-world scenarios, which significantly hinders the applicability of the traditional methods. To address this issue, we introduce Grasper, a GeneRAlist purSuer for Pursuit-Evasion pRoblems, capable of efficiently generating pursuer policies tailored to specific PEGs. Our contributions are threefold: First, we present a novel architecture that offers high-quality solutions for diverse PEGs, comprising critical components such as (i) a graph neural network (GNN) to encode PEGs into hidden vectors, and (ii) a hypernetwork to generate pursuer policies based on these hidden vectors. As a second contribution, we develop an efficient three-stage training method involving (i) a pre-pretraining stage for learning robust PEG representations through self-supervised graph learning techniques like GraphMAE, (ii) a pre-training stage utilizing heuristic-guided multi-task pre-training (HMP) where heuristic-derived reference policies (e.g., through Dijkstra's algorithm) regularize pursuer policies, and (iii) a fine-tuning stage that employs PSRO to generate pursuer policies on designated PEGs. Finally, we perform extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world maps, showcasing Grasper's significant superiority over baselines in terms of solution quality and generalizability. We demonstrate that Grasper provides a versatile approach for solving pursuit-evasion problems across a broad range of scenarios, enabling practical deployment in real-world situations.</p></details> | <details><summary>To ap...</summary><p>To appear in the 23rd International Conference on Autonomous Agents and Multi-Agent Systems (AAMAS 2024)</p></details> |

While self-supervised pre-training approaches, e.g., Masked Autoencoder, have shown success in transfer learning, task-specific sub-architectures are still required to be appended for different downstream tasks, which cannot enjoy the benefits of large-scale pre-training. GLID overcomes this challenge by allowing the pre-trained generalist encoder-decoder to be fine-tuned on various vision tasks with minimal task-specific architecture modifications. In the GLID training scheme, pre-training pretext task and other downstream tasks are modeled as "query-to-answer" problems, including the pre-training pretext task and other downstream tasks. We pre-train a task-agnostic encoder-decoder with query-mask pairs. During fine-tuning, GLID maintains the pre-trained encoder-decoder and queries, only replacing the topmost linear transformation layer with task-specific linear heads. This minimizes the pretrain-finetune architecture inconsistency and enables the pre-trained model to better adapt to downstream tasks. GLID achieves competitive performance on various vision tasks, including object detection, image segmentation, pose estimation, and depth estimation, outperforming or matching specialist models such as Mask2Former, DETR, ViTPose, and BinsFormer.</p></details> | CVPR 2024 |

The efficacy of imitation learning is heavily reliant on the quantity and quality of the demonstration datasets. In this study, we aim to scale up demonstrations in a data-efficient way to facilitate the learning of generalist robotic agents. We introduce AdaDemo (Adaptive Online Demonstration Expansion), a general framework designed to improve multi-task policy learning by actively and continually expanding the demonstration dataset. AdaDemo strategically collects new demonstrations to address the identified weakness in the existing policy, ensuring data efficiency is maximized. Through a comprehensive evaluation on a total of 22 tasks across two robotic manipulation benchmarks (RLBench and Adroit), we demonstrate AdaDemo's capability to progressively improve policy performance by guiding the generation of high-quality demonstration datasets in a data-efficient manner.</p></details> |  |

However, current approaches are hindered by performance issues and difficulties in collecting training datasets. In this paper, we propose GeRM (Generalist Robotic Model). We utilize offline reinforcement learning to optimize data utilization strategies to learn from both demonstrations and sub-optimal data, thus surpassing the limitations of human demonstrations. Thereafter, we employ a transformer-based VLA network to process multi-modal inputs and output actions. By introducing the Mixture-of-Experts structure, GeRM allows faster inference speed with higher whole model capacity, and thus resolves the issue of limited RL parameters, enhancing model performance in multi-task learning while controlling computational costs. Through a series of experiments, we demonstrate that GeRM outperforms other methods across all tasks, while also validating its efficiency in both training and inference processes. Additionally, we uncover its potential to acquire emergent skills. Additionally, we contribute the QUARD-Auto dataset, collected automatically to support our training approach and foster advancements in multi-task quadruped robot learning. This work presents a new paradigm for reducing the cost of collecting robot data and driving progress in the multi-task learning community.

There has been a variety of tasks that aim to automatically interpret, augment, and query tables. Current methods often require pretraining on tables or special model architecture design, are restricted to specific table types, or have simplifying assumptions about tables and tasks. This paper makes the first step towards developing open-source large language models (LLMs) as generalists for a diversity of table-based tasks. Towards that end, we construct TableInstruct, a new dataset with a variety of realistic tables and tasks, for instruction tuning and evaluating LLMs. We further develop the first open-source generalist model for tables, TableLlama, by fine-tuning Llama 2 (7B) with LongLoRA to address the long context challenge. We experiment under both in-domain setting and out-of-domain setting. On 7 out of 8 in-domain tasks, TableLlama achieves comparable or better performance than the SOTA for each task, despite the latter often has task-specific design. On 6 out-of-domain datasets, it achieves 5-44 absolute point gains compared with the base model, showing that training on TableInstruct enhances the model's generalizability. We open-source our dataset and trained model to boost future work on developing open generalist models for tables.</p></details> | <details><summary>NAACL...</summary><p>NAACL 2024 long paper</p></details> |

However, generalist LMMs often suffer from performance degradation when tuned over a large collection of tasks. Recent research suggests that Mixture of Experts (MoE) architectures are useful for instruction tuning, but for LMMs of parameter size around O(50-100B), the prohibitive cost of replicating and storing the expert models severely limits the number of experts we can use. We propose Omni-SMoLA, an architecture that uses the Soft MoE approach to (softly) mix many multimodal low rank experts, and avoids introducing a significant number of new parameters compared to conventional MoE models. The core intuition here is that the large model provides a foundational backbone, while different lightweight experts residually learn specialized knowledge, either per-modality or multimodally. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the SMoLA approach helps improve the generalist performance across a broad range of generative vision-and-language tasks, achieving new SoTA generalist performance that often matches or outperforms single specialized LMM baselines, as well as new SoTA specialist performance.</p></details> |  |

Despite the major progress attained, previous works primarily focus on task-specific agents and lack generalizability to unseen scenarios. Recently, LLMs have presented remarkable capabilities across various fields, and provided a promising opportunity for embodied navigation. Drawing on this, we propose the first generalist model for embodied navigation, NaviLLM. It adapts LLMs to embodied navigation by introducing schema-based instruction. The schema-based instruction flexibly casts various tasks into generation problems, thereby unifying a wide range of tasks. This approach allows us to integrate diverse data sources from various datasets into the training, equipping NaviLLM with a wide range of capabilities required by embodied navigation. We conduct extensive experiments to evaluate the performance and generalizability of our model. The experimental results demonstrate that our unified model achieves state-of-the-art performance on CVDN, SOON, and ScanQA. Specifically, it surpasses the previous stats-of-the-art method by a significant margin of 29% in goal progress on CVDN. Moreover, our model also demonstrates strong generalizability and presents impressive results on unseen tasks, e.g., embodied question answering and 3D captioning.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by CVPR 2024 (14 pages, 3 figures)</p></details> |

| **[Toward Generalist Anomaly Detection via In-context Residual Learning with Few-shot Sample Prompts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06495v3)** | 2024-03-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper explores the problem of Generalist Anomaly Detection (GAD), aiming to train one single detection model that can generalize to detect anomalies in diverse datasets from different application domains without any further training on the target data. Some recent studies have shown that large pre-trained Visual-Language Models (VLMs) like CLIP have strong generalization capabilities on detecting industrial defects from various datasets, but their methods rely heavily on handcrafted text prompts about defects, making them difficult to generalize to anomalies in other applications, e.g., medical image anomalies or semantic anomalies in natural images. In this work, we propose to train a GAD model with few-shot normal images as sample prompts for AD on diverse datasets on the fly. To this end, we introduce a novel approach that learns an in-context residual learning model for GAD, termed InCTRL. It is trained on an auxiliary dataset to discriminate anomalies from normal samples based on a holistic evaluation of the residuals between query images and few-shot normal sample prompts. Regardless of the datasets, per definition of anomaly, larger residuals are expected for anomalies than normal samples, thereby enabling InCTRL to generalize across different domains without further training. Comprehensive experiments on nine AD datasets are performed to establish a GAD benchmark that encapsulate the detection of industrial defect anomalies, medical anomalies, and semantic anomalies in both one-vs-all and multi-class setting, on which InCTRL is the best performer and significantly outperforms state-of-the-art competing methods.

Despite these remarkable advances, the application of text-to-image generative models in computer vision for standard visual recognition tasks remains limited. The current de facto approach for these tasks is to design model architectures and loss functions that are tailored to the task at hand. In this paper, we develop a unified language interface for computer vision tasks that abstracts away task-specific design choices and enables task execution by following natural language instructions. Our approach involves casting multiple computer vision tasks as text-to-image generation problems. Here, the text represents an instruction describing the task, and the resulting image is a visually-encoded task output. To train our model, we pool commonly-used computer vision datasets covering a range of tasks, including segmentation, object detection, depth estimation, and classification. We then use a large language model to paraphrase prompt templates that convey the specific tasks to be conducted on each image, and through this process, we create a multi-modal and multi-task training dataset comprising input and output images along with annotated instructions. Following the InstructPix2Pix architecture, we apply instruction-tuning to a text-to-image diffusion model using our constructed dataset, steering its functionality from a generative model to an instruction-guided multi-task vision learner. Experiments demonstrate that our model, dubbed InstructCV, performs competitively compared to other generalist and task-specific vision models. Moreover, it exhibits compelling generalization capabilities to unseen data, categories, and user instructions.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICLR ...</summary><p>ICLR 2024; Code is available at https://github.com/AlaaLab/InstructCV</p></details> |

They apply uni-directional attention to capture sequential dependencies and generate task sequences recursively. However, such autoregressive Transformers may not fit vision tasks well, as vision task sequences usually lack the sequential dependencies typically observed in natural languages. In this work, we design Masked AutoDecoder~(MAD), an effective multi-task vision generalist. MAD consists of two core designs. First, we develop a parallel decoding framework that introduces bi-directional attention to capture contextual dependencies comprehensively and decode vision task sequences in parallel. Second, we design a masked sequence modeling approach that learns rich task contexts by masking and reconstructing task sequences. In this way, MAD handles all the tasks by a single network branch and a simple cross-entropy loss with minimal task-specific designs. Extensive experiments demonstrate the great potential of MAD as a new paradigm for unifying various vision tasks. MAD achieves superior performance and inference efficiency compared to autoregressive counterparts while obtaining competitive accuracy with task-specific models.

| **[Faceptor: A Generalist Model for Face Perception](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09500v1)** | 2024-03-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the comprehensive research conducted on various face analysis tasks, there is a growing interest among researchers to develop a unified approach to face perception. Existing methods mainly discuss unified representation and training, which lack task extensibility and application efficiency. To tackle this issue, we focus on the unified model structure, exploring a face generalist model. As an intuitive design, Naive Faceptor enables tasks with the same output shape and granularity to share the structural design of the standardized output head, achieving improved task extensibility. Furthermore, Faceptor is proposed to adopt a well-designed single-encoder dual-decoder architecture, allowing task-specific queries to represent new-coming semantics. This design enhances the unification of model structure while improving application efficiency in terms of storage overhead. Additionally, we introduce Layer-Attention into Faceptor, enabling the model to adaptively select features from optimal layers to perform the desired tasks. Through joint training on 13 face perception datasets, Faceptor achieves exceptional performance in facial landmark localization, face parsing, age estimation, expression recognition, binary attribute classification, and face recognition, achieving or surpassing specialized methods in most tasks. Our training framework can also be applied to auxiliary supervised learning, significantly improving performance in data-sparse tasks such as age estimation and expression recognition. The code and models will be made publicly available at https://github.com/lxq1000/Faceptor.</p></details> |  |
| **[GiT: Towards Generalist Vision Transformer through Universal Language Interface](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09394v1)** | 2024-03-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper proposes a simple, yet effective framework, called GiT, simultaneously applicable for various vision tasks only with a vanilla ViT. Motivated by the universality of the Multi-layer Transformer architecture (e.g, GPT) widely used in large language models (LLMs), we seek to broaden its scope to serve as a powerful vision foundation model (VFM). However, unlike language modeling, visual tasks typically require specific modules, such as bounding box heads for detection and pixel decoders for segmentation, greatly hindering the application of powerful multi-layer transformers in the vision domain. To solve this, we design a universal language interface that empowers the successful auto-regressive decoding to adeptly unify various visual tasks, from image-level understanding (e.g., captioning), over sparse perception (e.g., detection), to dense prediction (e.g., segmentation). Based on the above designs, the entire model is composed solely of a ViT, without any specific additions, offering a remarkable architectural simplification. GiT is a multi-task visual model, jointly trained across five representative benchmarks without task-specific fine-tuning. Interestingly, our GiT builds a new benchmark in generalist performance, and fosters mutual enhancement across tasks, leading to significant improvements compared to isolated training. This reflects a similar impact observed in LLMs. Further enriching training with 27 datasets, GiT achieves strong zero-shot results over various tasks. Due to its simple design, this paradigm holds promise for narrowing the architectural gap between vision and language. Code and models will be available at \url{https://github.com/Haiyang-W/GiT}.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we explore the potential of LMMs like GPT-4V as a generalist web agent that can follow natural language instructions to complete tasks on any given website. We propose SEEACT, a generalist web agent that harnesses the power of LMMs for integrated visual understanding and acting on the web. We evaluate on the recent MIND2WEB benchmark. In addition to standard offline evaluation on cached websites, we enable a new online evaluation setting by developing a tool that allows running web agents on live websites. We show that GPT-4V presents a great potential for web agents -- it can successfully complete 51.1 of the tasks on live websites if we manually ground its textual plans into actions on the websites. This substantially outperforms text-only LLMs like GPT-4 or smaller models (FLAN-T5 and BLIP-2) specifically fine-tuned for web agents. However, grounding still remains a major challenge. Existing LMM grounding strategies like set-of-mark prompting turns out to be not effective for web agents, and the best grounding strategy we develop in this paper leverages both the HTML structure and visuals. Yet, there is still a substantial gap with oracle grounding, leaving ample room for further improvement. All code, data, and evaluation tools are available at https://github.com/OSU-NLP-Group/SeeAct.</p></details> |  |

However, to achieve optimal performance, specially designed prompting methods are still needed. These methods either rely on task-specific few-shot examples that require a certain level of domain knowledge, or are designed to be simple but only perform well on a few types of tasks. In this work, we attempt to introduce the concept of generalist prompting, which operates on the design principle of achieving optimal or near-optimal performance on a wide range of tasks while eliminating the need for manual selection and customization of prompts tailored to specific problems. Furthermore, we propose MeMo (Mental Models), an innovative prompting method that is simple-designed yet effectively fulfills the criteria of generalist prompting. MeMo distills the cores of various prompting methods into individual mental models and allows LLMs to autonomously select the most suitable mental models for the problem, achieving or being near to the state-of-the-art results on diverse tasks such as STEM, logical reasoning, and commonsense reasoning in zero-shot settings. We hope that the insights presented herein will stimulate further exploration of generalist prompting methods for LLMs.</p></details> |  |

Their use in this highly critical and sensitive domain has thus raised important questions about their robustness, especially in response to variations in input, and the reliability of the generated outputs. This study addresses these questions by constructing a textual dataset based on the ICD-10-CM code descriptions, widely used in US hospitals and containing many clinical terms, and their easily reproducible rephrasing. We then benchmarked existing embedding models, either generalist or specialized in the clinical domain, in a semantic search task where the goal was to correctly match the rephrased text to the original description. Our results showed that generalist models performed better than clinical models, suggesting that existing clinical specialized models are more sensitive to small changes in input that confuse them.

To achieve this goal, we initially formulate a unified facial representation for a broad spectrum of facial editing tasks, which macroscopically decomposes a face into fundamental identity, intra-personal variation, and environmental factors. Based on this, we introduce Facial Omni-Representation Decomposing (FORD) for seamless manipulation of various facial components, microscopically decomposing the core aspects of most facial editing tasks. Furthermore, by leveraging the prior of a pretrained StableDiffusion (SD) to enhance generation quality and accelerate training, we design Facial Omni-Representation Steering (FORS) to first assemble unified facial representations and then effectively steer the SD-aware generation process by the efficient Facial Representation Controller (FRC). %Without any additional features, Our versatile FaceX achieves competitive performance compared to elaborate task-specific models on popular facial editing tasks. Full codes and models will be available at https://github.com/diffusion-facex/FaceX.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://diffusion-facex.github.io/</p></details> |
| **[Harnessing Pre-trained Generalist Agents for Software Engineering Tasks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.15536v1)** | 2023-12-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Nowadays, we are witnessing an increasing adoption of Artificial Intelligence (AI) to develop techniques aimed at improving the reliability, effectiveness, and overall quality of software systems. Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has recently been successfully used for automation in complex tasks such as game testing and solving the job-shop scheduling problem. However, these specialized DRL agents, trained from scratch on specific tasks, suffer from a lack of generalizability to other tasks and they need substantial time to be developed and re-trained effectively. Recently, DRL researchers have begun to develop generalist agents, able to learn a policy from various environments and capable of achieving performances similar to or better than specialist agents in new tasks. In the Natural Language Processing or Computer Vision domain, these generalist agents are showing promising adaptation capabilities to never-before-seen tasks after a light fine-tuning phase and achieving high performance. This paper investigates the potential of generalist agents for solving SE tasks. Specifically, we conduct an empirical study aimed at assessing the performance of two generalist agents on two important SE tasks: the detection of bugs in games (for two games) and the minimization of makespan in a scheduling task, to solve the job-shop scheduling problem (for two instances). Our results show that the generalist agents outperform the specialist agents with very little effort for fine-tuning, achieving a 20% reduction of the makespan over specialized agent performance on task-based scheduling. In the context of game testing, some generalist agent configurations detect 85% more bugs than the specialist agents. Building on our analysis, we provide recommendations for researchers and practitioners looking to select generalist agents for SE tasks, to ensure that they perform effectively.</p></details> |  |

Inspired by recent advances in foundation models for vision and language, we propose a multi-embodiment, multi-task generalist agent for robotic manipulation. This agent, named RoboCat, is a visual goal-conditioned decision transformer capable of consuming action-labelled visual experience. This data spans a large repertoire of motor control skills from simulated and real robotic arms with varying sets of observations and actions. With RoboCat, we demonstrate the ability to generalise to new tasks and robots, both zero-shot as well as through adaptation using only 100-1000 examples for the target task. We also show how a trained model itself can be used to generate data for subsequent training iterations, thus providing a basic building block for an autonomous improvement loop. We investigate the agent's capabilities, with large-scale evaluations both in simulation and on three different real robot embodiments. We find that as we grow and diversify its training data, RoboCat not only shows signs of cross-task transfer, but also becomes more efficient at adapting to new tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Trans...</summary><p>Transactions on Machine Learning Research (12/2023)</p></details> |

Existing datasets for web agents either use simulated websites or only cover a limited set of websites and tasks, thus not suitable for generalist web agents. With over 2,000 open-ended tasks collected from 137 websites spanning 31 domains and crowdsourced action sequences for the tasks, Mind2Web provides three necessary ingredients for building generalist web agents: 1) diverse domains, websites, and tasks, 2) use of real-world websites instead of simulated and simplified ones, and 3) a broad spectrum of user interaction patterns. Based on Mind2Web, we conduct an initial exploration of using large language models (LLMs) for building generalist web agents. While the raw HTML of real-world websites are often too large to be fed to LLMs, we show that first filtering it with a small LM significantly improves the effectiveness and efficiency of LLMs. Our solution demonstrates a decent level of performance, even on websites or entire domains the model has never seen before, but there is still a substantial room to improve towards truly generalizable agents. We open-source our dataset, model implementation, and trained models (https://osu-nlp-group.github.io/Mind2Web) to facilitate further research on building a generalist agent for the web.</p></details> | <details><summary>Websi...</summary><p>Website: https://osu-nlp-group.github.io/Mind2Web.

The daunting challenges in this field stem from the difficulty of optimizing in high-dimensional action spaces and the instability introduced by the bipedal morphology of humanoids. However, the extensive collection of human motion-captured data and the derived datasets of humanoid trajectories, such as MoCapAct, paves the way to tackle these challenges. In this context, we present Humanoid Generalist Autoencoding Planner (H-GAP), a state-action trajectory generative model trained on humanoid trajectories derived from human motion-captured data, capable of adeptly handling downstream control tasks with Model Predictive Control (MPC). For 56 degrees of freedom humanoid, we empirically demonstrate that H-GAP learns to represent and generate a wide range of motor behaviours. Further, without any learning from online interactions, it can also flexibly transfer these behaviors to solve novel downstream control tasks via planning. Notably, H-GAP excels established MPC baselines that have access to the ground truth dynamics model, and is superior or comparable to offline RL methods trained for individual tasks. Finally, we do a series of empirical studies on the scaling properties of H-GAP, showing the potential for performance gains via additional data but not computing.

Bridging the gap between understanding these principles and their actual clinical and real-world applications demands rigorous exploration and adept implementation. In recent times, the swift advancement of highly adaptive and reusable artificial intelligence (AI) models has emerged as a promising way to unlock unprecedented capabilities in the realm of psychology. This paper emphasizes the importance of performance validation for these large-scale AI models, emphasizing the need to offer a comprehensive assessment of their verification from diverse perspectives. Moreover, we review the cutting-edge advancements and practical implementations of these expansive models in psychology, highlighting pivotal work spanning areas such as social media analytics, clinical nursing insights, vigilant community monitoring, and the nuanced exploration of psychological theories. Based on our review, we project an acceleration in the progress of psychological fields, driven by these large-scale AI models. These future generalist AI models harbor the potential to substantially curtail labor costs and alleviate social stress. However, this forward momentum will not be without its set of challenges, especially when considering the paradigm changes and upgrades required for medical instrumentation and related applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[Can Generalist Foundation Models Outcompete Special-Purpose Tuning? Case Study in Medicine](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.16452v1)** | 2023-11-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generalist foundation models such as GPT-4 have displayed surprising capabilities in a wide variety of domains and tasks. Yet, there is a prevalent assumption that they cannot match specialist capabilities of fine-tuned models. For example, most explorations to date on medical competency benchmarks have leveraged domain-specific training, as exemplified by efforts on BioGPT and Med-PaLM. We build on a prior study of GPT-4's capabilities on medical challenge benchmarks in the absence of special training. Rather than using simple prompting to highlight the model's out-of-the-box capabilities, we perform a systematic exploration of prompt engineering. We find that prompting innovation can unlock deeper specialist capabilities and show that GPT-4 easily tops prior leading results for medical benchmarks. The prompting methods we explore are general purpose, and make no specific use of domain expertise, removing the need for expert-curated content. Our experimental design carefully controls for overfitting during the prompt engineering process. We introduce Medprompt, based on a composition of several prompting strategies. With Medprompt, GPT-4 achieves state-of-the-art results on all nine of the benchmark datasets in the MultiMedQA suite. The method outperforms leading specialist models such as Med-PaLM 2 by a significant margin with an order of magnitude fewer calls to the model. Steering GPT-4 with Medprompt achieves a 27% reduction in error rate on the MedQA dataset over the best methods to date achieved with specialist models and surpasses a score of 90% for the first time. Beyond medical problems, we show the power of Medprompt to generalize to other domains and provide evidence for the broad applicability of the approach via studies of the strategy on exams in electrical engineering, machine learning, philosophy, accounting, law, nursing, and clinical psychology.</p></details> | 21 pages, 7 figures |

Although GPT-4V has shown promising results in various multi-modal tasks, leveraging GPT-4V as a generalist evaluator for these tasks has not yet been systematically explored. We comprehensively validate GPT-4V's capabilities for evaluation purposes, addressing tasks ranging from foundational image-to-text and text-to-image synthesis to high-level image-to-image translations and multi-images to text alignment. We employ two evaluation methods, single-answer grading and pairwise comparison, using GPT-4V. Notably, GPT-4V shows promising agreement with humans across various tasks and evaluation methods, demonstrating immense potential for multi-modal LLMs as evaluators. Despite limitations like restricted visual clarity grading and real-world complex reasoning, its ability to provide human-aligned scores enriched with detailed explanations is promising for universal automatic evaluator.</p></details> |  |
| **[Specialist or Generalist? Instruction Tuning for Specific NLP Tasks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.15326v1)** | 2023-10-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The potential of large language models (LLMs) to simultaneously perform a wide range of natural language processing (NLP) tasks has been the subject of extensive research. Although instruction tuning has proven to be a data-efficient method for transforming LLMs into such generalist models, their performance still lags behind specialist models trained exclusively for specific tasks. In this paper, we investigate whether incorporating broad-coverage generalist instruction tuning can contribute to building a specialist model. We hypothesize that its efficacy depends on task specificity and skill requirements. Our experiments assess four target tasks with distinct coverage levels, revealing that integrating generalist instruction tuning consistently enhances model performance when the task coverage is broad. The effect is particularly pronounced when the amount of task-specific training data is limited. Further investigation into three target tasks focusing on different capabilities demonstrates that generalist instruction tuning improves understanding and reasoning abilities. However, for tasks requiring factual knowledge, generalist data containing hallucinatory information may negatively affect the model's performance. Overall, our work provides a systematic guide for developing specialist models with general instruction tuning.

After pre-training, VisionFM provides a foundation to foster multiple ophthalmic artificial intelligence (AI) applications, such as disease screening and diagnosis, disease prognosis, subclassification of disease phenotype, and systemic biomarker and disease prediction, with each application enhanced with expert-level intelligence and accuracy. The generalist intelligence of VisionFM outperformed ophthalmologists with basic and intermediate levels in jointly diagnosing 12 common ophthalmic diseases. Evaluated on a new large-scale ophthalmic disease diagnosis benchmark database, as well as a new large-scale segmentation and detection benchmark database, VisionFM outperformed strong baseline deep neural networks. The ophthalmic image representations learned by VisionFM exhibited noteworthy explainability, and demonstrated strong generalizability to new ophthalmic modalities, disease spectrum, and imaging devices. As a foundation model, VisionFM has a large capacity to learn from diverse ophthalmic imaging data and disparate datasets. To be commensurate with this capacity, in addition to the real data used for pre-training, we also generated and leveraged synthetic ophthalmic imaging data. Experimental results revealed that synthetic data that passed visual Turing tests, can also enhance the representation learning capability of VisionFM, leading to substantial performance gains on downstream ophthalmic AI tasks. Beyond the ophthalmic AI applications developed, validated, and demonstrated in this work, substantial further applications can be achieved in an efficient and cost-effective manner using VisionFM as the foundation.</p></details> |  |

The MAmmoTH models are trained on MathInstruct, our meticulously curated instruction tuning dataset. MathInstruct is compiled from 13 math datasets with intermediate rationales, six of which have rationales newly curated by us. It presents a unique hybrid of chain-of-thought (CoT) and program-of-thought (PoT) rationales, and also ensures extensive coverage of diverse fields in math. The hybrid of CoT and PoT not only unleashes the potential of tool use but also allows different thought processes for different math problems. As a result, the MAmmoTH series substantially outperform existing open-source models on nine mathematical reasoning datasets across all scales with an average accuracy gain between 16% and 32%. Remarkably, our MAmmoTH-7B model reaches 33% on MATH (a competition-level dataset), which exceeds the best open-source 7B model (WizardMath) by 23%, and the MAmmoTH-34B model achieves 44% accuracy on MATH, even surpassing GPT-4's CoT result. Our work underscores the importance of diverse problem coverage and the use of hybrid rationales in developing superior math generalist models.</p></details> | <details><summary>Work ...</summary><p>Work in progress; Xiang Yue and Wenhu Chen contributed equally to this paper</p></details> |
| **[A Generalist Dynamics Model for Control](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.10912v2)** | 2023-09-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We investigate the use of transformer sequence models as dynamics models (TDMs) for control. We find that TDMs exhibit strong generalization capabilities to unseen environments, both in a few-shot setting, where a generalist TDM is fine-tuned with small amounts of data from the target environment, and in a zero-shot setting, where a generalist TDM is applied to an unseen environment without any further training. Here, we demonstrate that generalizing system dynamics can work much better than generalizing optimal behavior directly as a policy. Additional results show that TDMs also perform well in a single-environment learning setting when compared to a number of baseline models. These properties make TDMs a promising ingredient for a foundation model of control.</p></details> |  |
| **[InstructDiffusion: A Generalist Modeling Interface for Vision Tasks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.03895v1)** | 2023-09-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present InstructDiffusion, a unifying and generic framework for aligning computer vision tasks with human instructions. Unlike existing approaches that integrate prior knowledge and pre-define the output space (e.g., categories and coordinates) for each vision task, we cast diverse vision tasks into a human-intuitive image-manipulating process whose output space is a flexible and interactive pixel space. Concretely, the model is built upon the diffusion process and is trained to predict pixels according to user instructions, such as encircling the man's left shoulder in red or applying a blue mask to the left car. InstructDiffusion could handle a variety of vision tasks, including understanding tasks (such as segmentation and keypoint detection) and generative tasks (such as editing and enhancement). It even exhibits the ability to handle unseen tasks and outperforms prior methods on novel datasets. This represents a significant step towards a generalist modeling interface for vision tasks, advancing artificial general intelligence in the field of computer vision.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards Generalist Robots: A Promising Paradigm via Generative Simulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.10455v3)** | 2023-08-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This document serves as a position paper that outlines the authors' vision for a potential pathway towards generalist robots. The purpose of this document is to share the excitement of the authors with the community and highlight a promising research direction in robotics and AI. The authors believe the proposed paradigm is a feasible path towards accomplishing the long-standing goal of robotics research: deploying robots, or embodied AI agents more broadly, in various non-factory real-world settings to perform diverse tasks. This document presents a specific idea for mining knowledge in the latest large-scale foundation models for robotics research. Instead of directly using or adapting these models to produce low-level policies and actions, it advocates for a fully automated generative pipeline (termed as generative simulation), which uses these models to generate diversified tasks, scenes and training supervisions at scale, thereby scaling up low-level skill learning and ultimately leading to a foundation model for robotics that empowers generalist robots. The authors are actively pursuing this direction, but in the meantime, they recognize that the ambitious goal of building generalist robots with large-scale policy training demands significant resources such as computing power and hardware, and research groups in academia alone may face severe resource constraints in implementing the entire vision. Therefore, the authors believe sharing their thoughts at this early stage could foster discussions, attract interest towards the proposed pathway and related topics from industry groups, and potentially spur significant technical advancements in the field.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards Generalist Biomedical AI](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.14334v1)** | 2023-07-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Medicine is inherently multimodal, with rich data modalities spanning text, imaging, genomics, and more. Generalist biomedical artificial intelligence (AI) systems that flexibly encode, integrate, and interpret this data at scale can potentially enable impactful applications ranging from scientific discovery to care delivery. To enable the development of these models, we first curate MultiMedBench, a new multimodal biomedical benchmark. MultiMedBench encompasses 14 diverse tasks such as medical question answering, mammography and dermatology image interpretation, radiology report generation and summarization, and genomic variant calling. We then introduce Med-PaLM Multimodal (Med-PaLM M), our proof of concept for a generalist biomedical AI system. Med-PaLM M is a large multimodal generative model that flexibly encodes and interprets biomedical data including clinical language, imaging, and genomics with the same set of model weights. Med-PaLM M reaches performance competitive with or exceeding the state of the art on all MultiMedBench tasks, often surpassing specialist models by a wide margin. We also report examples of zero-shot generalization to novel medical concepts and tasks, positive transfer learning across tasks, and emergent zero-shot medical reasoning. To further probe the capabilities and limitations of Med-PaLM M, we conduct a radiologist evaluation of model-generated (and human) chest X-ray reports and observe encouraging performance across model scales. In a side-by-side ranking on 246 retrospective chest X-rays, clinicians express a pairwise preference for Med-PaLM M reports over those produced by radiologists in up to 40.50% of cases, suggesting potential clinical utility. While considerable work is needed to validate these models in real-world use cases, our results represent a milestone towards the development of generalist biomedical AI systems.</p></details> |  |

The generalizability of existing methods can still be suboptimal for a multi-center study due to domain shifts, which result from non-identical data distribution among centers with different imaging systems/protocols. While some approaches address domain shifts by training specialized models for each center, they are parameter inefficient and do not well exploit the shared knowledge across centers. To address this, we develop a generalist model that shares architecture and parameters across centers to utilize the shared knowledge. However, the generalist model can suffer from the center interference issue, \textit{i.e.} the gradient directions of different centers can be inconsistent or even opposite owing to the non-identical data distribution. To mitigate such interference, we introduce a novel dynamic routing strategy with cross-layer connections that routes data from different centers to different experts. Experiments show that our generalist model with dynamic routing (DRMC) exhibits excellent generalizability across centers.

Those benchmarks are representative and commonly used in model development. Our experimental results indicate that while SAM presents remarkable segmentation performance on images from the general domain, its zero-shot segmentation ability remains restricted for out-of-distribution images, e.g., medical images. In addition, SAM exhibits inconsistent zero-shot segmentation performance across different unseen medical domains. For certain structured targets, e.g., blood vessels, the zero-shot segmentation of SAM completely failed. In contrast, a simple fine-tuning of it with a small amount of data could lead to remarkable improvement of the segmentation quality, showing the great potential and feasibility of using fine-tuned SAM to achieve accurate medical image segmentation for a precision diagnostics. Our study indicates the versatility of generalist vision foundation models on medical imaging, and their great potential to achieve desired performance through fine-turning and eventually address the challenges associated with accessing large and diverse medical datasets in support of clinical diagnostics.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in Diagnostics</p></details> |

On one hand, the dominant paradigm in clinical machine learning is narrow in the sense that models are trained on biomedical datasets for particular clinical tasks such as diagnosis and treatment recommendation. On the other hand, the emerging paradigm is generalist in the sense that general-purpose language models such as Google's BERT and PaLM are increasingly being adapted for clinical use cases via prompting or fine-tuning on biomedical datasets. Many of these next-generation models provide substantial performance gains over prior clinical models, but at the same time introduce novel kinds of algorithmic bias and complicate the explanatory relationship between algorithmic biases and biases in training data. This paper articulates how and in what respects biases in generalist models differ from biases in prior clinical models, and draws out practical recommendations for algorithmic bias mitigation.</p></details> | 20 pages, 0 figures |

Despite impressive progress in English-oriented large-scale language models (LLMs), it is still under-explored whether English-based foundation LLMs can perform similarly on multilingual tasks compared to English tasks with well-designed instruction tuning and how we can construct the corpora needed for the tuning. To remedy this gap, we propose the project as an attempt to create a Chinese instruction dataset by various methods adapted to the intrinsic characteristics of 4 sub-tasks. We collect around 200k Chinese instruction tuning samples, which have been manually checked to guarantee high quality. We also summarize the existing English and Chinese instruction corpora and briefly describe some potential applications of the newly constructed Chinese instruction corpora.

But in computer vision, the difficulties for in-context learning lie in that tasks vary significantly in the output representations, thus it is unclear how to define the general-purpose task prompts that the vision model can understand and transfer to out-of-domain tasks. In this work, we present Painter, a generalist model which addresses these obstacles with an "image"-centric solution, that is, to redefine the output of core vision tasks as images, and specify task prompts as also images. With this idea, our training process is extremely simple, which performs standard masked image modeling on the stitch of input and output image pairs. This makes the model capable of performing tasks conditioned on visible image patches. Thus, during inference, we can adopt a pair of input and output images from the same task as the input condition, to indicate which task to perform. Without bells and whistles, our generalist Painter can achieve competitive performance compared to well-established task-specific models, on seven representative vision tasks ranging from high-level visual understanding to low-level image processing. In addition, Painter significantly outperforms recent generalist models on several challenging tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to CVPR 2023.

Although adversarial training demonstrates its capability to defend against adversarial examples, unfortunately, it leads to an inevitable drop in the natural generalization. To address the issue, we decouple the natural generalization and the robust generalization from joint training and formulate different training strategies for each one. Specifically, instead of minimizing a global loss on the expectation over these two generalization errors, we propose a bi-expert framework called \emph{Generalist} where we simultaneously train base learners with task-aware strategies so that they can specialize in their own fields. The parameters of base learners are collected and combined to form a global learner at intervals during the training process. The global learner is then distributed to the base learners as initialized parameters for continued training. Theoretically, we prove that the risks of Generalist will get lower once the base learners are well trained. Extensive experiments verify the applicability of Generalist to achieve high accuracy on natural examples while maintaining considerable robustness to adversarial ones.

| **[MGA: Medical generalist agent through text-guided knowledge transformation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.08562v1)** | 2023-03-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-modal representation methods have achieved advanced performance in medical applications by extracting more robust features from multi-domain data. However, existing methods usually need to train additional branches for downstream tasks, which may increase the model complexities in clinical applications as well as introduce additional human inductive bias. Besides, very few studies exploit the rich clinical knowledge embedded in clinical daily reports. To this end, we propose a novel medical generalist agent, MGA, that can address three kinds of common clinical tasks via clinical reports knowledge transformation. Unlike the existing methods, MGA can easily adapt to different tasks without specific downstream branches when their corresponding annotations are missing. More importantly, we are the first attempt to use medical professional language guidance as a transmission medium to guide the agent's behavior. The proposed method is implemented on four well-known X-ray open-source datasets, MIMIC-CXR, CheXpert, MIMIC-CXR-JPG, and MIMIC-CXR-MS.

| **[OFASys: A Multi-Modal Multi-Task Learning System for Building Generalist Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.04408v1)** | 2022-12-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generalist models, which are capable of performing diverse multi-modal tasks in a task-agnostic way within a single model, have been explored recently. Being, hopefully, an alternative to approaching general-purpose AI, existing generalist models are still at an early stage, where modality and task coverage is limited. To empower multi-modal task-scaling and speed up this line of research, we release a generalist model learning system, OFASys, built on top of a declarative task interface named multi-modal instruction. At the core of OFASys is the idea of decoupling multi-modal task representations from the underlying model implementations. In OFASys, a task involving multiple modalities can be defined declaratively even with just a single line of code. The system automatically generates task plans from such instructions for training and inference. It also facilitates multi-task training for diverse multi-modal workloads. As a starting point, we provide presets of 7 different modalities and 23 highly-diverse example tasks in OFASys, with which we also develop a first-in-kind, single model, OFA+, that can handle text, image, speech, video, and motion data. The single OFA+ model achieves 95% performance in average with only 16% parameters of 15 task-finetuned models, showcasing the performance reliability of multi-modal task-scaling provided by OFASys.

We address the problem of developing generalist representations of text that can be used to perform a range of different tasks rather than being specialised to a single application. We focus on processing short questions and developing an embedding for these questions that is useful on a diverse set of problems, such as question topic classification, equivalent question recognition, and question answering. This paper introduces QBERT, a generalist model for processing questions. With QBERT, we demonstrate how we can train a multi-task network that performs all question-related tasks and has achieved similar performance compared to its corresponding single-task models.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Generalist Neural Algorithmic Learner](https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.11142v2)** | 2022-12-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The cornerstone of neural algorithmic reasoning is the ability to solve algorithmic tasks, especially in a way that generalises out of distribution. While recent years have seen a surge in methodological improvements in this area, they mostly focused on building specialist models. Specialist models are capable of learning to neurally execute either only one algorithm or a collection of algorithms with identical control-flow backbone. Here, instead, we focus on constructing a generalist neural algorithmic learner -- a single graph neural network processor capable of learning to execute a wide range of algorithms, such as sorting, searching, dynamic programming, path-finding and geometry. We leverage the CLRS benchmark to empirically show that, much like recent successes in the domain of perception, generalist algorithmic learners can be built by "incorporating" knowledge. That is, it is possible to effectively learn algorithms in a multi-task manner, so long as we can learn to execute them well in a single-task regime. Motivated by this, we present a series of improvements to the input representation, training regime and processor architecture over CLRS, improving average single-task performance by over 20% from prior art. We then conduct a thorough ablation of multi-task learners leveraging these improvements. Our results demonstrate a generalist learner that effectively incorporates knowledge captured by specialist models.</p></details> | <details><summary>To ap...</summary><p>To appear at LoG 2022 (Spotlight talk). 23 pages, 11 figures</p></details> |

The key to eliminating this inconsistency is to use generalist models for general task modeling. However, existing attempts at generalist models are inadequate in both versatility and performance. In this paper, we propose Uni-Perceiver v2, which is the first generalist model capable of handling major large-scale vision and vision-language tasks with competitive performance. Specifically, images are encoded as general region proposals, while texts are encoded via a Transformer-based language model. The encoded representations are transformed by a task-agnostic decoder. Different tasks are formulated as a unified maximum likelihood estimation problem. We further propose an improved optimizer to ensure stable multi-task learning with an unmixed sampling strategy, which is helpful for tasks requiring large batch-size training. After being jointly trained on various tasks, Uni-Perceiver v2 is capable of directly handling downstream tasks without any task-specific adaptation. Results show that Uni-Perceiver v2 outperforms all existing generalist models in both versatility and performance. Meanwhile, compared with the commonly-recognized strong baselines that require tasks-specific fine-tuning, Uni-Perceiver v2 achieves competitive performance on a broad range of vision and vision-language tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code ...</summary><p>Code shall be released at https://github.com/fundamentalvision/Uni-Perceiver</p></details> |

However, offline RL faces the distribution shift problem. The policy constraint offline RL method is proposed to solve the distribution shift problem. During the policy constraint offline RL training, it is important to ensure the difference between the learned policy and behavior policy within a given threshold. Thus, the learned policy heavily relies on the quality of the behavior policy. However, a problem exists in existing policy constraint methods: if the dataset contains many low-reward transitions, the learned will be contained with a suboptimal reference policy, leading to slow learning speed, low sample efficiency, and inferior performances. This paper shows that the sampling method in policy constraint offline RL that uses all the transitions in the dataset can be improved. A simple but efficient sample filtering method is proposed to improve the sample efficiency and the final performance. First, we evaluate the score of the transitions by average reward and average discounted reward of episodes in the dataset and extract the transition samples of high scores. Second, the high-score transition samples are used to train the offline RL algorithms. We verify the proposed method in a series of offline RL algorithms and benchmark tasks. Experimental results show that the proposed method outperforms baselines.</p></details> |  |

Assuming the optimality of human demonstrations is core to existing VLA policies. However, we claim that in highly dexterous and precise manipulation tasks, human demonstrations are noisy and suboptimal. GR-RL proposes a multi-stage training pipeline that filters, augments, and reinforces the demonstrations by reinforcement learning. First, GR-RL learns a vision-language-conditioned task progress, filters the demonstration trajectories, and only keeps the transitions that contribute positively to the progress. Specifically, we show that by directly applying offline RL with sparse reward, the resulting $Q$-values can be treated as a robust progress function. Next, we introduce morphological symmetry augmentation that greatly improves the generalization and performance of GR-RL. Lastly, to better align the VLA policy with its deployment behaviors for high-precision control, we perform online RL by learning a latent space noise predictor. With this pipeline, GR-RL is, to our knowledge, the first learning-based policy that can autonomously lace up a shoe by threading shoelaces through multiple eyelets with an 83.3% success rate, a task requiring long-horizon reasoning, millimeter-level precision, and compliant soft-body interaction. We hope GR-RL provides a step toward enabling generalist robot foundation models to specialize into reliable real-world experts.</p></details> |  |
| **[Diffusion Self-Weighted Guidance for Offline Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18345v2)** | 2025-12-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Offline reinforcement learning (RL) recovers the optimal policy $π$ given historical observations of an agent. In practice, $π$ is modeled as a weighted version of the agent's behavior policy $μ$, using a weight function $w$ working as a critic of the agent's behavior. Though recent approaches to offline RL based on diffusion models have exhibited promising results, the computation of the required scores is challenging due to their dependence on the unknown $w$. In this work, we alleviate this issue by constructing a diffusion over both the actions and the weights. With the proposed setting, the required scores are directly obtained from the diffusion model without learning extra networks. Our main conceptual contribution is a novel guidance method, where guidance (which is a function of $w$) comes from the same diffusion model, therefore, our proposal is termed Self-Weighted Guidance (SWG). We show that SWG generates samples from the desired distribution on toy examples and performs on par with state-of-the-art methods on D4RL's challenging environments, while maintaining a streamlined training pipeline. We further validate SWG through ablation studies on weight formulations and scalability.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in Transactions on Machine Learning Research (TMLR). 21 pages, 6 figures</p></details> |
| **[CORE: Compensable Reward as a Catalyst for Improving Offline RL in Wireless Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19671v1)** | 2025-12-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Real-world wireless data are expensive to collect and often lack sufficient expert demonstrations, causing existing offline RL methods to overfit suboptimal behaviors and exhibit unstable performance. To address this issue, we propose CORE, an offline RL framework specifically designed for wireless environments. CORE identifies latent expert trajectories from noisy datasets via behavior embedding clustering, and trains a conditional variational autoencoder with a contrastive objective to separate expert and non-expert behaviors in latent space. Based on the learned representations, CORE constructs compensable rewards that reflect expert-likelihood, effectively guiding policy learning under limited or imperfect supervision. More broadly, this work represents one of the early systematic explorations of offline RL in wireless networking, where prior adoption remains limited. Beyond introducing offline RL techniques to this domain, we further examine intrinsic wireless data characteristics and develop a domain-aligned algorithm that explicitly accounts for their structural properties. While offline RL has not yet been fully established as a standard methodology in the wireless community, our study aims to provide foundational insights and empirical evidence to support its broader acceptance.</p></details> |  |
| **[MOORL: A Framework for Integrating Offline-Online Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09574v2)** | 2025-12-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Sample efficiency and exploration remain critical challenges in Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL), particularly in complex domains. Offline RL, which enables agents to learn optimal policies from static, pre-collected datasets, has emerged as a promising alternative. However, offline RL is constrained by issues such as out-of-distribution (OOD) actions that limit policy performance and generalization. To overcome these limitations, we propose Meta Offline-Online Reinforcement Learning (MOORL), a hybrid framework that unifies offline and online RL for efficient and scalable learning. While previous hybrid methods rely on extensive design components and added computational complexity to utilize offline data effectively, MOORL introduces a meta-policy that seamlessly adapts across offline and online trajectories. This enables the agent to leverage offline data for robust initialization while utilizing online interactions to drive efficient exploration. Our theoretical analysis demonstrates that the hybrid approach enhances exploration by effectively combining the complementary strengths of offline and online data. Furthermore, we demonstrate that MOORL learns a stable Q-function without added complexity. Extensive experiments on 28 tasks from the D4RL and V-D4RL benchmarks validate its effectiveness, showing consistent improvements over state-of-the-art offline and hybrid RL baselines. With minimal computational overhead, MOORL achieves strong performance, underscoring its potential for practical applications in real-world scenarios.</p></details> |  |
| **[From Novelty to Imitation: Self-Distilled Rewards for Offline Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12815v2)** | 2025-12-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Offline Reinforcement Learning (RL) aims to learn effective policies from a static dataset without requiring further agent-environment interactions. However, its practical adoption is often hindered by the need for explicit reward annotations, which can be costly to engineer or difficult to obtain retrospectively. To address this, we propose ReLOAD (Reinforcement Learning with Offline Reward Annotation via Distillation), a novel reward annotation framework for offline RL. Unlike existing methods that depend on complex alignment procedures, our approach adapts Random Network Distillation (RND) to generate intrinsic rewards from expert demonstrations using a simple yet effective embedding discrepancy measure. First, we train a predictor network to mimic a fixed target network's embeddings based on expert state transitions. Later, the prediction error between these networks serves as a reward signal for each transition in the static dataset. This mechanism provides a structured reward signal without requiring handcrafted reward annotations. We provide a formal theoretical construct that offers insights into how RND prediction errors effectively serve as intrinsic rewards by distinguishing expert-like transitions. Experiments on the D4RL benchmark demonstrate that ReLOAD enables robust offline policy learning and achieves performance competitive with traditional reward-annotated methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[Offline Reinforcement Learning for End-to-End Autonomous Driving](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18662v1)** | 2025-12-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>End-to-end (E2E) autonomous driving models that take only camera images as input and directly predict a future trajectory are appealing for their computational efficiency and potential for improved generalization via unified optimization; however, persistent failure modes remain due to reliance on imitation learning (IL). While online reinforcement learning (RL) could mitigate IL-induced issues, the computational burden of neural rendering-based simulation and large E2E networks renders iterative reward and hyperparameter tuning costly. We introduce a camera-only E2E offline RL framework that performs no additional exploration and trains solely on a fixed simulator dataset. Offline RL offers strong data efficiency and rapid experimental iteration, yet is susceptible to instability from overestimation on out-of-distribution (OOD) actions. To address this, we construct pseudo ground-truth trajectories from expert driving logs and use them as a behavior regularization signal, suppressing imitation of unsafe or suboptimal behavior while stabilizing value learning. Training and closed-loop evaluation are conducted in a neural rendering environment learned from the public nuScenes dataset. Empirically, the proposed method achieves substantial improvements in collision rate and route completion compared with IL baselines. Our code will be available at [URL].</p></details> | 15 pages |
| **[ASTRO: Adaptive Stitching via Dynamics-Guided Trajectory Rollouts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.23442v2)** | 2025-12-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Offline reinforcement learning (RL) enables agents to learn optimal policies from pre-collected datasets. However, datasets containing suboptimal and fragmented trajectories present challenges for reward propagation, resulting in inaccurate value estimation and degraded policy performance. While trajectory stitching via generative models offers a promising solution, existing augmentation methods frequently produce trajectories that are either confined to the support of the behavior policy or violate the underlying dynamics, thereby limiting their effectiveness for policy improvement. We propose ASTRO, a data augmentation framework that generates distributionally novel and dynamics-consistent trajectories for offline RL. ASTRO first learns a temporal-distance representation to identify distinct and reachable stitch targets. We then employ a dynamics-guided stitch planner that adaptively generates connecting action sequences via Rollout Deviation Feedback, defined as the gap between target state sequence and the actual arrived state sequence by executing predicted actions, to improve trajectory stitching's feasibility and reachability. This approach facilitates effective augmentation through stitching and ultimately enhances policy learning. ASTRO outperforms prior offline RL augmentation methods across various algorithms, achieving notable performance gain on the challenging OGBench suite and demonstrating consistent improvements on standard offline RL benchmarks such as D4RL.</p></details> |  |
| **[PrivORL: Differentially Private Synthetic Dataset for Offline Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07342v2)** | 2025-12-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, offline reinforcement learning (RL) has become a popular RL paradigm. In offline RL, data providers share pre-collected datasets -- either as individual transitions or sequences of transitions forming trajectories -- to enable the training of RL models (also called agents) without direct interaction with the environments. Offline RL saves interactions with environments compared to traditional RL, and has been effective in critical areas, such as navigation tasks. Meanwhile, concerns about privacy leakage from offline RL datasets have emerged. To safeguard private information in offline RL datasets, we propose the first differential privacy (DP) offline dataset synthesis method, PrivORL, which leverages a diffusion model and diffusion transformer to synthesize transitions and trajectories, respectively, under DP. The synthetic dataset can then be securely released for downstream analysis and research. PrivORL adopts the popular approach of pre-training a synthesizer on public datasets, and then fine-tuning on sensitive datasets using DP Stochastic Gradient Descent (DP-SGD). Additionally, PrivORL introduces curiosity-driven pre-training, which uses feedback from the curiosity module to diversify the synthetic dataset and thus can generate diverse synthetic transitions and trajectories that closely resemble the sensitive dataset. Extensive experiments on five sensitive offline RL datasets show that our method achieves better utility and fidelity in both DP transition and trajectory synthesis compared to baselines. The replication package is available at the GitHub repository.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at NDSS 2026; code available at https://github.com/2019ChenGong/PrivORL</p></details> |

While existing Safe Offline RL methods typically enforce soft expected-cost constraints, they do not guarantee forward invariance. Conversely, Control Barrier Functions (CBFs) provide rigorous safety guarantees but usually depend on expert-designed barrier functions or full knowledge of the system dynamics. We introduce Value-Guided Offline Control Barrier Functions (V-OCBF), a framework that learns a neural CBF entirely from offline demonstrations. Unlike prior approaches, V-OCBF does not assume access to the dynamics model; instead, it derives a recursive finite-difference barrier update, enabling model-free learning of a barrier that propagates safety information over time. Moreover, V-OCBF incorporates an expectile-based objective that avoids querying the barrier on out-of-distribution actions and restricts updates to the dataset-supported action set. The learned barrier is then used with a Quadratic Program (QP) formulation to synthesize real-time safe control. Across multiple case studies, V-OCBF yields substantially fewer safety violations than baseline methods while maintaining strong task performance, highlighting its scalability for offline synthesis of safety-critical controllers without online interaction or hand-engineered barriers.</p></details> | <details><summary>23 pa...</summary><p>23 pages, 8 figure, 7 tables</p></details> |
| **[Latent Action World Models for Control with Unlabeled Trajectories](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10016v1)** | 2025-12-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Inspired by how humans combine direct interaction with action-free experience (e.g., videos), we study world models that learn from heterogeneous data. Standard world models typically rely on action-conditioned trajectories, which limits effectiveness when action labels are scarce. We introduce a family of latent-action world models that jointly use action-conditioned and action-free data by learning a shared latent action representation. This latent space aligns observed control signals with actions inferred from passive observations, enabling a single dynamics model to train on large-scale unlabeled trajectories while requiring only a small set of action-labeled ones. We use the latent-action world model to learn a latent-action policy through offline reinforcement learning (RL), thereby bridging two traditionally separate domains: offline RL, which typically relies on action-conditioned data, and action-free training, which is rarely used with subsequent RL. On the DeepMind Control Suite, our approach achieves strong performance while using about an order of magnitude fewer action-labeled samples than purely action-conditioned baselines. These results show that latent actions enable training on both passive and interactive data, which makes world models learn more efficiently.</p></details> |  |
| **[Scalable Offline Model-Based RL with Action Chunks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08108v1)** | 2025-12-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we study whether model-based reinforcement learning (RL), in particular model-based value expansion, can provide a scalable recipe for tackling complex, long-horizon tasks in offline RL. Model-based value expansion fits an on-policy value function using length-n imaginary rollouts generated by the current policy and a learned dynamics model. While larger n reduces bias in value bootstrapping, it amplifies accumulated model errors over long horizons, degrading future predictions. We address this trade-off with an \emph{action-chunk} model that predicts a future state from a sequence of actions (an "action chunk") instead of a single action, which reduces compounding errors. In addition, instead of directly training a policy to maximize rewards, we employ rejection sampling from an expressive behavioral action-chunk policy, which prevents model exploitation from out-of-distribution actions. We call this recipe \textbf{Model-Based RL with Action Chunks (MAC)}. Through experiments on highly challenging tasks with large-scale datasets of up to 100M transitions, we show that MAC achieves the best performance among offline model-based RL algorithms, especially on challenging long-horizon tasks.</p></details> | 22 pages, 7 figures |
| **[RAMAC: Multimodal Risk-Aware Offline Reinforcement Learning and the Role of Behavior Regularization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02695v2)** | 2025-12-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In safety-critical domains where online data collection is infeasible, offline reinforcement learning (RL) offers an attractive alternative but only if policies deliver high returns without incurring catastrophic lower-tail risk. Prior work on risk-averse offline RL achieves safety at the cost of value or model-based pessimism, and restricted policy classes that limit policy expressiveness, whereas diffusion/flow-based expressive generative policies trained with a behavioral-cloning (BC) objective have been used only in risk-neutral settings. Here, we address this gap by introducing the \textbf{Risk-Aware Multimodal Actor-Critic (RAMAC)}, which couples an expressive generative actor with a distributional critic and, to our knowledge, is the first model-free approach that learns \emph{risk-aware expressive generative policies}. RAMAC differentiates a composite objective that adds a Conditional Value-at-Risk (CVaR) term to a BC loss, achieving risk-sensitive learning in complex multimodal scenarios. Since out-of-distribution (OOD) actions are a major driver of catastrophic failures in offline RL, we further analyze OOD behavior under prior-anchored perturbation schemes from recent BC-regularized risk-averse offline RL. This clarifies why a behavior-regularized objective that directly constrains the expressive generative policy to the dataset support provides an effective, risk-agnostic mechanism for suppressing OOD actions in modern expressive policies. We instantiate RAMAC with a diffusion-based actor, using it both to illustrate the analysis in a 2-D risky bandit and to deploy OOD-action detectors on Stochastic-D4RL benchmarks, empirically validating our insights. Across these tasks, we observe consistent gains in $\mathrm{CVaR}_{0.1}$ while maintaining strong returns. Our implementation is available at GitHub: https://github.com/KaiFukazawa/RAMAC.git</p></details> |  |
| **[Data Fusion-Enhanced Decision Transformer for Stable Cross-Domain Generalization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09173v2)** | 2025-12-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Cross-domain shifts present a significant challenge for decision transformer (DT) policies. Existing cross-domain policy adaptation methods typically rely on a single simple filtering criterion to select source trajectory fragments and stitch them together. They match either state structure or action feasibility. However, the selected fragments still have poor stitchability: state structures can misalign, the return-to-go (RTG) becomes incomparable when the reward or horizon changes, and actions may jump at trajectory junctions. As a result, RTG tokens lose continuity, which compromises DT's inference ability. To tackle these challenges, we propose Data Fusion-Enhanced Decision Transformer (DFDT), a compact pipeline that restores stitchability. Particularly, DFDT fuses scarce target data with selectively trusted source fragments via a two-level data filter, maximum mean discrepancy (MMD) mismatch for state-structure alignment, and optimal transport (OT) deviation for action feasibility. It then trains on a feasibility-weighted fusion distribution. Furthermore, DFDT replaces RTG tokens with advantage-conditioned tokens, which improves the continuity of the semantics in the token sequence. It also applies a $Q$-guided regularizer to suppress junction value and action jumps. Theoretically, we provide bounds that tie state value and policy performance gaps to the MMD-mismatch and OT-deviation measures, and show that the bounds tighten as these two measures shrink. We show that DFDT improves return and stability over strong offline RL and sequence-model baselines across gravity, kinematic, and morphology shifts on D4RL-style control tasks, and further corroborate these gains with token-stitching and sequence-semantics stability analyses.</p></details> | 32 pages,4 figures |
| **[State Diversity Matters in Offline Behavior Distillation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06692v1)** | 2025-12-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Offline Behavior Distillation (OBD), which condenses massive offline RL data into a compact synthetic behavioral dataset, offers a promising approach for efficient policy training and can be applied across various downstream RL tasks. In this paper, we uncover a misalignment between original and distilled datasets, observing that a high-quality original dataset does not necessarily yield a superior synthetic dataset. Through an empirical analysis of policy performance under varying levels of training loss, we show that datasets with greater state diversity outperforms those with higher state quality when training loss is substantial, as is often the case in OBD, whereas the relationship reverses under minimal loss, which contributes to the misalignment. By associating state quality and diversity in reducing pivotal and surrounding error, respectively, our theoretical analysis establishes that surrounding error plays a more crucial role in policy performance when pivotal error is large, thereby highlighting the importance of state diversity in OBD scenario. Furthermore, we propose a novel yet simple algorithm, state density weighted (SDW) OBD, which emphasizes state diversity by weighting the distillation objective using the reciprocal of state density, thereby distilling a more diverse state information into synthetic data. Extensive experiments across multiple D4RL datasets confirm that SDW significantly enhances OBD performance when the original dataset exhibits limited state diversity.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 5 figures, 5 tables</p></details> |

However, existing offline RL methods often assume stationarity or only consider synthetic perturbations at test time, assumptions that often fail in real-world scenarios characterized by abrupt, time-varying offsets. These offsets can lead to partial observability, causing agents to misperceive their true state and degrade performance. To overcome this challenge, we introduce Forecasting in Non-stationary Offline RL (FORL), a framework that unifies (i) conditional diffusion-based candidate state generation, trained without presupposing any specific pattern of future non-stationarity, and (ii) zero-shot time-series foundation models. FORL targets environments prone to unexpected, potentially non-Markovian offsets, requiring robust agent performance from the onset of each episode. Empirical evaluations on offline RL benchmarks, augmented with real-world time-series data to simulate realistic non-stationarity, demonstrate that FORL consistently improves performance compared to competitive baselines. By integrating zero-shot forecasting with the agent's experience, we aim to bridge the gap between offline RL and the complexities of real-world, non-stationary environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>The T...</summary><p>The Thirty-Ninth Annual Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems, NeurIPS 2025</p></details> |
| **[Dual-Robust Cross-Domain Offline Reinforcement Learning Against Dynamics Shifts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02486v1)** | 2025-12-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Single-domain offline reinforcement learning (RL) often suffers from limited data coverage, while cross-domain offline RL handles this issue by leveraging additional data from other domains with dynamics shifts. However, existing studies primarily focus on train-time robustness (handling dynamics shifts from training data), neglecting the test-time robustness against dynamics perturbations when deployed in practical scenarios. In this paper, we investigate dual (both train-time and test-time) robustness against dynamics shifts in cross-domain offline RL. We first empirically show that the policy trained with cross-domain offline RL exhibits fragility under dynamics perturbations during evaluation, particularly when target domain data is limited. To address this, we introduce a novel robust cross-domain Bellman (RCB) operator, which enhances test-time robustness against dynamics perturbations while staying conservative to the out-of-distribution dynamics transitions, thus guaranteeing the train-time robustness. To further counteract potential value overestimation or underestimation caused by the RCB operator, we introduce two techniques, the dynamic value penalty and the Huber loss, into our framework, resulting in the practical \textbf{D}ual-\textbf{RO}bust \textbf{C}ross-domain \textbf{O}ffline RL (DROCO) algorithm. Extensive empirical results across various dynamics shift scenarios show that DROCO outperforms strong baselines and exhibits enhanced robustness to dynamics perturbations.</p></details> |  |

This paper is the first to study the open question of symmetric regularization. We show that symmetric regularization does not permit an analytic optimal policy $π^*$, posing a challenge to practical utility of symmetric BRPO. We approximate $π^*$ by the Taylor series of Pearson-Vajda $χ^n$ divergences and show that an analytic policy expression exists only when the series is capped at $n=5$. To compute the solution in a numerically stable manner, we propose to Taylor expand the conditional symmetry term of the symmetric divergence loss, leading to a novel algorithm: Symmetric $f$-Actor Critic (S$f$-AC). S$f$-AC achieves consistently strong results across various D4RL MuJoCo tasks. Additionally, S$f$-AC avoids per-environment failures observed in IQL, SQL, XQL and AWAC, opening up possibilities for more diverse and effective regularization choices for offline RL.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we develop and analyze an efficient dataset distillation algorithm for supervised learning, specifically regression in $\mathbb{R}^d$, based on matching the losses on the training and synthetic datasets with respect to a fixed set of randomly sampled regressors without any model training. Our first key contribution is a novel performance guarantee proving that our algorithm needs only $\tilde{O}(d^2)$ sampled regressors to derive a synthetic dataset on which the MSE loss of any bounded linear model is nearly the same as its MSE loss on the given training data. In particular, the model optimized on the synthetic data has close to minimum loss on the training data, thus performing nearly as well as the model optimized on the latter. Complementing this, we also prove a matching lower bound of $Ω(d^2)$ for the number of sampled regressors showing the tightness of our analysis. Our second contribution is to extend our algorithm to offline RL dataset distillation by matching the Bellman loss, unlike previous works which used a behavioral cloning objective. This is the first such method which leverages both, the rewards and the next state information, available in offline RL datasets, without any policy model optimization. Our algorithm generates a synthetic dataset whose Bellman loss with respect to any linear action-value predictor is close to the latter's Bellman loss on the offline RL training dataset. Therefore, a policy associated with an action-value predictor optimized on the synthetic dataset performs nearly as well as that derived from the one optimized on the training data. We conduct experiments to validate our theoretical guarantees and observe performance gains.</p></details> | 29 pages, 2 figures |

This is feasible because an online learning agent can repurpose its historical interactions as offline dataset. We formalize this idea into a framework that accommodates several variants of offline RL incorporation such as final policy recommendation and online fine-tuning. We further introduce convenient techniques to improve its effectiveness in enhancing online learning efficiency. Our extensive and systematic empirical analyses show that 1) the effectiveness of the proposed framework depends strongly on the nature of the task, 2) our proposed techniques greatly enhance its effectiveness, and 3) existing online fine-tuning methods are overall ineffective, calling for more research therein.</p></details> |  |

We propose BiCQL-ML, a policy-free offline IRL algorithm that jointly optimizes a reward function and a conservative Q-function in a bi-level framework, thereby avoiding explicit policy learning. The method alternates between (i) learning a conservative Q-function via Conservative Q-Learning (CQL) under the current reward, and (ii) updating the reward parameters to maximize the expected Q-values of expert actions while suppressing over-generalization to out-of-distribution actions. This procedure can be viewed as maximum likelihood estimation under a soft value matching principle. We provide theoretical guarantees that BiCQL-ML converges to a reward function under which the expert policy is soft-optimal. Empirically, we show on standard offline RL benchmarks that BiCQL-ML improves both reward recovery and downstream policy performance compared to existing offline IRL baselines.</p></details> | 8 pages, 3 figures |

Although concerns have been raised regarding the coarseness of this time-step size, which might distort patient dynamics and lead to suboptimal treatment policies, the extent to which this is a problem in practice remains unexplored. In this work, we conducted empirical experiments for a controlled comparison of four time-step sizes ($Δt\!=\!1,2,4,8$ h) on this domain, following an identical offline RL pipeline. To enable a fair comparison across time-step sizes, we designed action re-mapping methods that allow for evaluation of policies on datasets with different time-step sizes, and conducted cross-$Δt$ model selections under two policy learning setups. Our goal was to quantify how time-step size influences state representation learning, behavior cloning, policy training, and off-policy evaluation. Our results show that performance trends across $Δt$ vary as learning setups change, while policies learned at finer time-step sizes ($Δt = 1$ h and $2$ h) using a static behavior policy achieve the overall best performance and stability. Our work highlights time-step size as a core design choice in offline RL for healthcare and provides evidence supporting alternatives beyond the conventional 4-hour setup.</p></details> |  |

We propose an end-to-end offline RL framework for dual vasopressor administration in Intensive Care Units (ICUs) that directly addresses this challenge through principled action space design. Our method integrates discrete, continuous, and directional dosing strategies with conservative Q-learning and incorporates a novel recurrent modeling using a replay buffer to capture temporal dependencies in ICU time-series data. Our comparative analysis of norepinephrine dosing strategies across different action space formulations reveals that the designed action spaces improve interpretability and facilitate clinical adoption while preserving efficacy. Empirical results on eICU and MIMIC demonstrate that action space design profoundly influences learned behavioral policies. Compared with baselines, the proposed methods achieve more than 3x expected reward improvements, while aligning with established clinical protocols.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 5 figures.

However, the individual experts may be privacy-sensitive in that the learnt policy may retain information about their precise choices. In some domains like personalized retrieval, advertising and healthcare, the expert choices are considered sensitive data. To provably protect the privacy of such experts, we propose a novel consensus-based expert-level differentially private offline RL training approach compatible with any existing offline RL algorithm. We prove rigorous differential privacy guarantees, while maintaining strong empirical performance. Unlike existing work in differentially private RL, we supplement the theory with proof-of-concept experiments on classic RL environments featuring large continuous state spaces, demonstrating substantial improvements over a natural baseline across multiple tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Top 1...</summary><p>Top 10% submission at TMLR (J2C Certification)</p></details> |
| **[A Comparison Between Decision Transformers and Traditional Offline Reinforcement Learning Algorithms](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16475v1)** | 2025-11-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The field of Offline Reinforcement Learning (RL) aims to derive effective policies from pre-collected datasets without active environment interaction. While traditional offline RL algorithms like Conservative Q-Learning (CQL) and Implicit Q-Learning (IQL) have shown promise, they often face challenges in balancing exploration and exploitation, especially in environments with varying reward densities. The recently proposed Decision Transformer (DT) approach, which reframes offline RL as a sequence modelling problem, has demonstrated impressive results across various benchmarks. This paper presents a comparative study evaluating the performance of DT against traditional offline RL algorithms in dense and sparse reward settings for the ANT continous control environment. Our research investigates how these algorithms perform when faced with different reward structures, examining their ability to learn effective policies and generalize across varying levels of feedback. Through empirical analysis in the ANT environment, we found that DTs showed less sensitivity to varying reward density compared to other methods and particularly excelled with medium-expert datasets in sparse reward scenarios. In contrast, traditional value-based methods like IQL showed improved performance in dense reward settings with high-quality data, while CQL offered balanced performance across different data qualities. Additionally, DTs exhibited lower variance in performance but required significantly more computational resources compared to traditional approaches. These findings suggest that sequence modelling approaches may be more suitable for scenarios with uncertain reward structures or mixed-quality data, while value-based methods remain competitive in settings with dense rewards and high-quality demonstrations.</p></details> | <details><summary>15 pa...</summary><p>15 pages, 4 figures, published in the Proceedings of the 46th Annual conference of the South African Institute of Computer Scientists and Information Technologists (SIACSIT 2025)</p></details> |

This study introduces DeepEN, a reinforcement learning (RL)-based framework that personalizes enteral nutrition (EN) dosing for critically ill patients using electronic health record data. DeepEN was trained on over 11,000 ICU patients from the MIMIC-IV database to generate 4-hourly, patient-specific targets for caloric, protein, and fluid intake. The model's state space integrates demographics, comorbidities, vital signs, laboratory results, and prior interventions relevant to nutritional management, while its reward function balances short-term physiological and nutrition-related goals with long-term survival. A dueling double deep Q-network with Conservative Q-Learning regularization is used to ensure safe and reliable policy learning from retrospective data. DeepEN achieved a 3.7 $\pm$ 0.17 percentage-point absolute reduction in estimated mortality compared with the clinician policy (18.8% vs 22.5%) and higher expected returns compared with guideline-based dosing (11.89 vs 8.11), with improvements in key nutritional biomarkers. U-shaped associations between deviations from clinician dosing and mortality suggest that the learned policy aligns with high-value clinician actions while diverging from suboptimal ones. These findings demonstrate the feasibility of conservative offline RL for individualized EN therapy and suggest that data-driven personalization may improve outcomes beyond guideline- or heuristic-based approaches.</p></details> |  |

We present a general-purpose method, RL with Experience and Corrections via Advantage-conditioned Policies (RECAP), that provides for RL training of VLAs via advantage conditioning. Our method incorporates heterogeneous data into the self-improvement process, including demonstrations, data from on-policy collection, and expert teleoperated interventions provided during autonomous execution. RECAP starts by pre-training a generalist VLA with offline RL, which we call $π^{*}_{0.6}$, that can then be specialized to attain high performance on downstream tasks through on-robot data collection. We show that the $π^{*}_{0.6}$ model trained with the full RECAP method can fold laundry in real homes, reliably assemble boxes, and make espresso drinks using a professional espresso machine. On some of the hardest tasks, RECAP more than doubles task throughput and roughly halves the task failure rate.</p></details> |  |

Recent research has shown that incorporating intrinsic motivation mechanisms into EDTs improves performance across exploration tasks, yet the representational mechanisms underlying these improvements remain unexplored. In this paper, we introduce a systematic post-hoc explainability framework to analyze how intrinsic motivation shapes learned embeddings in EDTs. Through statistical analysis of embedding properties (including covariance structure, vector magnitudes, and orthogonality), we reveal that different intrinsic motivation variants create fundamentally different representational structures. Our analysis demonstrates environment-specific correlation patterns between embedding metrics and performance that explain why intrinsic motivation improves policy learning. These findings show that intrinsic motivation operates beyond simple exploration bonuses, acting as a representational prior that shapes embedding geometry in biologically plausible ways, creating environment-specific organizational structures that facilitate better decision-making.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for poster presentation at the NeurIPS 2025 workshop "CogInterp: Interpreting Cognition in Deep Learning Models", San Diego, CA, USA</p></details> |

While reinforcement learning (RL) offers a promising approach for optimizing ATS, its conventional online trial-and-error learning mechanism is not permissible in clinical settings due to risks of harm to patients. Offline RL tackles this limitation by learning policies exclusively from historical treatment data, but its performance is often constrained by data scarcity-a pervasive challenge in clinical domains. To overcome this, we propose Treatment Stitching (TreatStitch), a novel data augmentation framework that generates clinically valid treatment trajectories by intelligently stitching segments from existing treatment data. Specifically, TreatStitch identifies similar intermediate patient states across different trajectories and stitches their respective segments. Even when intermediate states are too dissimilar to stitch directly, TreatStitch leverages the Schrödinger bridge method to generate smooth and energy-efficient bridging trajectories that connect dissimilar states. By augmenting these synthetic trajectories into the original dataset, offline RL can learn from a more diverse dataset, thereby improving its ability to optimize ATS. Extensive experiments across multiple treatment datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of TreatStitch in enhancing offline RL performance. Furthermore, we provide a theoretical justification showing that TreatStitch maintains clinical validity by avoiding out-of-distribution transitions.</p></details> | <details><summary>19 pa...</summary><p>19 pages, 5 figures, AAAI conference</p></details> |

Extreme $Q$-Learning (XQL) is a recent offline RL method that models Bellman errors using the Extreme Value Theorem, yielding strong empirical performance. However, XQL and its stabilized variant MXQL suffer from notable limitations: both require extensive hyperparameter tuning specific to each dataset and domain, and also exhibit instability during training. To address these issues, we proposed a principled method to estimate the temperature coefficient $β$ via quantile regression under mild assumptions. To further improve training stability, we introduce a value regularization technique with mild generalization, inspired by recent advances in constrained value learning. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm achieves competitive or superior performance across a range of benchmark tasks, including D4RL and NeoRL2, while maintaining stable training dynamics and using a consistent set of hyperparameters across all datasets and domains.</p></details> |  |

We posit this failure stems from data corruption creating sharp minima in the loss landscape, leading to poor generalization. To address this, we are the first to apply Sharpness-Aware Minimization (SAM) as a general-purpose, plug-and-play optimizer for offline RL. SAM seeks flatter minima, guiding models to more robust parameter regions. We integrate SAM into strong baselines for data corruption: IQL, a top-performing offline RL algorithm in this setting, and RIQL, an algorithm designed specifically for data-corruption robustness. We evaluate them on D4RL benchmarks with both random and adversarial corruption. Our SAM-enhanced methods consistently and significantly outperform the original baselines. Visualizations of the reward surface confirm that SAM finds smoother solutions, providing strong evidence for its effectiveness in improving the robustness of offline RL agents.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted as an Oral Presentation at the AAAI 2026 Student Abstract and Poster Program (SAPP)</p></details> |
| **[Provable Domain Adaptation for Offline Reinforcement Learning with Limited Samples](https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12136v4)** | 2025-11-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Offline reinforcement learning (RL) learns effective policies from a static target dataset. The performance of state-of-the-art offline RL algorithms notwithstanding, it relies on the size of the target dataset, and it degrades if limited samples in the target dataset are available, which is often the case in real-world applications. To address this issue, domain adaptation that leverages auxiliary samples from related source datasets (such as simulators) can be beneficial. However, establishing the optimal way to trade off the limited target dataset and the large-but-biased source dataset while ensuring provably theoretical guarantees remains an open challenge. To the best of our knowledge, this paper proposes the first framework that theoretically explores the impact of the weights assigned to each dataset on the performance of offline RL. In particular, we establish performance bounds and the existence of the optimal weight, which can be computed in closed form under simplifying assumptions. We also provide algorithmic guarantees in terms of convergence to a neighborhood of the optimum. Notably, these results depend on the quality of the source dataset and the number of samples in the target dataset. Our empirical results on the well-known offline Procgen benchmark substantiate the theoretical contributions in this work.</p></details> |  |
| **[Improved Offline Reinforcement Learning via Quantum Metric Encoding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10187v1)** | 2025-11-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement learning (RL) with limited samples is common in real-world applications. However, offline RL performance under this constraint is often suboptimal. We consider an alternative approach to dealing with limited samples by introducing the Quantum Metric Encoder (QME). In this methodology, instead of applying the RL framework directly on the original states and rewards, we embed the states into a more compact and meaningful representation, where the structure of the encoding is inspired by quantum circuits. For classical data, QME is a classically simulable, trainable unitary embedding and thus serves as a quantum-inspired module, on a classical device. For quantum data in the form of quantum states, QME can be implemented directly on quantum hardware, allowing for training without measurement or re-encoding. We evaluated QME on three datasets, each limited to 100 samples. We use Soft-Actor-Critic (SAC) and Implicit-Q-Learning (IQL), two well-known RL algorithms, to demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. From the experimental results, we find that training offline RL agents on QME-embedded states with decoded rewards yields significantly better performance than training on the original states and rewards. On average across the three datasets, for maximum reward performance, we achieve a 116.2% improvement for SAC and 117.6% for IQL. We further investigate the $Δ$-hyperbolicity of our framework, a geometric property of the state space known to be important for the RL training efficacy. The QME-embedded states exhibit low $Δ$-hyperbolicity, suggesting that the improvement after embedding arises from the modified geometry of the state space induced by QME. Thus, the low $Δ$-hyperbolicity and the corresponding effectiveness of QME could provide valuable information for developing efficient offline RL methods under limited-sample conditions.</p></details> |  |
| **[Diffusion Policies with Value-Conditional Optimization for Offline Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08922v1)** | 2025-11-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In offline reinforcement learning, value overestimation caused by out-of-distribution (OOD) actions significantly limits policy performance. Recently, diffusion models have been leveraged for their strong distribution-matching capabilities, enforcing conservatism through behavior policy constraints. However, existing methods often apply indiscriminate regularization to redundant actions in low-quality datasets, resulting in excessive conservatism and an imbalance between the expressiveness and efficiency of diffusion modeling. To address these issues, we propose DIffusion policies with Value-conditional Optimization (DIVO), a novel approach that leverages diffusion models to generate high-quality, broadly covered in-distribution state-action samples while facilitating efficient policy improvement. Specifically, DIVO introduces a binary-weighted mechanism that utilizes the advantage values of actions in the offline dataset to guide diffusion model training. This enables a more precise alignment with the dataset's distribution while selectively expanding the boundaries of high-advantage actions. During policy improvement, DIVO dynamically filters high-return-potential actions from the diffusion model, effectively guiding the learned policy toward better performance. This approach achieves a critical balance between conservatism and explorability in offline RL. We evaluate DIVO on the D4RL benchmark and compare it against state-of-the-art baselines. Empirical results demonstrate that DIVO achieves superior performance, delivering significant improvements in average returns across locomotion tasks and outperforming existing methods in the challenging AntMaze domain, where sparse rewards pose a major difficulty.</p></details> | IROS 2025 |
| **[Bayes Adaptive Monte Carlo Tree Search for Offline Model-based Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11234v3)** | 2025-11-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Offline RL is a powerful approach for data-driven decision-making and control. Compared to model-free methods, offline model-based RL (MBRL) explicitly learns world models from a static dataset and uses them as surrogate simulators, improving the data efficiency and enabling the learned policy to potentially generalize beyond the dataset support. However, there could be various MDPs that behave identically on the offline dataset and dealing with the uncertainty about the true MDP can be challenging. In this paper, we propose modeling offline MBRL as a Bayes Adaptive Markov Decision Process (BAMDP), which is a principled framework for addressing model uncertainty. We further propose a novel Bayes Adaptive Monte-Carlo planning algorithm capable of solving BAMDPs in continuous state and action spaces with stochastic transitions. This planning process is based on Monte Carlo Tree Search and can be integrated into offline MBRL as a policy improvement operator in policy iteration. Our ``RL + Search" framework follows in the footsteps of superhuman AIs like AlphaZero, improving on current offline MBRL methods by incorporating more computation input. The proposed algorithm significantly outperforms state-of-the-art offline RL methods on twelve D4RL MuJoCo tasks and three target tracking tasks in a challenging, stochastic tokamak control simulator.

MCS devices are percutaneous micro-axial flow pumps that provide left ventricular unloading and forward blood flow, but current weaning strategies vary significantly across care teams and lack data-driven approaches. Offline reinforcement learning (RL) has proven to be successful in sequential decision-making tasks, but our setting presents challenges for training and evaluating traditional offline RL methods: prohibition of online patient interaction, highly uncertain circulatory dynamics due to concurrent treatments, and limited data availability. We developed an end-to-end machine learning framework with two key contributions (1) Clinically-aware OOD-regularized Model-based Policy Optimization (CORMPO), a density-regularized offline RL algorithm for out-of-distribution suppression that also incorporates clinically-informed reward shaping and (2) a Transformer-based probabilistic digital twin that models MCS circulatory dynamics for policy evaluation with rich physiological and clinical metrics. We prove that \textsf{CORMPO} achieves theoretical performance guarantees under mild assumptions. CORMPO attains a higher reward than the offline RL baselines by 28% and higher scores in clinical metrics by 82.6% on real and synthetic datasets. Our approach offers a principled framework for safe offline policy learning in high-stakes medical applications where domain expertise and safety constraints are essential.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we introduce a new reasoning data generation framework spanning diverse skills and levels of complexity with over 1M high-quality synthetic vision-centric questions. The dataset also includes preference data and instruction prompts supporting both offline and online RL. Our synthesis framework proceeds in two stages: (1) scale; and (2) complexity. Reasoning traces are then synthesized through a two-stage process that leverages VLMs and reasoning LLMs, producing CoT traces for VLMs that capture the richness and diverse cognitive behaviors found in frontier reasoning models. Remarkably, we show that finetuning Qwen2.5-VL-7B on our data outperforms all open-data baselines across all evaluated vision-centric benchmarks, and even surpasses strong closed-data models such as MiMo-VL-7B-RL on V* Bench, CV-Bench and MMStar-V. Perhaps most surprising, despite being entirely vision-centric, our data transfers positively to text-only reasoning (MMLU-Pro) and audio reasoning (MMAU), demonstrating its effectiveness. Similarly, despite not containing videos or embodied visual data, we observe notable gains when evaluating on a single-evidence embodied QA benchmark (NiEH). Finally, we use our data to analyze the entire VLM post-training pipeline. Our empirical analysis highlights that (i) SFT on high-quality data with non-linear reasoning traces is essential for effective online RL, (ii) staged offline RL matches online RL's performance while reducing compute demands, and (iii) careful SFT on high quality data can substantially improve out-of-domain, cross-modality transfer.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://nvlabs.github.io/LongGroundedThoughts/</p></details> |

However, it is unclear how to recover the implicit policy from the learned implicit Q-function and why IQL can utilize weighted regression for policy extraction. IDQL reinterprets IQL as an actor-critic method and gets weights of implicit policy, however, this weight only holds for the optimal value function. In this work, we introduce a different way to solve the implicit policy-finding problem (IPF) by formulating this problem as an optimization problem. Based on this optimization problem, we further propose two practical algorithms AlignIQL and AlignIQL-hard, which inherit the advantages of decoupling actor from critic in IQL and provide insights into why IQL can use weighted regression for policy extraction. Compared with IQL and IDQL, we find our method keeps the simplicity of IQL and solves the implicit policy-finding problem. Experimental results on D4RL datasets show that our method achieves competitive or superior results compared with other SOTA offline RL methods. Especially in complex sparse reward tasks like Antmaze and Adroit, our method outperforms IQL and IDQL by a significant margin.</p></details> | <details><summary>32 pa...</summary><p>32 pages, 1 figure, 13 tables</p></details> |

To address this, offline RL algorithms typically impose constraints on action selection, which can be systematically categorized into density, support, and sample constraints. However, we show that each category has inherent limitations: density and sample constraints tend to be overly conservative in many scenarios, while the support constraint, though least restrictive, faces challenges in accurately modeling the behavior policy. To overcome these limitations, we propose a new neighborhood constraint that restricts action selection in the Bellman target to the union of neighborhoods of dataset actions. Theoretically, the constraint not only bounds extrapolation errors and distribution shift under certain conditions, but also approximates the support constraint without requiring behavior policy modeling. Moreover, it retains substantial flexibility and enables pointwise conservatism by adapting the neighborhood radius for each data point. In practice, we employ data quality as the adaptation criterion and design an adaptive neighborhood constraint. Building on an efficient bilevel optimization framework, we develop a simple yet effective algorithm, Adaptive Neighborhood-constrained Q learning (ANQ), to perform Q learning with target actions satisfying this constraint. Empirically, ANQ achieves state-of-the-art performance on standard offline RL benchmarks and exhibits strong robustness in scenarios with noisy or limited data.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to NeurIPS 2025 (Spotlight)</p></details> |
| **[Dense and Diverse Goal Coverage in Multi Goal Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25311v1)** | 2025-10-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement Learning algorithms are primarily focused on learning a policy that maximizes expected return. As a result, the learned policy can exploit one or few reward sources. However, in many natural situations, it is desirable to learn a policy that induces a dispersed marginal state distribution over rewarding states, while maximizing the expected return which is typically tied to reaching a goal state. This aspect remains relatively unexplored. Existing techniques based on entropy regularization and intrinsic rewards use stochasticity for encouraging exploration to find an optimal policy which may not necessarily lead to dispersed marginal state distribution over rewarding states. Other RL algorithms which match a target distribution assume the latter to be available apriori. This may be infeasible in large scale systems where enumeration of all states is not possible and a state is determined to be a goal state only upon reaching it. We formalize the problem of maximizing the expected return while uniformly visiting the goal states as Multi Goal RL in which an oracle classifier over the state space determines the goal states. We propose a novel algorithm that learns a high-return policy mixture with marginal state distribution dispersed over the set of goal states. Our algorithm is based on optimizing a custom RL reward which is computed - based on the current policy mixture - at each iteration for a set of sampled trajectories. The latter are used via an offline RL algorithm to update the policy mixture. We prove performance guarantees for our algorithm, showing efficient convergence bounds for optimizing a natural objective which captures the expected return as well as the dispersion of the marginal state distribution over the goal states.

We introduce LRT-Diffusion, a risk-aware sampling rule that treats each denoising step as a sequential hypothesis test between the unconditional prior and the state-conditional policy head. Concretely, we accumulate a log-likelihood ratio and gate the conditional mean with a logistic controller whose threshold tau is calibrated once under H0 to meet a user-specified Type-I level alpha. This turns guidance from a fixed push into an evidence-driven adjustment with a user-interpretable risk budget. Importantly, we deliberately leave training vanilla (two heads with standard epsilon-prediction) under the structure of DDPM. LRT guidance composes naturally with Q-gradients: critic-gradient updates can be taken at the unconditional mean, at the LRT-gated mean, or a blend, exposing a continuum from exploitation to conservatism. We standardize states and actions consistently at train and test time and report a state-conditional out-of-distribution (OOD) metric alongside return. On D4RL MuJoCo tasks, LRT-Diffusion improves the return-OOD trade-off over strong Q-guided baselines in our implementation while honoring the desired alpha. Theoretically, we establish level-alpha calibration, concise stability bounds, and a return comparison showing when LRT surpasses Q-guidance-especially when off-support errors dominate. Overall, LRT-Diffusion is a drop-in, inference-time method that adds principled, calibrated risk control to diffusion policies for offline RL.</p></details> |  |

In our work, we propose a practical approach to offline RL with large language models (LLMs). We recast the problem as reward-weighted fine-tuning, which can be solved using similar techniques to supervised fine-tuning (SFT). To showcase the value of our approach, we apply it to learning short-horizon question-answering policies of a fixed length, where the agent reasons about potential answers or asks clarifying questions. Our work stands in a stark contrast to state-of-the-art methods in this domain, based on SFT and direct preference optimization, which have additional hyper-parameters and do not directly optimize for rewards. We compare to them empirically, and report major gains in both optimized rewards and language quality.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at NeurIPS 2025 (main conference)</p></details> |

A key challenge is to identify and utilize source samples that are most relevant to the target domain. Existing approaches address this challenge by measuring domain gaps through domain classifiers, target transition dynamics modeling, or mutual information estimation using contrastive loss. However, these methods often require large target datasets, which is impractical in many real-world scenarios. In this work, we address cross-domain offline RL under a limited target data setting, identifying two primary challenges: (1) Dataset imbalance, which is caused by large source and small target datasets and leads to overfitting in neural network-based domain gap estimators, resulting in uninformative measurements; and (2) Partial domain overlap, where only a subset of the source data is closely aligned with the target domain. To overcome these issues, we propose DmC, a novel framework for cross-domain offline RL with limited target samples. Specifically, DmC utilizes $k$-nearest neighbor ($k$-NN) based estimation to measure domain proximity without neural network training, effectively mitigating overfitting. Then, by utilizing this domain proximity, we introduce a nearest-neighbor-guided diffusion model to generate additional source samples that are better aligned with the target domain, thus enhancing policy learning with more effective source samples. Through theoretical analysis and extensive experiments in diverse MuJoCo environments, we demonstrate that DmC significantly outperforms state-of-the-art cross-domain offline RL methods, achieving substantial performance gains.</p></details> | <details><summary>accep...</summary><p>accepted at ECAI 2025; offline cross-domain reinforcement learning with a guided diffusion model;</p></details> |
| **[Mitigating Distribution Shift in Model-based Offline RL via Shifts-aware Reward Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12830v3)** | 2025-10-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Model-based offline reinforcement learning trains policies using pre-collected datasets and learned environment models, eliminating the need for direct real-world environment interaction. However, this paradigm is inherently challenged by distribution shift~(DS). Existing methods address this issue by leveraging off-policy mechanisms and estimating model uncertainty, but they often result in inconsistent objectives and lack a unified theoretical foundation. This paper offers a comprehensive analysis that disentangles the problem into two fundamental components: model bias and policy shift. Our theoretical and empirical investigations reveal how these factors distort value estimation and restrict policy optimization. To tackle these challenges, we derive a novel shifts-aware reward through a unified probabilistic inference framework, which modifies the vanilla reward to refine value learning and facilitate policy training. Building on this, we develop a practical implementation that leverages classifier-based techniques to approximate the adjusted reward for effective policy optimization. Empirical results across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed approach mitigates distribution shift and achieves superior or comparable performance, validating our theoretical insights.</p></details> |  |
| **[Using Non-Expert Data to Robustify Imitation Learning via Offline Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19495v2)** | 2025-10-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Imitation learning has proven effective for training robots to perform complex tasks from expert human demonstrations. However, it remains limited by its reliance on high-quality, task-specific data, restricting adaptability to the diverse range of real-world object configurations and scenarios. In contrast, non-expert data -- such as play data, suboptimal demonstrations, partial task completions, or rollouts from suboptimal policies -- can offer broader coverage and lower collection costs. However, conventional imitation learning approaches fail to utilize this data effectively. To address these challenges, we posit that with right design decisions, offline reinforcement learning can be used as a tool to harness non-expert data to enhance the performance of imitation learning policies. We show that while standard offline RL approaches can be ineffective at actually leveraging non-expert data under the sparse data coverage settings typically encountered in the real world, simple algorithmic modifications can allow for the utilization of this data, without significant additional assumptions. Our approach shows that broadening the support of the policy distribution can allow imitation algorithms augmented by offline RL to solve tasks robustly, showing considerably enhanced recovery and generalization behavior. In manipulation tasks, these innovations significantly increase the range of initial conditions where learned policies are successful when non-expert data is incorporated. Moreover, we show that these methods are able to leverage all collected data, including partial or suboptimal demonstrations, to bolster task-directed policy performance. This underscores the importance of algorithmic techniques for using non-expert data for robust policy learning in robotics. Website: https://uwrobotlearning.github.io/RISE-offline/</p></details> |  |

We prove the approximate optimality of this approach when integrated with an approximate offline RL oracle and no-regret online optimization. We also present a practical approximation that can be combined with any offline RL algorithm, eliminating the need for offline policy evaluation.

| **[Prior-Guided Diffusion Planning for Offline Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10881v2)** | 2025-10-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models have recently gained prominence in offline reinforcement learning due to their ability to effectively learn high-performing, generalizable policies from static datasets. Diffusion-based planners facilitate long-horizon decision-making by generating high-quality trajectories through iterative denoising, guided by return-maximizing objectives. However, existing guided sampling strategies such as Classifier Guidance, Classifier-Free Guidance, and Monte Carlo Sample Selection either produce suboptimal multi-modal actions, struggle with distributional drift, or incur prohibitive inference-time costs. To address these challenges, we propose Prior Guidance (PG), a novel guided sampling framework that replaces the standard Gaussian prior of a behavior-cloned diffusion model with a learnable distribution, optimized via a behavior-regularized objective. PG directly generates high-value trajectories without costly reward optimization of the diffusion model itself, and eliminates the need to sample multiple candidates at inference for sample selection. We present an efficient training strategy that applies behavior regularization in latent space, and empirically demonstrate that PG outperforms state-of-the-art diffusion policies and planners across diverse long-horizon offline RL benchmarks.Our code is available at https://github.com/ku-dmlab/PG.</p></details> |  |

This enables models to learn complex functions in a generalizable manner. Motivated by this observation, we investigate the benefits of iterative computation for temporal difference (TD) methods in reinforcement learning (RL). Typically they represent value functions in a monolithic fashion, without iterative compute. We introduce floq (flow-matching Q-functions), an approach that parameterizes the Q-function using a velocity field and trains it using techniques from flow-matching, typically used in generative modeling. This velocity field underneath the flow is trained using a TD-learning objective, which bootstraps from values produced by a target velocity field, computed by running multiple steps of numerical integration. Crucially, floq allows for more fine-grained control and scaling of the Q-function capacity than monolithic architectures, by appropriately setting the number of integration steps. Across a suite of challenging offline RL benchmarks and online fine-tuning tasks, floq improves performance by nearly 1.8x. floq scales capacity far better than standard TD-learning architectures, highlighting the potential of iterative computation for value learning.</p></details> | <details><summary>Added...</summary><p>Added new experiments, fixed typos.

| **[Horizon Reduction Makes RL Scalable](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04168v3)** | 2025-10-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this work, we study the scalability of offline reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms. In principle, a truly scalable offline RL algorithm should be able to solve any given problem, regardless of its complexity, given sufficient data, compute, and model capacity. We investigate if and how current offline RL algorithms match up to this promise on diverse, challenging, previously unsolved tasks, using datasets up to 1000x larger than typical offline RL datasets. We observe that despite scaling up data, many existing offline RL algorithms exhibit poor scaling behavior, saturating well below the maximum performance. We hypothesize that the horizon is the main cause behind the poor scaling of offline RL. We empirically verify this hypothesis through several analysis experiments, showing that long horizons indeed present a fundamental barrier to scaling up offline RL. We then show that various horizon reduction techniques substantially enhance scalability on challenging tasks. Based on our insights, we also introduce a minimal yet scalable method named SHARSA that effectively reduces the horizon. SHARSA achieves the best asymptotic performance and scaling behavior among our evaluation methods, showing that explicitly reducing the horizon unlocks the scalability of offline RL.

| **[Pretraining a Shared Q-Network for Data-Efficient Offline Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05701v2)** | 2025-10-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Offline reinforcement learning (RL) aims to learn a policy from a static dataset without further interactions with the environment. Collecting sufficiently large datasets for offline RL is exhausting since this data collection requires colossus interactions with environments and becomes tricky when the interaction with the environment is restricted. Hence, how an agent learns the best policy with a minimal static dataset is a crucial issue in offline RL, similar to the sample efficiency problem in online RL. In this paper, we propose a simple yet effective plug-and-play pretraining method to initialize a feature of a Q-network to enhance data efficiency in offline RL. Specifically, we introduce a shared Q-network structure that outputs predictions of the next state and Q-value. We pretrain the shared Q-network through a supervised regression task that predicts a next state and trains the shared Q-network using diverse offline RL methods. Through extensive experiments, we empirically demonstrate that our method enhances the performance of existing popular offline RL methods on the D4RL, Robomimic and V-D4RL benchmarks. Furthermore, we show that our method significantly boosts data-efficient offline RL across various data qualities and data distributions trough D4RL and ExoRL benchmarks. Notably, our method adapted with only 10% of the dataset outperforms standard algorithms even with full datasets.</p></details> |  |
| **[Finite-Time Bounds for Average-Reward Fitted Q-Iteration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17391v1)** | 2025-10-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Although there is an extensive body of work characterizing the sample complexity of discounted-return offline RL with function approximations, prior work on the average-reward setting has received significantly less attention, and existing approaches rely on restrictive assumptions, such as ergodicity or linearity of the MDP. In this work, we establish the first sample complexity results for average-reward offline RL with function approximation for weakly communicating MDPs, a much milder assumption. To this end, we introduce Anchored Fitted Q-Iteration, which combines the standard Fitted Q-Iteration with an anchor mechanism. We show that the anchor, which can be interpreted as a form of weight decay, is crucial for enabling finite-time analysis in the average-reward setting. We also extend our finite-time analysis to the setup where the dataset is generated from a single-trajectory rather than IID transitions, again leveraging the anchor mechanism.</p></details> |  |
| **[Transfer Q-learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.04709v2)** | 2025-10-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time-inhomogeneous finite-horizon Markov decision processes (MDP) are frequently employed to model decision-making in dynamic treatment regimes and other statistical reinforcement learning (RL) scenarios. These fields, especially healthcare and business, often face challenges such as high-dimensional state spaces and time-inhomogeneity of the MDP process, compounded by insufficient sample availability which complicates informed decision-making. To overcome these challenges, we investigate knowledge transfer within time-inhomogeneous finite-horizon MDP by leveraging data from both a target RL task and several related source tasks. We have developed transfer learning (TL) algorithms that are adaptable for both batch and online $Q$-learning, integrating valuable insights from offline source studies. The proposed transfer $Q$-learning algorithm contains a novel {\em re-targeting} step that enables {\em cross-stage transfer} along multiple stages in an RL task, besides the usual {\em cross-task transfer} for supervised learning. We establish the first theoretical justifications of TL in RL tasks by showing a faster rate of convergence of the $Q^*$-function estimation in the offline RL transfer, and a lower regret bound in the offline-to-online RL transfer under stage-wise reward similarity and mild design similarity across tasks. Empirical evidence from both synthetic and real datasets is presented to evaluate the proposed algorithm and support our theoretical results.</p></details> |  |
| **[MOBODY: Model Based Off-Dynamics Offline Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08460v2)** | 2025-10-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We study off-dynamics offline reinforcement learning, where the goal is to learn a policy from offline source and limited target datasets with mismatched dynamics. Existing methods either penalize the reward or discard source transitions occurring in parts of the transition space with high dynamics shift. As a result, they optimize the policy using data from low-shift regions, limiting exploration of high-reward states in the target domain that do not fall within these regions. Consequently, such methods often fail when the dynamics shift is significant or the optimal trajectories lie outside the low-shift regions. To overcome this limitation, we propose MOBODY, a Model-Based Off-Dynamics Offline RL algorithm that optimizes a policy using learned target dynamics transitions to explore the target domain, rather than only being trained with the low dynamics-shift transitions. For the dynamics learning, built on the observation that achieving the same next state requires taking different actions in different domains, MOBODY employs separate action encoders for each domain to encode different actions to the shared latent space while sharing a unified representation of states and a common transition function. We further introduce a target Q-weighted behavior cloning loss in policy optimization to avoid out-of-distribution actions, which push the policy toward actions with high target-domain Q-values, rather than high source domain Q-values or uniformly imitating all actions in the offline dataset. We evaluate MOBODY on a wide range of MuJoCo and Adroit benchmarks, demonstrating that it outperforms state-of-the-art off-dynamics RL baselines as well as policy learning methods based on different dynamics learning baselines, with especially pronounced improvements in challenging scenarios where existing methods struggle.</p></details> |  |

Existing approaches often rely on pre-collected expert demonstrations and train policies via imitation learning (IL) or offline reinforcement learning (RL). However, obtaining high-quality demonstrations for precision tasks is difficult and time-consuming, while offline RL commonly suffers from distribution shifts and low data efficiency. We introduce a Role-Model Reinforcement Learning (RM-RL) framework that unifies online and offline training in real-world environments. The key idea is a role-model strategy that automatically generates labels for online training data using approximately optimal actions, eliminating the need for human demonstrations. RM-RL reformulates policy learning as supervised training, reducing instability from distribution mismatch and improving efficiency. A hybrid training scheme further leverages online role-model data for offline reuse, enhancing data efficiency through repeated sampling. Extensive experiments show that RM-RL converges faster and more stably than existing RL methods, yielding significant gains in real-world manipulation: 53% improvement in translation accuracy and 20% in rotation accuracy. Finally, we demonstrate the successful execution of a challenging task, precisely placing a cell plate onto a shelf, highlighting the framework's effectiveness where prior methods fail.</p></details> |  |

Through mathematical analysis, we reveal that standard SFT gradients implicitly encode a problematic reward structure that may severely restrict the generalization capabilities of model. To rectify this, we propose Dynamic Fine-Tuning (DFT), stabilizing gradient updates for each token by dynamically rescaling the objective function with the probability of this token. Remarkably, this single-line code change significantly outperforms standard SFT across multiple challenging benchmarks and base models, demonstrating greatly improved generalization. Additionally, our approach shows competitive results in offline RL settings, offering an effective yet simpler alternative. This work bridges theoretical insight and practical solutions, substantially advancing SFT performance.

In most cases, we are only given imperfect simulators with simplified dynamics, which inevitably lead to severe sim-to-real gaps in RL policy learning. The recently emerged field of offline RL provides another possibility to learn policies directly from pre-collected historical data. However, to achieve reasonable performance, existing offline RL algorithms need impractically large offline data with sufficient state-action space coverage for training. This brings up a new question: is it possible to combine learning from limited real data in offline RL and unrestricted exploration through imperfect simulators in online RL to address the drawbacks of both approaches? In this study, we propose the Dynamics-Aware Hybrid Offline-and-Online Reinforcement Learning (H2O) framework to provide an affirmative answer to this question. H2O introduces a dynamics-aware policy evaluation scheme, which adaptively penalizes the Q function learning on simulated state-action pairs with large dynamics gaps, while also simultaneously allowing learning from a fixed real-world dataset. Through extensive simulation and real-world tasks, as well as theoretical analysis, we demonstrate the superior performance of H2O against other cross-domain online and offline RL algorithms. H2O provides a brand new hybrid offline-and-online RL paradigm, which can potentially shed light on future RL algorithm design for solving practical real-world tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>NeurI...</summary><p>NeurIPS 2022 Spotlight</p></details> |
| **[Expert or not? assessing data quality in offline reinforcement learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12638v1)** | 2025-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Offline reinforcement learning (RL) learns exclusively from static datasets, without further interaction with the environment. In practice, such datasets vary widely in quality, often mixing expert, suboptimal, and even random trajectories. The choice of algorithm therefore depends on dataset fidelity. Behavior cloning can suffice on high-quality data, whereas mixed- or low-quality data typically benefits from offline RL methods that stitch useful behavior across trajectories. Yet in the wild it is difficult to assess dataset quality a priori because the data's provenance and skill composition are unknown. We address the problem of estimating offline dataset quality without training an agent. We study a spectrum of proxies from simple cumulative rewards to learned value based estimators, and introduce the Bellman Wasserstein distance (BWD), a value aware optimal transport score that measures how dissimilar a dataset's behavioral policy is from a random reference policy. BWD is computed from a behavioral critic and a state conditional OT formulation, requiring no environment interaction or full policy optimization. Across D4RL MuJoCo tasks, BWD strongly correlates with an oracle performance score that aggregates multiple offline RL algorithms, enabling efficient prediction of how well standard agents will perform on a given dataset. Beyond prediction, integrating BWD as a regularizer during policy optimization explicitly pushes the learned policy away from random behavior and improves returns. These results indicate that value aware, distributional signals such as BWD are practical tools for triaging offline RL datasets and policy optimization.</p></details> |  |

Despite its success in the single-agent setting, offline multi-agent RL remains a challenge, especially in competitive games. Firstly, unaware of the game structure, it is impossible to interact with the opponents and conduct a major learning paradigm, self-play, for competitive games. Secondly, real-world datasets cannot cover all the state and action space in the game, resulting in barriers to identifying Nash equilibrium (NE). To address these issues, this paper introduces OFF-FSP, the first practical model-free offline RL algorithm for competitive games. We start by simulating interactions with various opponents by adjusting the weights of the fixed dataset with importance sampling. This technique allows us to learn the best responses to different opponents and employ the Offline Self-Play learning framework. To overcome the challenge of partial coverage, we combine the single-agent offline RL method with Fictitious Self-Play (FSP) to approximate NE by constraining the approximate best responses away from out-of-distribution actions. Experiments on matrix games, extensive-form poker, and board games demonstrate that OFF-FSP achieves significantly lower exploitability than state-of-the-art baselines. Finally, we validate OFF-FSP on a real-world human-robot competitive task, demonstrating its potential for solving complex, hard-to-simulate real-world problems.</p></details> |  |

This analysis links transition and reward prediction losses to representation quality, yielding online, "deep" analogues of classical SPI theorems from the offline RL literature. Building on these results, we introduce DeepSPI, a principled on-policy algorithm that couples local transition and reward losses with regularised policy updates.

Bandwidth estimation for real-time communications remains an open challenge due to rapidly evolving network architectures, increasingly complex protocol stacks, and the difficulty of defining QoE metrics that reliably improve user experience. In this work, we propose a deployed, human-in-the-loop, data-driven framework for bandwidth estimation to address these challenges. Our approach begins with training objective QoE reward models derived from subjective user evaluations to measure audio and video quality in real-time video conferencing systems. Subsequently, we collect roughly $1$M network traces with objective QoE rewards from real-world Microsoft Teams calls to curate a bandwidth estimation training dataset. We then introduce a novel distributional offline reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm to train a neural-network-based bandwidth estimator aimed at improving QoE for users. Our real-world A/B test demonstrates that the proposed approach reduces the subjective poor call ratio by $11.41\%$ compared to the baseline bandwidth estimator. Furthermore, the proposed offline RL algorithm is benchmarked on D4RL tasks to demonstrate its generalization beyond bandwidth estimation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication in the proceedings of the AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence 2026 (IAAI Technical Track on Deployed Highly Innovative Applications of AI)</p></details> |

However, existing methods face a stark trade-off: slow, iterative models like diffusion policies are computationally expensive, while fast, single-step models like consistency policies often suffer from degraded performance. In this paper, we demonstrate that it is possible to bridge this gap. The key to moving beyond the limitations of individual methods, we argue, lies in a unifying perspective that views modern generative models, including diffusion, flow matching, and consistency models, as specific instances of learning a continuous-time generative trajectory governed by an Ordinary Differential Equation (ODE). This principled foundation provides a clearer design space for generative policies in RL and allows us to propose Generative Trajectory Policies (GTPs), a new and more general policy paradigm that learns the entire solution map of the underlying ODE. To make this paradigm practical for offline RL, we further introduce two key theoretically principled adaptations. Empirical results demonstrate that GTP achieves state-of-the-art performance on D4RL benchmarks - it significantly outperforms prior generative policies, achieving perfect scores on several notoriously hard AntMaze tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint.

We introduce mathematical tools for fairly analyzing policies under partial observability and revealing how agents use memory to make decisions. To utilize these tools, we present POPGym Arcade, a collection of Atari-inspired, hardware-accelerated, pixel-based environments sharing a single observation and action space. Each environment provides fully and partially observable variants, enabling counterfactual studies on observability. We find that controlled studies are necessary for fair comparisons, and identify a pathology where value functions smear credit over irrelevant history. With this pathology, we demonstrate how out-of-distribution scenarios can contaminate memory, perturbing the policy far into the future, with implications for sim-to-real transfer and offline RL.</p></details> |  |

However, existing works mainly focus on pixel-level triggers that are impractical to deploy in the real world. We address this gap by introducing a novel backdoor attack against the end-to-end AD systems that leverage one or more other vehicles' trajectories as triggers. To generate precise trigger trajectories, we first use temporal logic (TL) specifications to define the behaviors of attacker vehicles. Configurable behavior models are then used to generate these trajectories, which are quantitatively evaluated and iteratively refined based on the TL specifications. We further develop a negative training strategy by incorporating patch trajectories that are similar to triggers but are designated not to activate the backdoor. It enhances the stealthiness of the attack and refines the system's responses to trigger scenarios. Through extensive experiments on 5 offline reinforcement learning (RL) driving agents with 6 trigger patterns and target action combinations, we demonstrate the flexibility and effectiveness of our proposed attack, showing the under-exploration of existing end-to-end AD systems' vulnerabilities to such trajectory-based backdoor attacks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Expressive Value Learning for Scalable Offline Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08218v1)** | 2025-10-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement learning (RL) is a powerful paradigm for learning to make sequences of decisions. However, RL has yet to be fully leveraged in robotics, principally due to its lack of scalability. Offline RL offers a promising avenue by training agents on large, diverse datasets, avoiding the costly real-world interactions of online RL. Scaling offline RL to increasingly complex datasets requires expressive generative models such as diffusion and flow matching. However, existing methods typically depend on either backpropagation through time (BPTT), which is computationally prohibitive, or policy distillation, which introduces compounding errors and limits scalability to larger base policies. In this paper, we consider the question of how to develop a scalable offline RL approach without relying on distillation or backpropagation through time. We introduce Expressive Value Learning for Offline Reinforcement Learning (EVOR): a scalable offline RL approach that integrates both expressive policies and expressive value functions. EVOR learns an optimal, regularized Q-function via flow matching during training. At inference-time, EVOR performs inference-time policy extraction via rejection sampling against the expressive value function, enabling efficient optimization, regularization, and compute-scalable search without retraining. Empirically, we show that EVOR outperforms baselines on a diverse set of offline RL tasks, demonstrating the benefit of integrating expressive value learning into offline RL.</p></details> | 24 pages, 5 figures |
| **[Energy-Guided Diffusion Sampling for Long-Term User Behavior Prediction in Reinforcement Learning-based Recommendation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12815v1)** | 2025-10-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement learning-based recommender systems (RL4RS) have gained attention for their ability to adapt to dynamic user preferences. However, these systems face challenges, particularly in offline settings, where data inefficiency and reliance on pre-collected trajectories limit their broader applicability. While offline reinforcement learning methods leverage extensive datasets to address these issues, they often struggle with noisy data and fail to capture long-term user preferences, resulting in suboptimal recommendation policies. To overcome these limitations, we propose Diffusion-enhanced Actor-Critic for Offline RL4RS (DAC4Rec), a novel framework that integrates diffusion processes with reinforcement learning to model complex user preferences more effectively. DAC4Rec leverages the denoising capabilities of diffusion models to enhance the robustness of offline RL algorithms and incorporates a Q-value-guided policy optimization strategy to better handle suboptimal trajectories. Additionally, we introduce an energy-based sampling strategy to reduce randomness during recommendation generation, ensuring more targeted and reliable outcomes. We validate the effectiveness of DAC4Rec through extensive experiments on six real-world offline datasets and in an online simulation environment, demonstrating its ability to optimize long-term user preferences. Furthermore, we show that the proposed diffusion policy can be seamlessly integrated into other commonly used RL algorithms in RL4RS, highlighting its versatility and wide applicability.</p></details> | CIKM'25 |

However, current approaches still struggle with complex, long-horizon sequential decision making. In this work, we introduce DEtached value learning with Action Sequence (DEAS), a simple yet effective offline RL framework that leverages action sequences for value learning. These temporally extended actions provide richer information than single-step actions and can be interpreted through the options framework via semi-Markov decision process Q-learning, enabling reduction of the effective planning horizon by considering longer sequences at once. However, directly adopting such sequences in actor-critic algorithms introduces excessive value overestimation, which we address through detached value learning that steers value estimates toward in-distribution actions that achieve high return in the offline dataset. We demonstrate that DEAS consistently outperforms baselines on complex, long-horizon tasks from OGBench and can be applied to enhance the performance of large-scale Vision-Language-Action models that predict action sequences, significantly boosting performance in both RoboCasa Kitchen simulation tasks and real-world manipulation tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project website: https://changyeon.site/deas</p></details> |
| **[PyCFRL: A Python library for counterfactually fair offline reinforcement learning via sequential data preprocessing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06935v1)** | 2025-10-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement learning (RL) aims to learn and evaluate a sequential decision rule, often referred to as a "policy", that maximizes the population-level benefit in an environment across possibly infinitely many time steps. However, the sequential decisions made by an RL algorithm, while optimized to maximize overall population benefits, may disadvantage certain individuals who are in minority or socioeconomically disadvantaged groups. To address this problem, we introduce PyCFRL, a Python library for ensuring counterfactual fairness in offline RL. PyCFRL implements a novel data preprocessing algorithm for learning counterfactually fair RL policies from offline datasets and provides tools to evaluate the values and counterfactual unfairness levels of RL policies. We describe the high-level functionalities of PyCFRL and demonstrate one of its major use cases through a data example. The library is publicly available on PyPI and Github (https://github.com/JianhanZhang/PyCFRL), and detailed tutorials can be found in the PyCFRL documentation (https://pycfrl-documentation.netlify.app).</p></details> |  |
| **[Adjusting the Output of Decision Transformer with Action Gradient](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05285v1)** | 2025-10-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Decision Transformer (DT), which integrates reinforcement learning (RL) with the transformer model, introduces a novel approach to offline RL. Unlike classical algorithms that take maximizing cumulative discounted rewards as objective, DT instead maximizes the likelihood of actions. This paradigm shift, however, presents two key challenges: stitching trajectories and extrapolation of action. Existing methods, such as substituting specific tokens with predictive values and integrating the Policy Gradient (PG) method, address these challenges individually but fail to improve performance stably when combined due to inherent instability. To address this, we propose Action Gradient (AG), an innovative methodology that directly adjusts actions to fulfill a function analogous to that of PG, while also facilitating efficient integration with token prediction techniques. AG utilizes the gradient of the Q-value with respect to the action to optimize the action. The empirical results demonstrate that our method can significantly enhance the performance of DT-based algorithms, with some results achieving state-of-the-art levels.</p></details> |  |
| **[VIPO: Value Function Inconsistency Penalized Offline Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11944v2)** | 2025-10-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Offline reinforcement learning (RL) learns effective policies from pre-collected datasets, offering a practical solution for applications where online interactions are risky or costly. Model-based approaches are particularly advantageous for offline RL, owing to their data efficiency and generalizability. However, due to inherent model errors, model-based methods often artificially introduce conservatism guided by heuristic uncertainty estimation, which can be unreliable. In this paper, we introduce VIPO, a novel model-based offline RL algorithm that incorporates self-supervised feedback from value estimation to enhance model training. Specifically, the model is learned by additionally minimizing the inconsistency between the value learned directly from the offline data and the one estimated from the model. We perform comprehensive evaluations from multiple perspectives to show that VIPO can learn a highly accurate model efficiently and consistently outperform existing methods. In particular, it achieves state-of-the-art performance on almost all tasks in both D4RL and NeoRL benchmarks. Overall, VIPO offers a general framework that can be readily integrated into existing model-based offline RL algorithms to systematically enhance model accuracy.</p></details> |  |
| **[HOFLON: Hybrid Offline Learning and Online Optimization for Process Start-Up and Grade-Transition Control](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03830v1)** | 2025-10-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Start-ups and product grade-changes are critical steps in continuous-process plant operation, because any misstep immediately affects product quality and drives operational losses. These transitions have long relied on manual operation by a handful of expert operators, but the progressive retirement of that workforce is leaving plant owners without the tacit know-how needed to execute them consistently. In the absence of a process model, offline reinforcement learning (RL) promises to capture and even surpass human expertise by mining historical start-up and grade-change logs, yet standard offline RL struggles with distribution shift and value-overestimation whenever a learned policy ventures outside the data envelope. We introduce HOFLON (Hybrid Offline Learning + Online Optimization) to overcome those limitations. Offline, HOFLON learns (i) a latent data manifold that represents the feasible region spanned by past transitions and (ii) a long-horizon Q-critic that predicts the cumulative reward from state-action pairs. Online, it solves a one-step optimization problem that maximizes the Q-critic while penalizing deviations from the learned manifold and excessive rates of change in the manipulated variables. We test HOFLON on two industrial case studies: a polymerization reactor start-up and a paper-machine grade-change problem, and benchmark it against Implicit Q-Learning (IQL), a leading offline-RL algorithm. In both plants HOFLON not only surpasses IQL but also delivers, on average, better cumulative rewards than the best start-up or grade-change observed in the historical data, demonstrating its potential to automate transition operations beyond current expert capability.</p></details> | <details><summary>31 pa...</summary><p>31 pages, 15 figures, submitted to Computers and Chemical Engineering</p></details> |

Prior work established that statistically efficient learning is impossible for either of these problems when the only assumptions are that the data has good coverage (concentrability) and the state-action value function of every policy is linearly realizable ($q^π$-realizability) (Foster et al., 2021). Recently, Tkachuk et al. (2024) gave a statistically efficient learner for policy optimization, if in addition the data is assumed to be given as trajectories. In this work we present a statistically efficient learner for policy evaluation under the same assumptions. Further, we show that the sample complexity of the learner used by Tkachuk et al. (2024) for policy optimization can be improved by a tighter analysis.</p></details> |  |
| **[Use the Online Network If You Can: Towards Fast and Stable Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02590v1)** | 2025-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The use of target networks is a popular approach for estimating value functions in deep Reinforcement Learning (RL). While effective, the target network remains a compromise solution that preserves stability at the cost of slowly moving targets, thus delaying learning. Conversely, using the online network as a bootstrapped target is intuitively appealing, albeit well-known to lead to unstable learning. In this work, we aim to obtain the best out of both worlds by introducing a novel update rule that computes the target using the MINimum estimate between the Target and Online network, giving rise to our method, MINTO. Through this simple, yet effective modification, we show that MINTO enables faster and stable value function learning, by mitigating the potential overestimation bias of using the online network for bootstrapping. Notably, MINTO can be seamlessly integrated into a wide range of value-based and actor-critic algorithms with a negligible cost. We evaluate MINTO extensively across diverse benchmarks, spanning online and offline RL, as well as discrete and continuous action spaces. Across all benchmarks, MINTO consistently improves performance, demonstrating its broad applicability and effectiveness.</p></details> |  |
| **[Enhanced DACER Algorithm with High Diffusion Efficiency](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23426v2)** | 2025-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Due to their expressive capacity, diffusion models have shown great promise in offline RL and imitation learning. Diffusion Actor-Critic with Entropy Regulator (DACER) extended this capability to online RL by using the reverse diffusion process as a policy approximator, achieving state-of-the-art performance. However, it still suffers from a core trade-off: more diffusion steps ensure high performance but reduce efficiency, while fewer steps degrade performance. This remains a major bottleneck for deploying diffusion policies in real-time online RL. To mitigate this, we propose DACERv2, which leverages a Q-gradient field objective with respect to action as an auxiliary optimization target to guide the denoising process at each diffusion step, thereby introducing intermediate supervisory signals that enhance the efficiency of single-step diffusion. Additionally, we observe that the independence of the Q-gradient field from the diffusion time step is inconsistent with the characteristics of the diffusion process. To address this issue, a temporal weighting mechanism is introduced, allowing the model to effectively eliminate large-scale noise during the early stages and refine its outputs in the later stages. Experimental results on OpenAI Gym benchmarks and multimodal tasks demonstrate that, compared with classical and diffusion-based online RL algorithms, DACERv2 achieves higher performance in most complex control environments with only five diffusion steps and shows greater multimodality.</p></details> |  |
| **[Density-Ratio Weighted Behavioral Cloning: Learning Control Policies from Corrupted Datasets](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01479v1)** | 2025-10-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Offline reinforcement learning (RL) enables policy optimization from fixed datasets, making it suitable for safety-critical applications where online exploration is infeasible. However, these datasets are often contaminated by adversarial poisoning, system errors, or low-quality samples, leading to degraded policy performance in standard behavioral cloning (BC) and offline RL methods. This paper introduces Density-Ratio Weighted Behavioral Cloning (Weighted BC), a robust imitation learning approach that uses a small, verified clean reference set to estimate trajectory-level density ratios via a binary discriminator. These ratios are clipped and used as weights in the BC objective to prioritize clean expert behavior while down-weighting or discarding corrupted data, without requiring knowledge of the contamination mechanism. We establish theoretical guarantees showing convergence to the clean expert policy with finite-sample bounds that are independent of the contamination rate. A comprehensive evaluation framework is established, which incorporates various poisoning protocols (reward, state, transition, and action) on continuous control benchmarks. Experiments demonstrate that Weighted BC maintains near-optimal performance even at high contamination ratios outperforming baselines such as traditional BC, batch-constrained Q-learning (BCQ) and behavior regularized actor-critic (BRAC).</p></details> |  |
| **[DiSA-IQL: Offline Reinforcement Learning for Robust Soft Robot Control under Distribution Shifts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00358v1)** | 2025-09-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Soft snake robots offer remarkable flexibility and adaptability in complex environments, yet their control remains challenging due to highly nonlinear dynamics. Existing model-based and bio-inspired controllers rely on simplified assumptions that limit performance. Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has recently emerged as a promising alternative, but online training is often impractical because of costly and potentially damaging real-world interactions. Offline RL provides a safer option by leveraging pre-collected datasets, but it suffers from distribution shift, which degrades generalization to unseen scenarios. To overcome this challenge, we propose DiSA-IQL (Distribution-Shift-Aware Implicit Q-Learning), an extension of IQL that incorporates robustness modulation by penalizing unreliable state-action pairs to mitigate distribution shift. We evaluate DiSA-IQL on goal-reaching tasks across two settings: in-distribution and out-of-distribution evaluation. Simulation results show that DiSA-IQL consistently outperforms baseline models, including Behavior Cloning (BC), Conservative Q-Learning (CQL), and vanilla IQL, achieving higher success rates, smoother trajectories, and improved robustness. The codes are open-sourced to support reproducibility and to facilitate further research in offline RL for soft robot control.</p></details> |  |
| **[In-Context Compositional Q-Learning for Offline Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24067v1)** | 2025-09-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurately estimating the Q-function is a central challenge in offline reinforcement learning. However, existing approaches often rely on a single global Q-function, which struggles to capture the compositional nature of tasks involving diverse subtasks. We propose In-context Compositional Q-Learning (\texttt{ICQL}), the first offline RL framework that formulates Q-learning as a contextual inference problem, using linear Transformers to adaptively infer local Q-functions from retrieved transitions without explicit subtask labels. Theoretically, we show that under two assumptions--linear approximability of the local Q-function and accurate weight inference from retrieved context--\texttt{ICQL} achieves bounded Q-function approximation error, and supports near-optimal policy extraction. Empirically, \texttt{ICQL} substantially improves performance in offline settings: improving performance in kitchen tasks by up to 16.4\%, and in Gym and Adroit tasks by up to 8.6\% and 6.3\%. These results highlight the underexplored potential of in-context learning for robust and compositional value estimation, positioning \texttt{ICQL} as a principled and effective framework for offline RL.</p></details> |  |
| **[Double Check My Desired Return: Transformer with Target Alignment for Offline Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16420v2)** | 2025-09-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Offline reinforcement learning (RL) has achieved significant advances in domains such as robotic control, autonomous driving, and medical decision-making. Most existing methods primarily focus on training policies that maximize cumulative returns from a given dataset. However, many real-world applications require precise control over policy performance levels, rather than simply pursuing the best possible return. Reinforcement learning via supervised learning (RvS) frames offline RL as a sequence modeling task, enabling the extraction of diverse policies by conditioning on different desired returns. Yet, existing RvS-based transformers, such as Decision Transformer (DT), struggle to reliably align the actual achieved returns with specified target returns, especially when interpolating within underrepresented returns or extrapolating beyond the dataset. To address this limitation, we propose Doctor, a novel approach that Double Checks the Transformer with target alignment for Offline RL. Doctor integrates the strengths of supervised learning (SL) and temporal difference (TD) learning by jointly optimizing the action prediction and value estimation. During inference, Doctor introduces a double-check mechanism: actions are first sampled around the desired target returns and then validated with value functions. This ensures more accurate alignment between predicted actions and desired target returns. We evaluate Doctor on the D4RL and EpiCare benchmarks, demonstrating aligned control yields stronger performance and tunable expertise, showing its effectiveness in a wide range of tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Multi-Agent Path Finding via Offline RL and LLM Collaboration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22130v1)** | 2025-09-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-Agent Path Finding (MAPF) poses a significant and challenging problem critical for applications in robotics and logistics, particularly due to its combinatorial complexity and the partial observability inherent in realistic environments. Decentralized reinforcement learning methods commonly encounter two substantial difficulties: first, they often yield self-centered behaviors among agents, resulting in frequent collisions, and second, their reliance on complex communication modules leads to prolonged training times, sometimes spanning weeks. To address these challenges, we propose an efficient decentralized planning framework based on the Decision Transformer (DT), uniquely leveraging offline reinforcement learning to substantially reduce training durations from weeks to mere hours. Crucially, our approach effectively handles long-horizon credit assignment and significantly improves performance in scenarios with sparse and delayed rewards. Furthermore, to overcome adaptability limitations inherent in standard RL methods under dynamic environmental changes, we integrate a large language model (GPT-4o) to dynamically guide agent policies. Extensive experiments in both static and dynamically changing environments demonstrate that our DT-based approach, augmented briefly by GPT-4o, significantly enhances adaptability and performance.</p></details> |  |
| **[Structural Information-based Hierarchical Diffusion for Offline Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21942v1)** | 2025-09-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion-based generative methods have shown promising potential for modeling trajectories from offline reinforcement learning (RL) datasets, and hierarchical diffusion has been introduced to mitigate variance accumulation and computational challenges in long-horizon planning tasks. However, existing approaches typically assume a fixed two-layer diffusion hierarchy with a single predefined temporal scale, which limits adaptability to diverse downstream tasks and reduces flexibility in decision making. In this work, we propose SIHD, a novel Structural Information-based Hierarchical Diffusion framework for effective and stable offline policy learning in long-horizon environments with sparse rewards. Specifically, we analyze structural information embedded in offline trajectories to construct the diffusion hierarchy adaptively, enabling flexible trajectory modeling across multiple temporal scales. Rather than relying on reward predictions from localized sub-trajectories, we quantify the structural information gain of each state community and use it as a conditioning signal within the corresponding diffusion layer. To reduce overreliance on offline datasets, we introduce a structural entropy regularizer that encourages exploration of underrepresented states while avoiding extrapolation errors from distributional shifts. Extensive evaluations on challenging offline RL tasks show that SIHD significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in decision-making performance and demonstrates superior generalization across diverse scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by NeurIPS 2025</p></details> |

This study introduces GNN-DT, a novel Decision Transformer (DT) architecture that integrates Graph Neural Network (GNN) embedders with a novel residual connection between input and output tokens crucial for handling dynamic environments. By learning from previously collected trajectories, GNN-DT tackles the sparse rewards limitations of online RL algorithms and delivers high-quality solutions in real-time. We evaluate GNN-DT on the complex electric vehicle (EV) charging optimization problem and prove that its performance is superior and requires significantly fewer training trajectories, thus improving sample efficiency compared to existing DT and offline RL baselines. Furthermore, GNN-DT exhibits robust generalization to unseen environments and larger action spaces, addressing a critical gap in prior offline and online RL approaches.</p></details> |  |

In many of these problems, the reward function is verifiable, a setting termed RL with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR). We apply RLVR to a popular data science benchmark called BIRD that measures the ability of an AI agent to convert a natural language query for a database to SQL executions. We apply a simple and general-purpose training recipe involving careful prompt and model selection, a warm-up stage using our offline RL approach called TAO, followed by rigorous online RLVR training. With no additional training data beyond the BIRD training set and no use of proprietary models, our very first submission to the BIRD leaderboard reached state-of-the-art accuracy on the private test set: 73.56% without self-consistency and 75.68% with self-consistency. In the latter case, our model also required fewer generations than the second-best approach. While BIRD is only a proxy task, the simplicity of our framework makes it broadly applicable to enterprise domains such as business intelligence, data science, and coding.</p></details> |  |

However, current approaches face a fundamental dilemma: offline RL enables stable training on pre-collected trajectories, but struggles with multi-step task execution for lack of trajectory-level reward signals; online RL captures these signals through environment interaction, but suffers from sparse rewards and prohibitive deployment costs. To address it, we present Semi-online Reinforcement Learning, a novel paradigm that simulates online RL on offline trajectories. During each rollout process, we preserve the original model output within the multi-turn dialogue, where a Patch Module adaptively recovers the divergence between rollout and expert trajectories. To capture long-term training signals, Semi-online RL introduces discounted future returns into the reward computation and optimizes the policy with weighted step-level and episode-level advantages. We further introduce Semi-Online Performance (SOP), a metric that aligns better with true online performance, serving as a practical and effective proxy for real-world evaluation. Experiments show that ours Semi-online RL achieves SOTA performance among 7B models across four dynamic benchmarks, with significant gains over the base model (e.g., +12.0% on AndroidWorld, +23.8% on AITW), demonstrating significant progress in bridging the gap between offline training efficiency and online multi-turn reasoning.

Recently, to optimize long-term user satisfaction, Reinforcement Learning (RL) is used for MTF in RSs. However, the existing offline RL algorithms used for MTF have the following severe problems: a) To avoid Out-of-Distribution (OOD), their constraints are overly strict, which seriously damage performance; b) They are unaware of the exploration policy used to collect training data, only suboptimal policy can be learned; c) Their exploration policies are inefficient and hurt user experience. To solve the above problems, we propose an innovative method called UnifiedRL tailored for MTF in large-scale RSs. UnifiedRL seamlessly integrates offline RL model with its custom exploration policy to relax overly strict constraints, which is different from existing RL-MTF methods and significantly improves performance. In addition, compared to existing exploration policies, UnifiedRL's custom exploration policy is highly efficient, enabling frequent online exploration and offline training iterations, which further improves performance. Extensive offline and online experiments are conducted in a large-scale RS. The results demonstrate that UnifiedRL outperforms other existing MTF methods remarkably, achieving a +4.64% increase in user valid consumption and a +1.74% increase in user duration time. To the best of our knowledge, UnifiedRL is the first RL algorithm tailored for MTF in RSs and has been successfully deployed in multiple large-scale RSs since June 2023, yielding significant benefits.</p></details> |  |

However, trajectory-wise preference labels are difficult to meet the precise learning of step-wise reward, thereby affecting the performance of downstream algorithms. To alleviate the insufficient step-wise reward caused by trajectory-wise preferences, we propose a novel preference-based reward acquisition method: Diffusion Preference-based Reward (DPR). DPR directly treats step-wise preference-based reward acquisition as a binary classification and utilizes the robustness of diffusion classifiers to infer step-wise rewards discriminatively. In addition, to further utilize trajectory-wise preference information, we propose Conditional Diffusion Preference-based Reward (C-DPR), which conditions on trajectory-wise preference labels to enhance reward inference. We apply the above methods to existing offline RL algorithms, and a series of experimental results demonstrate that the diffusion classifier-driven reward outperforms the previous reward acquisition method with the Bradley-Terry model.</p></details> |  |

Dynamic programming methods are the most widely used and form the foundation of both classical and modern reinforcement learning (RL). By contrast, LP-based methods have been less commonly employed, although they have recently gained attention in contexts such as offline RL. The relative underuse of the LP-based methods stems from the fact that it leads to an inequality-constrained optimization problem, which is generally more challenging to solve effectively compared with Bellman-equation-based methods. The purpose of this paper is to establish a theoretical foundation for solving LP-based MDPs in a more effective and practical manner. Our key idea is to leverage the log-barrier function, widely used in inequality-constrained optimization, to transform the LP formulation of the MDP into an unconstrained optimization problem. This reformulation enables approximate solutions to be obtained easily via gradient descent. While the method may appear simple, to the best of our knowledge, a thorough theoretical interpretation of this approach has not yet been developed. This paper aims to bridge this gap.</p></details> |  |

However, many existing methods do not directly generate actions alongside states and rewards, limiting their compatibility with standard value-based offline RL algorithms that rely on one-step temporal difference (TD) learning. While prior work has explored joint modeling of states, rewards, and actions to address this issue, such formulations often lead to increased training complexity and reduced performance in practice. We propose \textbf{DAWM}, a diffusion-based world model that generates future state-reward trajectories conditioned on the current state, action, and return-to-go, paired with an inverse dynamics model (IDM) for efficient action inference. This modular design produces complete synthetic transitions suitable for one-step TD-based offline RL, enabling effective and computationally efficient training. Empirically, we show that conservative offline RL algorithms such as TD3BC and IQL benefit significantly from training on these augmented trajectories, consistently outperforming prior diffusion-based baselines across multiple tasks in the D4RL benchmark.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICML2...</summary><p>ICML2025 workshop Building Physically Plausible World Models</p></details> |

However, implementation poses significant challenges. Defining direct rewards is difficult, and inverse RL (IRL) struggles to infer accurate reward functions from expert behavior in complex environments. Offline RL also encounters challenges in aligning learned policies with observed human behavior in healthcare applications. To address challenges in applying offline RL to physical activity promotion for older adults at high risk of falls, based on wearable sensor activity monitoring, we introduce Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks and Diffusion Policies for Offline Inverse Reinforcement Learning (KANDI). By leveraging the flexible function approximation in Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks, we estimate reward functions by learning free-living environment behavior from low-fall-risk older adults (experts), while diffusion-based policies within an Actor-Critic framework provide a generative approach for action refinement and efficiency in offline RL. We evaluate KANDI using wearable activity monitoring data in a two-arm clinical trial from our Physio-feedback Exercise Program (PEER) study, emphasizing its practical application in a fall-risk intervention program to promote physical activity among older adults. Additionally, KANDI outperforms state-of-the-art methods on the D4RL benchmark. These results underscore KANDI's potential to address key challenges in offline RL for healthcare applications, offering an effective solution for activity promotion intervention strategies in healthcare.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ICMLA 2025. 8 pages, 6 figures</p></details> |

In this paper, we study the use of offline reinforcement learning as a practical and efficient alternative. This technique uses pre-collected data to enable emotion-adaptive social robots. We present a system architecture that integrates multimodal sensing and recognition, decision-making, and adaptive responses. Using a limited dataset from a human-robot game-playing scenario, we establish a benchmark for comparing offline reinforcement learning algorithms that do not require an online environment. Our results show that BCQ and CQL are more robust to data sparsity, achieving higher state-action values compared to NFQ, DQN, and DDQN. This work establishes a foundation for benchmarking offline RL in emotion-adaptive robotics and informs future deployment in real-world HRI.

IL algorithms often necessitate access to state and action information from expert demonstrations. Although expert actions can provide detailed guidance, requiring such action information may prove impractical for real-world applications where expert actions are difficult to obtain. To address this limitation, the concept of learning from observation (LfO) or state-only imitation learning (SOIL) has recently gained attention, wherein the imitator only has access to expert state visitation information. In this paper, we present a framework for LfO and use it to survey and classify existing LfO methods in terms of their trajectory construction, assumptions and algorithm's design choices. This survey also draws connections between several related fields like offline RL, model-based RL and hierarchical RL. Finally, we use our framework to identify open problems and suggest future research directions.</p></details> |  |

Nevertheless, the limited endurance and communication range of UAVs necessitate intelligent trajectory planning. While reinforcement learning (RL) has been extensively explored for UAV trajectory optimization, its interactive nature entails high costs and risks in real-world environments. Offline RL mitigates these issues but remains susceptible to unstable training and heavily rely on expert-quality datasets. To address these challenges, we formulate a joint UAV trajectory planning and resource allocation problem to maximize energy efficiency of data collection. The resource allocation subproblem is first transformed into an equivalent linear programming formulation and solved optimally with polynomial-time complexity. Then, we propose a large language model (LLM)-empowered critic-regularized decision transformer (DT) framework, termed LLM-CRDT, to learn effective UAV control policies. In LLM-CRDT, we incorporate critic networks to regularize the DT model training, thereby integrating the sequence modeling capabilities of DT with critic-based value guidance to enable learning effective policies from suboptimal datasets. Furthermore, to mitigate the data-hungry nature of transformer models, we employ a pre-trained LLM as the transformer backbone of the DT model and adopt a parameter-efficient fine-tuning strategy, i.e., LoRA, enabling rapid adaptation to UAV control tasks with small-scale dataset and low computational overhead. Extensive simulations demonstrate that LLM-CRDT outperforms benchmark online and offline RL methods, achieving up to 36.7\% higher energy efficiency than the current state-of-the-art DT approaches.</p></details> | 14pages, 8 figures |

Standard reinforcement learning (RL) and imitation learning methods require expert supervision through human-designed reward functions or demonstrations for every new task. In contrast, ReWiND starts from a small demonstration dataset to learn: (1) a data-efficient, language-conditioned reward function that labels the dataset with rewards, and (2) a language-conditioned policy pre-trained with offline RL using these rewards. Given an unseen task variation, ReWiND fine-tunes the pre-trained policy using the learned reward function, requiring minimal online interaction. We show that ReWiND's reward model generalizes effectively to unseen tasks, outperforming baselines by up to 2.4x in reward generalization and policy alignment metrics. Finally, we demonstrate that ReWiND enables sample-efficient adaptation to new tasks, beating baselines by 2x in simulation and improving real-world pretrained bimanual policies by 5x, taking a step towards scalable, real-world robot learning.

| **[Multi-Fidelity Hybrid Reinforcement Learning via Information Gain Maximization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14848v1)** | 2025-09-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Optimizing a reinforcement learning (RL) policy typically requires extensive interactions with a high-fidelity simulator of the environment, which are often costly or impractical. Offline RL addresses this problem by allowing training from pre-collected data, but its effectiveness is strongly constrained by the size and quality of the dataset. Hybrid offline-online RL leverages both offline data and interactions with a single simulator of the environment. In many real-world scenarios, however, multiple simulators with varying levels of fidelity and computational cost are available. In this work, we study multi-fidelity hybrid RL for policy optimization under a fixed cost budget. We introduce multi-fidelity hybrid RL via information gain maximization (MF-HRL-IGM), a hybrid offline-online RL algorithm that implements fidelity selection based on information gain maximization through a bootstrapping approach. Theoretical analysis establishes the no-regret property of MF-HRL-IGM, while empirical evaluations demonstrate its superior performance compared to existing benchmarks.</p></details> |  |

However, it struggles to learn optimal policies from suboptimal, reward-labelled trajectories. In this study, we explore the use of conditional generative modelling to facilitate trajectory stitching given its high-quality data generation ability. Additionally, recent advancements in Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) have shown their linear complexity and competitive sequence modelling performance over Transformers. We leverage the Test-Time Training (TTT) layer, an RNN that updates hidden states during testing, to model trajectories in the form of DT. We introduce a unified framework, called Diffusion-Refined Decision TTT (DRDT3), to achieve performance beyond DT models. Specifically, we propose the Decision TTT (DT3) module, which harnesses the sequence modelling strengths of both self-attention and the TTT layer to capture recent contextual information and make coarse action predictions. DRDT3 iteratively refines the coarse action predictions through the generative diffusion model, progressively moving closer to the optimal actions. We further integrate DT3 with the diffusion model using a unified optimization objective. With experiments on multiple tasks in the D4RL benchmark, our DT3 model without diffusion refinement demonstrates improved performance over standard DT, while DRDT3 further achieves superior results compared to state-of-the-art DT-based and offline RL methods.</p></details> |  |

However, unstructured environments and dynamic interactions pose significant challenges to autonomous parking tasks. To address this problem, we propose SEG-Parking, a novel end-to-end offline reinforcement learning (RL) framework to achieve interaction-aware autonomous parking. Notably, a specialized parking dataset is constructed for parking scenarios, which include those without interference from the opposite vehicle (OV) and complex ones involving interactions with the OV. Based on this dataset, a goal-conditioned state encoder is pretrained to map the fused perception information into the latent space. Then, an offline RL policy is optimized with a conservative regularizer that penalizes out-of-distribution actions. Extensive closed-loop experiments are conducted in the high-fidelity CARLA simulator. Comparative results demonstrate the superior performance of our framework with the highest success rate and robust generalization to out-of-distribution parking scenarios. The related dataset and source code will be made publicly available after the paper is accepted.</p></details> |  |
| **[Mining the Long Tail: A Comparative Study of Data-Centric Criticality Metrics for Robust Offline Reinforcement Learning in Autonomous Motion Planning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18397v2)** | 2025-09-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Offline Reinforcement Learning (RL) presents a promising paradigm for training autonomous vehicle (AV) planning policies from large-scale, real-world driving logs. However, the extreme data imbalance in these logs, where mundane scenarios vastly outnumber rare "long-tail" events, leads to brittle and unsafe policies when using standard uniform data sampling. In this work, we address this challenge through a systematic, large-scale comparative study of data curation strategies designed to focus the learning process on information-rich samples. We investigate six distinct criticality weighting schemes which are categorized into three families: heuristic-based, uncertainty-based, and behavior-based. These are evaluated at two temporal scales, the individual timestep and the complete scenario. We train seven goal-conditioned Conservative Q-Learning (CQL) agents with a state-of-the-art, attention-based architecture and evaluate them in the high-fidelity Waymax simulator. Our results demonstrate that all data curation methods significantly outperform the baseline. Notably, data-driven curation using model uncertainty as a signal achieves the most significant safety improvements, reducing the collision rate by nearly three-fold (from 16.0% to 5.5%). Furthermore, we identify a clear trade-off where timestep-level weighting excels at reactive safety while scenario-level weighting improves long-horizon planning. Our work provides a comprehensive framework for data curation in Offline RL and underscores that intelligent, non-uniform sampling is a critical component for building safe and reliable autonomous agents.</p></details> |  |
| **[Unearthing Gems from Stones: Policy Optimization with Negative Sample Augmentation for LLM Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14403v4)** | 2025-09-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in reasoning language models have witnessed a paradigm shift from short to long CoT pattern. Given the substantial computational cost of rollouts in long CoT models, maximizing the utility of fixed training datasets becomes crucial. Our analysis reveals that negative responses contain valuable components such as self-reflection and error-correction steps, yet primary existing methods either completely discard negative samples (RFT) or apply equal penalization across all tokens (RL), failing to leverage these potential learning signals. In light of this, we propose Behavior Constrained Policy Gradient with Negative Sample Augmentation (BCPG-NSA), a fine-grained offline RL framework that encompasses three stages: 1) sample segmentation, 2) consensus-based step correctness assessment combining LLM and PRM judgers, and 3) policy optimization with NSA designed to effectively mine positive steps within negative samples. Experimental results show that BCPG-NSA outperforms baselines on several challenging math/coding reasoning benchmarks using the same training dataset, achieving improved sample efficiency and demonstrating robustness and scalability when extended to multiple iterations.</p></details> |  |

Although VLMs are fundamentally limited in their ability to solve control tasks due to their lack of action-conditioned training data, their capacity for image understanding allows them to provide valuable feedback in RL tasks by recognizing successful outcomes. A key challenge in Reinforcement Learning from AI Feedback (RLAIF) is determining how best to integrate VLM-derived signals into the learning process. We explore this question in the context of offline RL and introduce a class of methods called Sub-Trajectory Filtered Optimization (SFO). We identify three key insights. First, trajectory length plays a crucial role in offline RL, as full-trajectory preference learning exacerbates the stitching problem, necessitating the use of sub-trajectories. Second, even in Markovian environments, a non-Markovian reward signal from a sequence of images is required to assess trajectory improvement, as VLMs do not interpret control actions and must rely on visual cues over time. Third, a simple yet effective approach--filtered and weighted behavior cloning--consistently outperforms more complex RLHF-based methods. We propose Sub-Trajectory Filtered Behavior Cloning (SFBC), a method that leverages VLM feedback on sub-trajectories while incorporating a retrospective filtering mechanism that removes sub-trajectories preceding failures to improve robustness and prevent turbulence.

| **[Generalizing Beyond Suboptimality: Offline Reinforcement Learning Learns Effective Scheduling through Random Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10303v1)** | 2025-09-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The Job-Shop Scheduling Problem (JSP) and Flexible Job-Shop Scheduling Problem (FJSP), are canonical combinatorial optimization problems with wide-ranging applications in industrial operations. In recent years, many online reinforcement learning (RL) approaches have been proposed to learn constructive heuristics for JSP and FJSP. Although effective, these online RL methods require millions of interactions with simulated environments that may not capture real-world complexities, and their random policy initialization leads to poor sample efficiency. To address these limitations, we introduce Conservative Discrete Quantile Actor-Critic (CDQAC), a novel offline RL algorithm that learns effective scheduling policies directly from historical data, eliminating the need for costly online interactions, while maintaining the ability to improve upon suboptimal training data. CDQAC couples a quantile-based critic with a delayed policy update, estimating the return distribution of each machine-operation pair rather than selecting pairs outright. Our extensive experiments demonstrate CDQAC's remarkable ability to learn from diverse data sources. CDQAC consistently outperforms the original data-generating heuristics and surpasses state-of-the-art offline and online RL baselines. In addition, CDQAC is highly sample efficient, requiring only 10-20 training instances to learn high-quality policies. Surprisingly, we find that CDQAC performs better when trained on data generated by a random heuristic than when trained on higher-quality data from genetic algorithms and priority dispatching rules.</p></details> |  |

We present a Hybrid Adaptive Conformal Offline Reinforcement Learning (HACO) framework that separates risk calibration from preference optimization to generate conservative action recommendations at scale. In our setting, each step involves choosing among common coordination actions (e.g., which member to contact, by which modality, and whether to route to a specialized service) while controlling the near-term risk of adverse utilization events (e.g., unplanned emergency department visits or hospitalizations). Using a de-identified operational dataset from Waymark comprising 2.77 million sequential decisions across 168,126 patients, HACO (i) trains a lightweight risk model for adverse events, (ii) derives a conformal threshold to mask unsafe actions at a target risk level, and (iii) learns a preference policy on the resulting safe subset. We evaluate policies with a version-agnostic fitted Q evaluation (FQE) on stratified subsets and audit subgroup performance across age, sex, and race. HACO achieves strong risk discrimination (AUC ~0.81) with a calibrated threshold ( τ ~0.038 at α = 0.10), while maintaining high safe coverage. Subgroup analyses reveal systematic differences in estimated value across demographics, underscoring the importance of fairness auditing. Our results show that conformal risk gating integrates cleanly with offline RL to deliver conservative, auditable decision support for population health management teams.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 5 figures, 4 tables</p></details> |

However, recent studies show that SL methods lack the trajectory stitching capability, typically associated with temporal difference (TD)-based approaches. A question naturally surfaces: \textit{How can we endow SL methods with stitching capability and close its performance gap with TD learning?} To answer this question, we introduce $Q$-conditioned maximization supervised learning for offline goal-conditioned RL, which enhances SL with the stitching capability through $Q$-conditioned policy and $Q$-conditioned maximization. Concretely, we propose \textbf{G}oal-\textbf{C}onditioned \textbf{\textit{Rein}}forced \textbf{S}upervised \textbf{L}earning (\textbf{GC\textit{Rein}SL}), which consists of (1) estimating the $Q$-function by Normalizing Flows from the offline dataset and (2) finding the maximum $Q$-value within the data support by integrating $Q$-function maximization with Expectile Regression. In inference time, our policy chooses optimal actions based on such a maximum $Q$-value. Experimental results from stitching evaluations on offline RL datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms prior SL approaches with stitching capabilities and goal data augmentation techniques.</p></details> |  |

Naively integrating these modules presents compatibility challenges when diffusion's multi-modal outputs behave adversarially to optimization-based modules. To address this, we introduce Joint Model-based Model-free Diffusion (JM2D), a novel generative modeling framework. JM2D formulates module integration as a joint sampling problem to maximize compatibility via an interaction potential, without additional training. Using importance sampling, JM2D guides modules outputs based only on evaluations of the interaction potential, thus handling non-differentiable objectives commonly arising from non-convex optimization modules. We evaluate JM2D via application to aligning diffusion planners with safety modules on offline RL and robot manipulation. JM2D significantly improves task performance compared to conventional safety filters without sacrificing safety. Further, we show that conditional generation is a special case of JM2D and elucidate key design choices by comparing with SOTA gradient-based and projection-based diffusion planners.

We introduce Policy-Aware Matrix Completion (PAMC) as a first concrete step toward a structural reward learning framework. Our key idea is to exploit approximate low-rank + sparse structure in the reward matrix, under policy-biased (MNAR) sampling. We prove recovery guarantees with inverse-propensity weighting, and establish a visitation-weighted error-to-regret bound linking completion error to control performance. Importantly, when assumptions weaken, PAMC degrades gracefully: confidence intervals widen and the algorithm abstains, ensuring safe fallback to exploration. Empirically, PAMC improves sample efficiency across Atari-26 (10M steps), DM Control, MetaWorld MT50, D4RL offline RL, and preference-based RL benchmarks, outperforming DrQ-v2, DreamerV3, Agent57, T-REX/D-REX, and PrefPPO under compute-normalized comparisons. Our results highlight PAMC as a practical and principled tool when structural rewards exist, and as a concrete first instantiation of a broader structural reward learning perspective.</p></details> |  |

Traditional heuristic approaches offer limited adaptability under dynamic networks, while online reinforcement learning (RL) suffers from high exploration costs and potential service disruptions. Offline RL, which leverages high-quality data collected from real-world environments, offers a promising alternative. However, challenges such as out-of-distribution (OOD) actions, policy extraction from behaviorally diverse datasets, and reliable deployment in production systems remain unsolved. We propose RBWE, a robust bandwidth estimation framework based on offline RL that integrates Q-ensemble (an ensemble of Q-functions) with a Gaussian mixture policy to mitigate OOD risks and enhance policy learning. A fallback mechanism ensures deployment stability by switching to heuristic methods under high uncertainty. Experimental results show that RBWE reduces overestimation errors by 18% and improves the 10th percentile Quality of Experience (QoE) by 18.6%, demonstrating its practical effectiveness in real-world RTC applications.

We focus on an offline setting where the agent has only a fixed dataset -- common in realistic tasks to prevent unsafe exploration. To address this, we propose Diffusion-Regularized Constrained Offline Reinforcement Learning (DRCORL), which first uses a diffusion model to capture the behavioral policy from offline data and then extracts a simplified policy to enable efficient inference. We further apply gradient manipulation for safety adaptation, balancing the reward objective and constraint satisfaction. This approach leverages high-quality offline data while incorporating safety requirements. Empirical results show that DRCORL achieves reliable safety performance, fast inference, and strong reward outcomes across robot learning tasks. Compared to existing safe offline RL methods, it consistently meets cost limits and performs well with the same hyperparameters, indicating practical applicability in real-world scenarios.</p></details> |  |
| **[Balancing Signal and Variance: Adaptive Offline RL Post-Training for VLA Flow Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04063v1)** | 2025-09-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models based on flow matching have shown excellent performance in general-purpose robotic manipulation tasks. However, the action accuracy of these models on complex downstream tasks is unsatisfactory. One important reason is that these models rely solely on the post-training paradigm of imitation learning, which makes it difficult to have a deeper understanding of the distribution properties of data quality, which is exactly what Reinforcement Learning (RL) excels at. In this paper, we theoretically propose an offline RL post-training objective for VLA flow models and induce an efficient and feasible offline RL fine-tuning algorithm -- Adaptive Reinforced Flow Matching (ARFM). By introducing an adaptively adjusted scaling factor in the VLA flow model loss, we construct a principled bias-variance trade-off objective function to optimally control the impact of RL signal on flow loss. ARFM adaptively balances RL advantage preservation and flow loss gradient variance control, resulting in a more stable and efficient fine-tuning process. Extensive simulation and real-world experimental results show that ARFM exhibits excellent generalization, robustness, few-shot learning, and continuous learning performance.</p></details> |  |

However, limited by the quality of offline datasets, it generally fails to learn well-qualified policies in suboptimal datasets. To address datasets with insufficient optimal demonstrations, we introduce Goal-cOnditioned Data Augmentation (GODA), a novel goal-conditioned diffusion-based method for augmenting samples with higher quality. Leveraging recent advancements in generative modelling, GODA incorporates a novel return-oriented goal condition with various selection mechanisms. Specifically, we introduce a controllable scaling technique to provide enhanced return-based guidance during data sampling. GODA learns a comprehensive distribution representation of the original offline datasets while generating new data with selectively higher-return goals, thereby maximizing the utility of limited optimal demonstrations. Furthermore, we propose a novel adaptive gated conditioning method for processing noisy inputs and conditions, enhancing the capture of goal-oriented guidance. We conduct experiments on the D4RL benchmark and real-world challenges, specifically traffic signal control (TSC) tasks, to demonstrate GODA's effectiveness in enhancing data quality and superior performance compared to state-of-the-art data augmentation methods across various offline RL algorithms.</p></details> |  |
| **[LLM-Driven Policy Diffusion: Enhancing Generalization in Offline Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00347v1)** | 2025-08-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement Learning (RL) is known for its strong decision-making capabilities and has been widely applied in various real-world scenarios. However, with the increasing availability of offline datasets and the lack of well-designed online environments from human experts, the challenge of generalization in offline RL has become more prominent. Due to the limitations of offline data, RL agents trained solely on collected experiences often struggle to generalize to new tasks or environments. To address this challenge, we propose LLM-Driven Policy Diffusion (LLMDPD), a novel approach that enhances generalization in offline RL using task-specific prompts. Our method incorporates both text-based task descriptions and trajectory prompts to guide policy learning. We leverage a large language model (LLM) to process text-based prompts, utilizing its natural language understanding and extensive knowledge base to provide rich task-relevant context. Simultaneously, we encode trajectory prompts using a transformer model, capturing structured behavioral patterns within the underlying transition dynamics. These prompts serve as conditional inputs to a context-aware policy-level diffusion model, enabling the RL agent to generalize effectively to unseen tasks. Our experimental results demonstrate that LLMDPD outperforms state-of-the-art offline RL methods on unseen tasks, highlighting its effectiveness in improving generalization and adaptability in diverse settings.</p></details> |  |

However, such static datasets often exhibit distribution bias, resulting in limited generalizability. To address this limitation, a straightforward solution is data augmentation (DA), which leverages generative models to enrich data distribution. Despite the promising results, current DA techniques focus solely on reconstructing future trajectories from given states, while ignoring the exploration of history transitions that reach them. This single-direction paradigm inevitably hinders the discovery of diverse behavior patterns, especially those leading to critical states that may have yielded high-reward outcomes. In this work, we introduce Bidirectional Trajectory Diffusion (BiTrajDiff), a novel DA framework for offline RL that models both future and history trajectories from any intermediate states. Specifically, we decompose the trajectory generation task into two independent yet complementary diffusion processes: one generating forward trajectories to predict future dynamics, and the other generating backward trajectories to trace essential history transitions.BiTrajDiff can efficiently leverage critical states as anchors to expand into potentially valuable yet underexplored regions of the state space, thereby facilitating dataset diversity. Extensive experiments on the D4RL benchmark suite demonstrate that BiTrajDiff achieves superior performance compared to other advanced DA methods across various offline RL backbones.</p></details> |  |

A key innovation is the Cascade Reinforcement Learning (Cascade RL) framework, which enhances reasoning through a two-stage process: offline RL for stable convergence and online RL for refined alignment. This coarse-to-fine training strategy leads to substantial improvements on downstream reasoning tasks, e.g., MMMU and MathVista. To optimize efficiency, we propose a Visual Resolution Router (ViR) that dynamically adjusts the resolution of visual tokens without compromising performance. Coupled with ViR, our Decoupled Vision-Language Deployment (DvD) strategy separates the vision encoder and language model across different GPUs, effectively balancing computational load. These contributions collectively enable InternVL3.5 to achieve up to a +16.0\% gain in overall reasoning performance and a 4.05$\times$ inference speedup compared to its predecessor, i.e., InternVL3. In addition, InternVL3.5 supports novel capabilities such as GUI interaction and embodied agency. Notably, our largest model, i.e., InternVL3.5-241B-A28B, attains state-of-the-art results among open-source MLLMs across general multimodal, reasoning, text, and agentic tasks -- narrowing the performance gap with leading commercial models like GPT-5.

| **[From Imitation to Optimization: A Comparative Study of Offline Learning for Autonomous Driving](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07029v2)** | 2025-08-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Learning robust driving policies from large-scale, real-world datasets is a central challenge in autonomous driving, as online data collection is often unsafe and impractical. While Behavioral Cloning (BC) offers a straightforward approach to imitation learning, policies trained with BC are notoriously brittle and suffer from compounding errors in closed-loop execution. This work presents a comprehensive pipeline and a comparative study to address this limitation. We first develop a series of increasingly sophisticated BC baselines, culminating in a Transformer-based model that operates on a structured, entity-centric state representation. While this model achieves low imitation loss, we show that it still fails in long-horizon simulations. We then demonstrate that by applying a state-of-the-art Offline Reinforcement Learning algorithm, Conservative Q-Learning (CQL), to the same data and architecture, we can learn a significantly more robust policy. Using a carefully engineered reward function, the CQL agent learns a conservative value function that enables it to recover from minor errors and avoid out-of-distribution states. In a large-scale evaluation on 1,000 unseen scenarios from the Waymo Open Motion Dataset, our final CQL agent achieves a 3.2x higher success rate and a 7.4x lower collision rate than the strongest BC baseline, proving that an offline RL approach is critical for learning robust, long-horizon driving policies from static expert data.</p></details> |  |

Existing methods typically employ policy constraints to mitigate the distribution shift encountered during offline RL training. However, because the scale of the constraints varies across tasks and datasets of differing quality, existing methods must meticulously tune hyperparameters to match each dataset, which is time-consuming and often impractical. We propose Adaptive Scaling of Policy Constraints (ASPC), a second-order differentiable framework that dynamically balances RL and behavior cloning (BC) during training. We theoretically analyze its performance improvement guarantee. In experiments on 39 datasets across four D4RL domains, ASPC using a single hyperparameter configuration outperforms other adaptive constraint methods and state-of-the-art offline RL algorithms that require per-dataset tuning while incurring only minimal computational overhead. The code will be released at https://github.com/Colin-Jing/ASPC.</p></details> |  |

This limitation makes it difficult for agents to generalize and achieve high performance, as they must learn primarily from imperfect or inconsistent trajectories. A central challenge is therefore how to best leverage scarce expert demonstrations alongside abundant but lower-quality data. We demonstrate that incorporating even a tiny amount of expert experience can substantially improve RL agent performance. We introduce Re:Frame (Retrieving Experience From Associative Memory), a plug-in module that augments a standard offline RL policy (e.g., Decision Transformer) with a small external Associative Memory Buffer (AMB) populated by expert trajectories drawn from a separate dataset. During training on low-quality data, the policy learns to retrieve expert data from the Associative Memory Buffer (AMB) via content-based associations and integrate them into decision-making; the same AMB is queried at evaluation. This requires no environment interaction and no modifications to the backbone architecture. On D4RL MuJoCo tasks, using as few as 60 expert trajectories (0.1% of a 6000-trajectory dataset), Re:Frame consistently improves over a strong Decision Transformer baseline in three of four settings, with gains up to +10.7 normalized points. These results show that Re:Frame offers a simple and data-efficient way to inject scarce expert knowledge and substantially improve offline RL from low-quality datasets.</p></details> | 11 pages, 3 figures |

This could generate reliability issues in safety-critical applications, such as in some multiagent domains where agents, and possibly humans, need to interact to reach their goals without harming each other. In this work, we propose a novel offline RL approach, inspired by Seldonian optimization, which returns policies with good performance and statistically guaranteed properties with respect to predefined desirable behaviors. In particular, our focus is on Ad Hoc Teamwork settings, where agents must collaborate with new teammates without prior coordination. Our method requires only a pre-collected dataset, a set of candidate policies for our agent, and a specification about the possible policies followed by the other players -- it does not require further interactions, training, or assumptions on the type and architecture of the policies. We test our algorithm in Ad Hoc Teamwork problems and show that it consistently finds reliable policies while improving sample efficiency with respect to standard ML baselines.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prese...</summary><p>Presented at the 2nd Reinforcement Learning Conference (RLC2025), Edmonton, Canada.

| **[Synthetic Data is Sufficient for Zero-Shot Visual Generalization from Offline Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12356v1)** | 2025-08-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Offline reinforcement learning (RL) offers a promising framework for training agents using pre-collected datasets without the need for further environment interaction. However, policies trained on offline data often struggle to generalise due to limited exposure to diverse states. The complexity of visual data introduces additional challenges such as noise, distractions, and spurious correlations, which can misguide the policy and increase the risk of overfitting if the training data is not sufficiently diverse. Indeed, this makes it challenging to leverage vision-based offline data in training robust agents that can generalize to unseen environments. To solve this problem, we propose a simple approach generating additional synthetic training data. We propose a two-step process, first augmenting the originally collected offline data to improve zero-shot generalization by introducing diversity, then using a diffusion model to generate additional data in latent space. We test our method across both continuous action spaces (Visual D4RL) and discrete action spaces (Procgen), demonstrating that it significantly improves generalization without requiring any algorithmic changes to existing model-free offline RL methods. We show that our method not only increases the diversity of the training data but also significantly reduces the generalization gap at test time while maintaining computational efficiency. We believe this approach could fuel additional progress in generating synthetic data to train more general agents in the future.</p></details> |  |

While algorithm development has progressed rapidly, significant theoretical advances have also been made in understanding the fundamental challenges of offline RL. However, bridging these theoretical insights with practical algorithm design remains an ongoing challenge. In this survey, we explore key intuitions derived from theoretical work and their implications for offline RL algorithms. We begin by listing the conditions needed for the proofs, including function representation and data coverage assumptions. Function representation conditions tell us what to expect for generalization, and data coverage assumptions describe the quality requirement of the data. We then examine counterexamples, where offline RL is not solvable without an impractically large amount of data. These cases highlight what cannot be achieved for all algorithms and the inherent hardness of offline RL. Building on techniques to mitigate these challenges, we discuss the conditions that are sufficient for offline RL. These conditions are not merely assumptions for theoretical proofs, but they also reveal the limitations of these algorithms and remind us to search for novel solutions when the conditions cannot be satisfied.</p></details> |  |
| **[MORE-CLEAR: Multimodal Offline Reinforcement learning for Clinical notes Leveraged Enhanced State Representation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07681v1)** | 2025-08-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Sepsis, a life-threatening inflammatory response to infection, causes organ dysfunction, making early detection and optimal management critical. Previous reinforcement learning (RL) approaches to sepsis management rely primarily on structured data, such as lab results or vital signs, and on a dearth of a comprehensive understanding of the patient's condition. In this work, we propose a Multimodal Offline REinforcement learning for Clinical notes Leveraged Enhanced stAte Representation (MORE-CLEAR) framework for sepsis control in intensive care units. MORE-CLEAR employs pre-trained large-scale language models (LLMs) to facilitate the extraction of rich semantic representations from clinical notes, preserving clinical context and improving patient state representation. Gated fusion and cross-modal attention allow dynamic weight adjustment in the context of time and the effective integration of multimodal data. Extensive cross-validation using two public (MIMIC-III and MIMIC-IV) and one private dataset demonstrates that MORE-CLEAR significantly improves estimated survival rate and policy performance compared to single-modal RL approaches. To our knowledge, this is the first to leverage LLM capabilities within a multimodal offline RL for better state representation in medical applications. This approach can potentially expedite the treatment and management of sepsis by enabling reinforcement learning models to propose enhanced actions based on a more comprehensive understanding of patient conditions.</p></details> | 18 pages, 5 figures |

In contrast, offline RL leverages extensive pre-collected data to learn policies, but often produces suboptimal results due to limited data coverage. Recent efforts integrate offline and online RL in order to harness the advantages of both approaches. However, effectively combining online and offline RL remains challenging due to issues that include catastrophic forgetting, lack of robustness to data quality and limited sample efficiency in data utilization. In an effort to address these challenges, we introduce A3RL, which incorporates a novel confidence aware Active Advantage Aligned (A3) sampling strategy that dynamically prioritizes data aligned with the policy's evolving needs from both online and offline sources, optimizing policy improvement. Moreover, we provide theoretical insights into the effectiveness of our active sampling strategy and conduct diverse empirical experiments and ablation studies, demonstrating that our method outperforms competing online RL techniques that leverage offline data.</p></details> |  |
| **[Mildly Conservative Regularized Evaluation for Offline Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05960v1)** | 2025-08-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Offline reinforcement learning (RL) seeks to learn optimal policies from static datasets without further environment interaction. A key challenge is the distribution shift between the learned and behavior policies, leading to out-of-distribution (OOD) actions and overestimation. To prevent gross overestimation, the value function must remain conservative; however, excessive conservatism may hinder performance improvement. To address this, we propose the mildly conservative regularized evaluation (MCRE) framework, which balances conservatism and performance by combining temporal difference (TD) error with a behavior cloning term in the Bellman backup. Building on this, we develop the mildly conservative regularized Q-learning (MCRQ) algorithm, which integrates MCRE into an off-policy actor-critic framework. Experiments show that MCRQ outperforms strong baselines and state-of-the-art offline RL algorithms on benchmark datasets.</p></details> |  |
| **[Learning to Reason for Factuality](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05618v1)** | 2025-08-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reasoning Large Language Models (R-LLMs) have significantly advanced complex reasoning tasks but often struggle with factuality, generating substantially more hallucinations than their non-reasoning counterparts on long-form factuality benchmarks. However, extending online Reinforcement Learning (RL), a key component in recent R-LLM advancements, to the long-form factuality setting poses several unique challenges due to the lack of reliable verification methods. Previous work has utilized automatic factuality evaluation frameworks such as FActScore to curate preference data in the offline RL setting, yet we find that directly leveraging such methods as the reward in online RL leads to reward hacking in multiple ways, such as producing less detailed or relevant responses. We propose a novel reward function that simultaneously considers the factual precision, response detail level, and answer relevance, and applies online RL to learn high quality factual reasoning. Evaluated on six long-form factuality benchmarks, our factual reasoning model achieves an average reduction of 23.1 percentage points in hallucination rate, a 23% increase in answer detail level, and no degradation in the overall response helpfulness.</p></details> |  |

This makes it ideal for real-world robots and safety-critical scenarios, where collecting online data or expert demonstrations is slow, costly, and risky. However, most existing offline RL works assume the dataset is already labeled with the task rewards, a process that often requires significant human effort, especially when ground-truth states are hard to ascertain (e.g., in the real-world). In this paper, we build on prior work, specifically RL-VLM-F, and propose a novel system that automatically generates reward labels for offline datasets using preference feedback from a vision-language model and a text description of the task. Our method then learns a policy using offline RL with the reward-labeled dataset. We demonstrate the system's applicability to a complex real-world robot-assisted dressing task, where we first learn a reward function using a vision-language model on a sub-optimal offline dataset, and then we use the learned reward to employ Implicit Q learning to develop an effective dressing policy. Our method also performs well in simulation tasks involving the manipulation of rigid and deformable objects, and significantly outperform baselines such as behavior cloning and inverse RL. In summary, we propose a new system that enables automatic reward labeling and policy learning from unlabeled, sub-optimal offline datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages.

| **[CO-RFT: Efficient Fine-Tuning of Vision-Language-Action Models through Chunked Offline Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02219v1)** | 2025-08-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models demonstrate significant potential for developing generalized policies in real-world robotic control. This progress inspires researchers to explore fine-tuning these models with Reinforcement Learning (RL). However, fine-tuning VLA models with RL still faces challenges related to sample efficiency, compatibility with action chunking, and training stability. To address these challenges, we explore the fine-tuning of VLA models through offline reinforcement learning incorporating action chunking. In this work, we propose Chunked RL, a novel reinforcement learning framework specifically designed for VLA models. Within this framework, we extend temporal difference (TD) learning to incorporate action chunking, a prominent characteristic of VLA models. Building upon this framework, we propose CO-RFT, an algorithm aimed at fine-tuning VLA models using a limited set of demonstrations (30 to 60 samples). Specifically, we first conduct imitation learning (IL) with full parameter fine-tuning to initialize both the backbone and the policy. Subsequently, we implement offline RL with action chunking to optimize the pretrained policy. Our empirical results in real-world environments demonstrate that CO-RFT outperforms previous supervised methods, achieving a 57% improvement in success rate and a 22.3% reduction in cycle time. Moreover, our method exhibits robust positional generalization capabilities, attaining a success rate of 44.3% in previously unseen positions.</p></details> |  |

This paper introduces Code Quality Score (CQS) system to automatically detect issues with a set of code changes and provide actionable insights. At its core, the CQS system is powered by two Llama3 models, fine-tuned (with SFT and offline RL approaches), to a) detect common code quality issues related to coding best practices and b) to provide good ``critiques'' for LLM-generated code review respectively. To maintain good user experience, we layer the system with hand-crafted rules to filter out incorrect responses/hallucinations. Offline evaluations show that our CQS system is able to achieve an impressive precision rate for identifying valid issues. This system has already been rolled out to developers in an industrial scale setting and has consistently achieved 60\% week over week user helpfulness rate, demonstrating its effectiveness in a real-world environment. In this paper, we present details of the CQS system along with some learnings on curating developer feedback to create training data for LLM fine-tuning.</p></details> | <details><summary>24 pa...</summary><p>24 pages, ICLR format</p></details> |

This is particularly useful in safety-critical real-world applications, where online data collection is expensive and impractical. However, existing offline RL algorithms typically require reward labeled data, which introduces an additional bottleneck: reward function design is itself costly, labor-intensive, and requires significant domain expertise. In this paper, we introduce PLARE, a novel approach that leverages large vision-language models (VLMs) to provide guidance signals for agent training. Instead of relying on manually designed reward functions, PLARE queries a VLM for preference labels on pairs of visual trajectory segments based on a language task description. The policy is then trained directly from these preference labels using a supervised contrastive preference learning objective, bypassing the need to learn explicit reward models. Through extensive experiments on robotic manipulation tasks from the MetaWorld, PLARE achieves performance on par with or surpassing existing state-of-the-art VLM-based reward generation methods. Furthermore, we demonstrate the effectiveness of PLARE in real-world manipulation tasks with a physical robot, further validating its practical applicability.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to IROS 2025</p></details> |

AI research in CPS has been led by heuristic tree search and online self-play, but the game may also create a platform to study adaptive policies trained offline on large datasets. We develop a pipeline to reconstruct the first-person perspective of an agent from logs saved from the third-person perspective of a spectator, thereby unlocking a dataset of real human battles spanning more than a decade that grows larger every day. This dataset enables a black-box approach where we train large sequence models to adapt to their opponent based solely on their input trajectory while selecting moves without explicit search of any kind. We study a progression from imitation learning to offline RL and offline fine-tuning on self-play data in the hardcore competitive setting of Pokémon's four oldest (and most partially observed) game generations. The resulting agents outperform a recent LLM Agent approach and a strong heuristic search engine. While playing anonymously in online battles against humans, our best agents climb to rankings inside the top 10% of active players.

| **[Safe Deployment of Offline Reinforcement Learning via Input Convex Action Correction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22640v1)** | 2025-07-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Offline reinforcement learning (offline RL) offers a promising framework for developing control strategies in chemical process systems using historical data, without the risks or costs of online experimentation. This work investigates the application of offline RL to the safe and efficient control of an exothermic polymerisation continuous stirred-tank reactor. We introduce a Gymnasium-compatible simulation environment that captures the reactor's nonlinear dynamics, including reaction kinetics, energy balances, and operational constraints. The environment supports three industrially relevant scenarios: startup, grade change down, and grade change up. It also includes reproducible offline datasets generated from proportional-integral controllers with randomised tunings, providing a benchmark for evaluating offline RL algorithms in realistic process control tasks. We assess behaviour cloning and implicit Q-learning as baseline algorithms, highlighting the challenges offline agents face, including steady-state offsets and degraded performance near setpoints. To address these issues, we propose a novel deployment-time safety layer that performs gradient-based action correction using input convex neural networks (PICNNs) as learned cost models. The PICNN enables real-time, differentiable correction of policy actions by descending a convex, state-conditioned cost surface, without requiring retraining or environment interaction. Experimental results show that offline RL, particularly when combined with convex action correction, can outperform traditional control approaches and maintain stability across all scenarios. These findings demonstrate the feasibility of integrating offline RL with interpretable and safety-aware corrections for high-stakes chemical process control, and lay the groundwork for more reliable data-driven automation in industrial systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[The Pitfalls of Imitation Learning when Actions are Continuous](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09722v4)** | 2025-07-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We study the problem of imitating an expert demonstrator in a discrete-time, continuous state-and-action control system. We show that, even if the dynamics satisfy a control-theoretic property called exponential stability (i.e. the effects of perturbations decay exponentially quickly), and the expert is smooth and deterministic, any smooth, deterministic imitator policy necessarily suffers error on execution that is exponentially larger, as a function of problem horizon, than the error under the distribution of expert training data. Our negative result applies to any algorithm which learns solely from expert data, including both behavior cloning and offline-RL algorithms, unless the algorithm produces highly "improper" imitator policies--those which are non-smooth, non-Markovian, or which exhibit highly state-dependent stochasticity--or unless the expert trajectory distribution is sufficiently "spread." We provide experimental evidence of the benefits of these more complex policy parameterizations, explicating the benefits of today's popular policy parameterizations in robot learning (e.g. action-chunking and diffusion policies). We also establish a host of complementary negative and positive results for imitation in control systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>98 pa...</summary><p>98 pages, 2 figures, updated proof sketch</p></details> |

We propose the \textit{Single-Step Completion Policy} (SSCP), a generative policy trained with an augmented flow-matching objective to predict direct completion vectors from intermediate flow samples, enabling accurate, one-shot action generation. In an off-policy actor-critic framework, SSCP combines the expressiveness of generative models with the training and inference efficiency of unimodal policies, without requiring long backpropagation chains. Our method scales effectively to offline, offline-to-online, and online RL settings, offering substantial gains in speed and adaptability over diffusion-based baselines. We further extend SSCP to goal-conditioned RL, enabling flat policies to exploit subgoal structures without explicit hierarchical inference. SSCP achieves strong results across standard offline RL and behavior cloning benchmarks, positioning it as a versatile, expressive, and efficient framework for deep RL and sequential decision-making.</p></details> |  |
| **[Pragmatic Policy Development via Interpretable Behavior Cloning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17056v1)** | 2025-07-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Offline reinforcement learning (RL) holds great promise for deriving optimal policies from observational data, but challenges related to interpretability and evaluation limit its practical use in safety-critical domains. Interpretability is hindered by the black-box nature of unconstrained RL policies, while evaluation -- typically performed off-policy -- is sensitive to large deviations from the data-collecting behavior policy, especially when using methods based on importance sampling. To address these challenges, we propose a simple yet practical alternative: deriving treatment policies from the most frequently chosen actions in each patient state, as estimated by an interpretable model of the behavior policy. By using a tree-based model, which is specifically designed to exploit patterns in the data, we obtain a natural grouping of states with respect to treatment. The tree structure ensures interpretability by design, while varying the number of actions considered controls the degree of overlap with the behavior policy, enabling reliable off-policy evaluation. This pragmatic approach to policy development standardizes frequent treatment patterns, capturing the collective clinical judgment embedded in the data. Using real-world examples in rheumatoid arthritis and sepsis care, we demonstrate that policies derived under this framework can outperform current practice, offering interpretable alternatives to those obtained via offline RL.</p></details> |  |

By pulling together state-action pairs and their corresponding future states, while pushing apart negative pairs, CRL enables learning nontrivial policies without manually designed rewards. In this work, we propose Equivariant CRL (ECRL), which further structures the latent space using equivariant constraints. By leveraging inherent symmetries in goal-conditioned manipulation tasks, our method improves both sample efficiency and spatial generalization. Specifically, we formally define Goal-Conditioned Group-Invariant MDPs to characterize rotation-symmetric robotic manipulation tasks, and build on this by introducing a novel rotation-invariant critic representation paired with a rotation-equivariant actor for Contrastive RL. Our approach consistently outperforms strong baselines across a range of simulated tasks in both state-based and image-based settings. Finally, we extend our method to the offline RL setting, demonstrating its effectiveness across multiple tasks.</p></details> |  |

However, the explosion of model complexity in emerging applications and the presence of nonconvexity exacerbate the challenge of achieving efficient RL in sample-starved situations, where data collection is expensive, time-consuming, or even high-stakes (e.g., in clinical trials, autonomous systems, and online advertising). How to understand and enhance the sample and computational efficacies of RL algorithms is thus of great interest. In this tutorial, we aim to introduce several important algorithmic and theoretical developments in RL, highlighting the connections between new ideas and classical topics. Employing Markov Decision Processes as the central mathematical model, we cover several distinctive RL scenarios (i.e., RL with a simulator, online RL, offline RL, robust RL, and RL with human feedback), and present several mainstream RL approaches (i.e., model-based approach, value-based approach, and policy optimization).

The Prompting Decision Transformer (PDT) enables large-scale, multi-task offline Reinforcement Learning (RL) pre-training by leveraging stochastic trajectory prompts to identify the target task. However, these prompts are sampled uniformly from expert demonstrations, overlooking a critical limitation: not all prompts are equally informative for differentiating between tasks. This limits generalization and adaptation, especially in low-data or open-world settings where sample efficiency is crucial. To address this issue, we propose a lightweight, inference-time, bandit-based prompt-tuning framework. The bandit explores and optimizes trajectory prompt selection to enhance task performance, while avoiding costly fine-tuning of the transformer backbone. Our experiments indicate not only clear performance gains due to bandit-based prompt-tuning, but also better sample complexity, scalability, and prompt space exploration compared to prompt-tuning baselines. These results highlights the importance of adaptive prompt selection mechanisms for efficient generalization in offline multi-task RL.</p></details> |  |

Building on recent advances in step-wise reinforcement learning, we introduce a dual-objective reward system that simultaneously optimizes for answer quality and tool diversity, training a Llama-3.1 8B model through offline PPO on synthetically generated trajectories from the MMLU-Pro dataset. Our approach uniquely employs a rarity-first exploitation strategy where a GPT-4o judge scores candidate actions across eight distinct tools plus chain-of-thought reasoning, with the policy favoring less-frequently used but still viable tools to encourage systematic exploration. Empirical results demonstrate that SPaRK achieves competitive performance across 14 MMLU-Pro categories while exhibiting significantly higher entropy in tool selection compared to both baseline and supervised fine-tuning approaches, suggesting that algorithmic exploration through explicit tool diversity can enhance reasoning capabilities without sacrificing accuracy.</p></details> | 12 pages, 4 figures |
| **[Offline Reinforcement Learning with Wasserstein Regularization via Optimal Transport Maps](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10843v1)** | 2025-07-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Offline reinforcement learning (RL) aims to learn an optimal policy from a static dataset, making it particularly valuable in scenarios where data collection is costly, such as robotics. A major challenge in offline RL is distributional shift, where the learned policy deviates from the dataset distribution, potentially leading to unreliable out-of-distribution actions. To mitigate this issue, regularization techniques have been employed. While many existing methods utilize density ratio-based measures, such as the $f$-divergence, for regularization, we propose an approach that utilizes the Wasserstein distance, which is robust to out-of-distribution data and captures the similarity between actions. Our method employs input-convex neural networks (ICNNs) to model optimal transport maps, enabling the computation of the Wasserstein distance in a discriminator-free manner, thereby avoiding adversarial training and ensuring stable learning. Our approach demonstrates comparable or superior performance to widely used existing methods on the D4RL benchmark dataset.

This confines the algorithms to a specific state-action distribution present in the dataset, reducing the effects of distributional shift but restricting the policy to seen actions. In this paper, we alleviate this limitation by introducing state-constrained offline RL, a novel framework that focuses solely on the dataset's state distribution. This approach allows the policy to take high-quality out-of-distribution actions that lead to in-distribution states, significantly enhancing learning potential. The proposed setting not only broadens the learning horizon but also improves the ability to combine different trajectories from the dataset effectively, a desirable property inherent in offline RL. Our research is underpinned by theoretical findings that pave the way for subsequent advancements in this area. Additionally, we introduce StaCQ, a deep learning algorithm that achieves state-of-the-art performance on the D4RL benchmark datasets and aligns with our theoretical propositions. StaCQ establishes a strong baseline for forthcoming explorations in this domain.</p></details> |  |

Among these, Decision Transformer (DT) has gained particular attention in the context of offline reinforcement learning due to its ability to frame return-conditioned policy learning as a sequence modeling task. Most recently, Bhargava et al. (2024) provided a systematic comparison of DT with more conventional MLP-based offline RL algorithms, including Behavior Cloning (BC) and Conservative Q-Learning (CQL), and claimed that DT exhibits superior performance in sparse-reward and low-quality data settings. In this paper, through experimentation on robotic manipulation tasks (Robomimic) and locomotion benchmarks (D4RL), we show that MLP-based Filtered Behavior Cloning (FBC) achieves competitive or superior performance compared to DT in sparse-reward environments. FBC simply filters out low-performing trajectories from the dataset and then performs ordinary behavior cloning on the filtered dataset. FBC is not only very straightforward, but it also requires less training data and is computationally more efficient. The results therefore suggest that DT is not preferable for sparse-reward environments. From prior work, arguably, DT is also not preferable for dense-reward environments. Thus, we pose the question: Is DT ever preferable?</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by RLBrew: Ingredients for Developing Generalist Agents workshop (RLC 2025)</p></details> |
| **[Offline Trajectory Optimization for Offline Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10393v2)** | 2025-07-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Offline reinforcement learning (RL) aims to learn policies without online explorations. To enlarge the training data, model-based offline RL learns a dynamics model which is utilized as a virtual environment to generate simulation data and enhance policy learning. However, existing data augmentation methods for offline RL suffer from (i) trivial improvement from short-horizon simulation; and (ii) the lack of evaluation and correction for generated data, leading to low-qualified augmentation. In this paper, we propose offline trajectory optimization for offline reinforcement learning (OTTO). The key motivation is to conduct long-horizon simulation and then utilize model uncertainty to evaluate and correct the augmented data. Specifically, we propose an ensemble of Transformers, a.k.a. World Transformers, to predict environment state dynamics and the reward function. Three strategies are proposed to use World Transformers to generate long-horizon trajectory simulation by perturbing the actions in the offline data. Then, an uncertainty-based World Evaluator is introduced to firstly evaluate the confidence of the generated trajectories and then perform the correction for low-confidence data. Finally, we jointly use the original data with the corrected augmentation data to train an offline RL algorithm. OTTO serves as a plug-in module and can be integrated with existing model-free offline RL methods. Experiments on various benchmarks show that OTTO can effectively improve the performance of representative offline RL algorithms, including in complex environments with sparse rewards like AntMaze.

| **[Multi-task Offline Reinforcement Learning for Online Advertising in Recommender Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23090v2)** | 2025-07-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Online advertising in recommendation platforms has gained significant attention, with a predominant focus on channel recommendation and budget allocation strategies. However, current offline reinforcement learning (RL) methods face substantial challenges when applied to sparse advertising scenarios, primarily due to severe overestimation, distributional shifts, and overlooking budget constraints. To address these issues, we propose MTORL, a novel multi-task offline RL model that targets two key objectives. First, we establish a Markov Decision Process (MDP) framework specific to the nuances of advertising. Then, we develop a causal state encoder to capture dynamic user interests and temporal dependencies, facilitating offline RL through conditional sequence modeling. Causal attention mechanisms are introduced to enhance user sequence representations by identifying correlations among causal states. We employ multi-task learning to decode actions and rewards, simultaneously addressing channel recommendation and budget allocation. Notably, our framework includes an automated system for integrating these tasks into online advertising. Extensive experiments on offline and online environments demonstrate MTORL's superiority over state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> | KDD 2025 |
| **[Risk-sensitive Actor-Critic with Static Spectral Risk Measures for Online and Offline Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03900v1)** | 2025-07-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The development of Distributional Reinforcement Learning (DRL) has introduced a natural way to incorporate risk sensitivity into value-based and actor-critic methods by employing risk measures other than expectation in the value function. While this approach is widely adopted in many online and offline RL algorithms due to its simplicity, the naive integration of risk measures often results in suboptimal policies. This limitation can be particularly harmful in scenarios where the need for effective risk-sensitive policies is critical and worst-case outcomes carry severe consequences. To address this challenge, we propose a novel framework for optimizing static Spectral Risk Measures (SRM), a flexible family of risk measures that generalizes objectives such as CVaR and Mean-CVaR, and enables the tailoring of risk preferences. Our method is applicable to both online and offline RL algorithms. We establish theoretical guarantees by proving convergence in the finite state-action setting. Moreover, through extensive empirical evaluations, we demonstrate that our algorithms consistently outperform existing risk-sensitive methods in both online and offline environments across diverse domains.</p></details> |  |
| **[Offline Reinforcement Learning for Learning to Dispatch for Job Shop Scheduling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10589v4)** | 2025-07-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The Job Shop Scheduling Problem (JSSP) is a complex combinatorial optimization problem. While online Reinforcement Learning (RL) has shown promise by quickly finding acceptable solutions for JSSP, it faces key limitations: it requires extensive training interactions from scratch leading to sample inefficiency, cannot leverage existing high-quality solutions from traditional methods like Constraint Programming (CP), and require simulated environments to train in, which are impracticable to build for complex scheduling environments. We introduce Offline Learned Dispatching (Offline-LD), an offline reinforcement learning approach for JSSP, which addresses these limitations by learning from historical scheduling data. Our approach is motivated by scenarios where historical scheduling data and expert solutions are available or scenarios where online training of RL approaches with simulated environments is impracticable. Offline-LD introduces maskable variants of two Q-learning methods, namely, Maskable Quantile Regression DQN (mQRDQN) and discrete maskable Soft Actor-Critic (d-mSAC), that are able to learn from historical data, through Conservative Q-Learning (CQL). Moreover, we present a novel entropy bonus modification for d-mSAC, for maskable action spaces. Moreover, we introduce a novel reward normalization method for JSSP in an offline RL setting. Our experiments demonstrate that Offline-LD outperforms online RL on both generated and benchmark instances when trained on only 100 solutions generated by CP. Notably, introducing noise to the expert dataset yields comparable or superior results to using the expert dataset, with the same amount of instances, a promising finding for real-world applications, where data is inherently noisy and imperfect.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in Machine Learning</p></details> |
| **[Offline Reinforcement Learning with Penalized Action Noise Injection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02356v1)** | 2025-07-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Offline reinforcement learning (RL) optimizes a policy using only a fixed dataset, making it a practical approach in scenarios where interaction with the environment is costly. Due to this limitation, generalization ability is key to improving the performance of offline RL algorithms, as demonstrated by recent successes of offline RL with diffusion models. However, it remains questionable whether such diffusion models are necessary for highly performing offline RL algorithms, given their significant computational requirements during inference. In this paper, we propose Penalized Action Noise Injection (PANI), a method that simply enhances offline learning by utilizing noise-injected actions to cover the entire action space, while penalizing according to the amount of noise injected. This approach is inspired by how diffusion models have worked in offline RL algorithms. We provide a theoretical foundation for this method, showing that offline RL algorithms with such noise-injected actions solve a modified Markov Decision Process (MDP), which we call the noisy action MDP. PANI is compatible with a wide range of existing off-policy and offline RL algorithms, and despite its simplicity, it demonstrates significant performance improvements across various benchmarks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Efficient Online Reinforcement Learning Fine-Tuning Need Not Retain Offline Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07762v3)** | 2025-07-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The modern paradigm in machine learning involves pre-training on diverse data, followed by task-specific fine-tuning. In reinforcement learning (RL), this translates to learning via offline RL on a diverse historical dataset, followed by rapid online RL fine-tuning using interaction data. Most RL fine-tuning methods require continued training on offline data for stability and performance. However, this is undesirable because training on diverse offline data is slow and expensive for large datasets, and in principle, also limit the performance improvement possible because of constraints or pessimism on offline data. In this paper, we show that retaining offline data is unnecessary as long as we use a properly-designed online RL approach for fine-tuning offline RL initializations. To build this approach, we start by analyzing the role of retaining offline data in online fine-tuning. We find that continued training on offline data is mostly useful for preventing a sudden divergence in the value function at the onset of fine-tuning, caused by a distribution mismatch between the offline data and online rollouts. This divergence typically results in unlearning and forgetting the benefits of offline pre-training. Our approach, Warm-start RL (WSRL), mitigates the catastrophic forgetting of pre-trained initializations using a very simple idea. WSRL employs a warmup phase that seeds the online RL run with a very small number of rollouts from the pre-trained policy to do fast online RL. The data collected during warmup helps ``recalibrate'' the offline Q-function to the online distribution, allowing us to completely discard offline data without destabilizing the online RL fine-tuning. We show that WSRL is able to fine-tune without retaining any offline data, and is able to learn faster and attains higher performance than existing algorithms irrespective of whether they retain offline data or not.</p></details> |  |
| **[Diffusion Policies for Risk-Averse Behavior Modeling in Offline Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17646v2)** | 2025-07-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Offline reinforcement learning (RL) presents distinct challenges as it relies solely on observational data. A central concern in this context is ensuring the safety of the learned policy by quantifying uncertainties associated with various actions and environmental stochasticity. Traditional approaches primarily emphasize mitigating epistemic uncertainty by learning risk-averse policies, often overlooking environmental stochasticity. In this study, we propose an uncertainty-aware distributional offline RL method to simultaneously address both epistemic uncertainty and environmental stochasticity. We propose a model-free offline RL algorithm capable of learning risk-averse policies and characterizing the entire distribution of discounted cumulative rewards, as opposed to merely maximizing the expected value of accumulated discounted returns. Our method is rigorously evaluated through comprehensive experiments in both risk-sensitive and risk-neutral benchmarks, demonstrating its superior performance.</p></details> | IROS 2025 |
| **[Reward Balancing Revisited: Enhancing Offline Reinforcement Learning for Recommender Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22112v2)** | 2025-06-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Offline reinforcement learning (RL) has emerged as a prevalent and effective methodology for real-world recommender systems, enabling learning policies from historical data and capturing user preferences. In offline RL, reward shaping encounters significant challenges, with past efforts to incorporate prior strategies for uncertainty to improve world models or penalize underexplored state-action pairs. Despite these efforts, a critical gap remains: the simultaneous balancing of intrinsic biases in world models and the diversity of policy recommendations. To address this limitation, we present an innovative offline RL framework termed Reallocated Reward for Recommender Systems (R3S). By integrating inherent model uncertainty to tackle the intrinsic fluctuations in reward predictions, we boost diversity for decision-making to align with a more interactive paradigm, incorporating extra penalizers with decay that deter actions leading to diminished state variety at both local and global scales. The experimental results demonstrate that R3S improves the accuracy of world models and efficiently harmonizes the heterogeneous preferences of the users.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in Companion Proceedings of the ACM Web Conference 2025</p></details> |

Such methods make use of collected offline datasets to learn the optimal policy, without further exploration. We adapt and apply a sequence-based method called Decision Transformers as well as a value-based method called Conservative Q-Learning to learn the optimal policy for the same target reward as the vanilla rule-based MRO. The same input features related to failures, ping-pongs, and other handover issues are used. Evaluation for realistic New Radio networks with 3500 MHz carrier frequency on a traffic mix including diverse user service types and a specific tunable cell-pair shows that offline-RL methods outperform rule-based MRO, offering up to 7% improvement. Furthermore, offline-RL can be trained for diverse objective functions using the same available dataset, thus offering operational flexibility compared to rule-based methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, double column, 4 figures, 6 tables, conference submission</p></details> |

While many common offline RL benchmarks employ datasets with over a million data points, many offline RL applications rely on considerably smaller datasets. We show that offline RL algorithms can overfit on small datasets, resulting in poor performance. To address this challenge, we introduce "Sparse-Reg": a regularization technique based on sparsity to mitigate overfitting in offline reinforcement learning, enabling effective learning in limited data settings and outperforming state-of-the-art baselines in continuous control.</p></details> |  |
| **[Optimal Single-Policy Sample Complexity and Transient Coverage for Average-Reward Offline RL](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20904v1)** | 2025-06-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We study offline reinforcement learning in average-reward MDPs, which presents increased challenges from the perspectives of distribution shift and non-uniform coverage, and has been relatively underexamined from a theoretical perspective. While previous work obtains performance guarantees under single-policy data coverage assumptions, such guarantees utilize additional complexity measures which are uniform over all policies, such as the uniform mixing time. We develop sharp guarantees depending only on the target policy, specifically the bias span and a novel policy hitting radius, yielding the first fully single-policy sample complexity bound for average-reward offline RL. We are also the first to handle general weakly communicating MDPs, contrasting restrictive structural assumptions made in prior work. To achieve this, we introduce an algorithm based on pessimistic discounted value iteration enhanced by a novel quantile clipping technique, which enables the use of a sharper empirical-span-based penalty function. Our algorithm also does not require any prior parameter knowledge for its implementation. Remarkably, we show via hard examples that learning under our conditions requires coverage assumptions beyond the stationary distribution of the target policy, distinguishing single-policy complexity measures from previously examined cases. We also develop lower bounds nearly matching our main result.</p></details> |  |
| **[Unsupervised Data Generation for Offline Reinforcement Learning: A Perspective from Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19643v1)** | 2025-06-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Offline reinforcement learning (RL) recently gains growing interests from RL researchers. However, the performance of offline RL suffers from the out-of-distribution problem, which can be corrected by feedback in online RL. Previous offline RL research focuses on restricting the offline algorithm in in-distribution even in-sample action sampling. In contrast, fewer work pays attention to the influence of the batch data. In this paper, we first build a bridge over the batch data and the performance of offline RL algorithms theoretically, from the perspective of model-based offline RL optimization. We draw a conclusion that, with mild assumptions, the distance between the state-action pair distribution generated by the behavioural policy and the distribution generated by the optimal policy, accounts for the performance gap between the policy learned by model-based offline RL and the optimal policy. Secondly, we reveal that in task-agnostic settings, a series of policies trained by unsupervised RL can minimize the worst-case regret in the performance gap. Inspired by the theoretical conclusions, UDG (Unsupervised Data Generation) is devised to generate data and select proper data for offline training under tasks-agnostic settings. Empirical results demonstrate that UDG can outperform supervised data generation on solving unknown tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Permutation Equivariant Model-based Offline Reinforcement Learning for Auto-bidding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17919v1)** | 2025-06-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement learning (RL) for auto-bidding has shifted from using simplistic offline simulators (Simulation-based RL Bidding, SRLB) to offline RL on fixed real datasets (Offline RL Bidding, ORLB). However, ORLB policies are limited by the dataset's state space coverage, offering modest gains. While SRLB expands state coverage, its simulator-reality gap risks misleading policies. This paper introduces Model-based RL Bidding (MRLB), which learns an environment model from real data to bridge this gap. MRLB trains policies using both real and model-generated data, expanding state coverage beyond ORLB. To ensure model reliability, we propose: 1) A permutation equivariant model architecture for better generalization, and 2) A robust offline Q-learning method that pessimistically penalizes model errors. These form the Permutation Equivariant Model-based Offline RL (PE-MORL) algorithm. Real-world experiments show that PE-MORL outperforms state-of-the-art auto-bidding methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[Fast and Stable Diffusion Planning through Variational Adaptive Weighting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16688v1)** | 2025-06-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models have recently shown promise in offline RL. However, these methods often suffer from high training costs and slow convergence, particularly when using transformer-based denoising backbones. While several optimization strategies have been proposed -- such as modified noise schedules, auxiliary prediction targets, and adaptive loss weighting -- challenges remain in achieving stable and efficient training. In particular, existing loss weighting functions typically rely on neural network approximators, which can be ineffective in early training phases due to limited generalization capacity of MLPs when exposed to sparse feedback in the early training stages. In this work, we derive a variationally optimal uncertainty-aware weighting function and introduce a closed-form polynomial approximation method for its online estimation under the flow-based generative modeling framework. We integrate our method into a diffusion planning pipeline and evaluate it on standard offline RL benchmarks. Experimental results on Maze2D and Kitchen tasks show that our method achieves competitive performance with up to 10 times fewer training steps, highlighting its practical effectiveness.</p></details> |  |
| **[CAWR: Corruption-Averse Advantage-Weighted Regression for Robust Policy Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15654v1)** | 2025-06-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Offline reinforcement learning (offline RL) algorithms often require additional constraints or penalty terms to address distribution shift issues, such as adding implicit or explicit policy constraints during policy optimization to reduce the estimation bias of functions. This paper focuses on a limitation of the Advantage-Weighted Regression family (AWRs), i.e., the potential for learning over-conservative policies due to data corruption, specifically the poor explorations in suboptimal offline data. We study it from two perspectives: (1) how poor explorations impact the theoretically optimal policy based on KL divergence, and (2) how such poor explorations affect the approximation of the theoretically optimal policy. We prove that such over-conservatism is mainly caused by the sensitivity of the loss function for policy optimization to poor explorations, and the proportion of poor explorations in offline datasets. To address this concern, we propose Corruption-Averse Advantage-Weighted Regression (CAWR), which incorporates a set of robust loss functions during policy optimization and an advantage-based prioritized experience replay method to filter out poor explorations. Numerical experiments on the D4RL benchmark show that our method can learn superior policies from suboptimal offline data, significantly enhancing the performance of policy optimization.</p></details> | 23 pages, 14 figures |

However, optimizing its settings remains a complex and error-prone process due to patient-specific variability. While Offline Reinforcement Learning (RL) shows promise for MV control, current stateof-the-art (SOTA) methods struggle with the hybrid (continuous and discrete) nature of MV actions. Discretizing the action space limits available actions due to exponential growth in combinations and introduces distribution shifts that can compromise safety. In this paper, we propose optimizations that build upon prior work in action space reduction to address the challenges of discrete action spaces. We also adapt SOTA offline RL algorithms (IQL and EDAC) to operate directly on hybrid action spaces, thereby avoiding the pitfalls of discretization. Additionally, we introduce a clinically grounded reward function based on ventilator-free days and physiological targets, which provides a more meaningful optimization objective compared to traditional sparse mortality-based rewards. Our findings demonstrate that AI-assisted MV optimization may enhance patient safety and enable individualized lung support, representing a significant advancement toward intelligent, data-driven critical care solutions.</p></details> | <details><summary>under...</summary><p>under review, PAIS track @ ECAI 2025</p></details> |

Existing explainability methods often focus on single states or entire trajectories, either providing only local, step-wise insights or attributing decisions to coarse, episodelevel summaries. Both approaches miss the recurring strategies and temporally extended patterns that actually drive agent behavior across multiple decisions. We address this gap by proposing a fully offline, reward-free framework for behavior discovery and segmentation, enabling the attribution of actions to meaningful and interpretable behavior segments that capture recurring patterns appearing across multiple trajectories. Our method identifies coherent behavior clusters from state-action sequences and attributes individual actions to these clusters for fine-grained, behavior-centric explanations. Evaluations on four diverse offline RL environments show that our approach discovers meaningful behaviors and outperforms trajectory-level baselines in fidelity, human preference, and cluster coherence. Our code is publicly available.</p></details> |  |

To solve this challenge, some robust RL algorithms have been proposed, but most are limited to tabular settings. In this work, we propose Distributionally Robust Soft Actor-Critic (DR-SAC), a novel algorithm designed to enhance the robustness of the state-of-the-art Soft Actor-Critic (SAC) algorithm. DR-SAC aims to maximize the expected value with entropy against the worst possible transition model lying in an uncertainty set. A distributionally robust version of the soft policy iteration is derived with a convergence guarantee. For settings where nominal distributions are unknown, such as offline RL, a generative modeling approach is proposed to estimate the required nominal distributions from data. Furthermore, experimental results on a range of continuous control benchmark tasks demonstrate our algorithm achieves up to $9.8$ times the average reward of the SAC baseline under common perturbations. Additionally, compared with existing robust reinforcement learning algorithms, DR-SAC significantly improves computing efficiency and applicability to large-scale problems.</p></details> | 24 Pages |

However, most previous PbRL work has not investigated the robustness to labeler errors, inevitable with labelers who are non-experts or operate under time constraints. Additionally, PbRL algorithms often target very specific settings (e.g. pairwise ranked preferences or purely offline learning). We introduce Similarity as Reward Alignment (SARA), a simple contrastive framework that is both resilient to noisy labels and adaptable to diverse feedback formats and training paradigms. SARA learns a latent representation of preferred samples and computes rewards as similarities to the learned latent. We demonstrate strong performance compared to baselines on continuous control offline RL benchmarks. We further demonstrate SARA's versatility in applications such as trajectory filtering for downstream tasks, cross-task preference transfer, and reward shaping in online learning.</p></details> |  |
| **[SR-Reward: Taking The Path More Traveled](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02330v3)** | 2025-06-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we propose a novel method for learning reward functions directly from offline demonstrations. Unlike traditional inverse reinforcement learning (IRL), our approach decouples the reward function from the learner's policy, eliminating the adversarial interaction typically required between the two. This results in a more stable and efficient training process. Our reward function, called \textit{SR-Reward}, leverages successor representation (SR) to encode a state based on expected future states' visitation under the demonstration policy and transition dynamics. By utilizing the Bellman equation, SR-Reward can be learned concurrently with most reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms without altering the existing training pipeline. We also introduce a negative sampling strategy to mitigate overestimation errors by reducing rewards for out-of-distribution data, thereby enhancing robustness. This strategy inherently introduces a conservative bias into RL algorithms that employ the learned reward. We evaluate our method on the D4RL benchmark, achieving competitive results compared to offline RL algorithms with access to true rewards and imitation learning (IL) techniques like behavioral cloning. Moreover, our ablation studies on data size and quality reveal the advantages and limitations of SR-Reward as a proxy for true rewards.</p></details> |  |

Existing studies aim to improve data-policy coverage to mitigate distributional shifts, but overlook security risks from insufficient coverage, and the single-step analysis is not consistent with the multi-step decision-making nature of offline RL. To address this, we introduce the sequence-level concentrability coefficient to quantify coverage, and reveal its exponential amplification on the upper bound of estimation errors through theoretical analysis. Building on this, we propose the Collapsing Sequence-Level Data-Policy Coverage (CSDPC) poisoning attack. Considering the continuous nature of offline RL data, we convert state-action pairs into decision units, and extract representative decision patterns that capture multi-step behavior. We identify rare patterns likely to cause insufficient coverage, and poison them to reduce coverage and exacerbate distributional shifts. Experiments show that poisoning just 1% of the dataset can degrade agent performance by 90%. This finding provides new perspectives for analyzing and safeguarding the security of offline RL.</p></details> |  |
| **[Policy-Based Trajectory Clustering in Offline Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09202v2)** | 2025-06-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce a novel task of clustering trajectories from offline reinforcement learning (RL) datasets, where each cluster center represents the policy that generated its trajectories. By leveraging the connection between the KL-divergence of offline trajectory distributions and a mixture of policy-induced distributions, we formulate a natural clustering objective. To solve this, we propose Policy-Guided K-means (PG-Kmeans) and Centroid-Attracted Autoencoder (CAAE). PG-Kmeans iteratively trains behavior cloning (BC) policies and assigns trajectories based on policy generation probabilities, while CAAE resembles the VQ-VAE framework by guiding the latent representations of trajectories toward the vicinity of specific codebook entries to achieve clustering. Theoretically, we prove the finite-step convergence of PG-Kmeans and identify a key challenge in offline trajectory clustering: the inherent ambiguity of optimal solutions due to policy-induced conflicts, which can result in multiple equally valid but structurally distinct clusterings. Experimentally, we validate our methods on the widely used D4RL dataset and custom GridWorld environments. Our results show that both PG-Kmeans and CAAE effectively partition trajectories into meaningful clusters. They offer a promising framework for policy-based trajectory clustering, with broad applications in offline RL and beyond.</p></details> |  |

DICE-based offline constrained RL particularly benefits from the flexibility of DICE, as it simultaneously maximizes return while estimating costs in offline settings. However, we have observed that recent approaches designed to enhance the offline RL performance of the DICE framework inadvertently undermine its ability to perform OPE, making them unsuitable for constrained RL scenarios. In this paper, we identify the root cause of this limitation: their reliance on a semi-gradient optimization, which solves a fundamentally different optimization problem and results in failures in cost estimation. Building on these insights, we propose a novel method to enable OPE and constrained RL through semi-gradient DICE. Our method ensures accurate cost estimation and achieves state-of-the-art performance on the offline constrained RL benchmark, DSRL.</p></details> | <details><summary>Const...</summary><p>Constrained Offline Reinforcement Learning</p></details> |

Unlike traditional offline reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms, RCSL frames policy learning as a supervised learning problem by taking both the state and return as input. This approach eliminates the instability often associated with temporal difference (TD) learning in offline RL. However, RCSL has been criticized for lacking the stitching property, meaning its performance is inherently limited by the quality of the policy used to generate the offline dataset. To address this limitation, we propose a principled and simple framework called Reinforced RCSL. The key innovation of our framework is the introduction of a concept we call the in-distribution optimal return-to-go. This mechanism leverages our policy to identify the best achievable in-dataset future return based on the current state, avoiding the need for complex return augmentation techniques. Our theoretical analysis demonstrates that Reinforced RCSL can consistently outperform the standard RCSL approach. Empirical results further validate our claims, showing significant performance improvements across a range of benchmarks.</p></details> | <details><summary>25 pa...</summary><p>25 pages, 4 figures, 12 tables</p></details> |

Existing methods address this issue by imposing constraints; however, they often become overly conservative when evaluating OOD regions, which constrains the $Q$-function generalization. This over-constraint issue results in poor $Q$-value estimation and hinders policy improvement. In this paper, we introduce a novel approach to achieve better $Q$-value estimation by enhancing $Q$-function generalization in OOD regions within Convex Hull and its Neighborhood (CHN). Under the safety generalization guarantees of the CHN, we propose the Smooth Bellman Operator (SBO), which updates OOD $Q$-values by smoothing them with neighboring in-sample $Q$-values. We theoretically show that SBO approximates true $Q$-values for both in-sample and OOD actions within the CHN. Our practical algorithm, Smooth Q-function OOD Generalization (SQOG), empirically alleviates the over-constraint issue, achieving near-accurate $Q$-value estimation. On the D4RL benchmarks, SQOG outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in both performance and computational efficiency.</p></details> | ICLR 2025 |

While the consistency model offers a potential solution, its applications to decision-making often struggle with suboptimal demonstrations or rely on complex concurrent training of multiple networks. In this work, we propose a novel approach to consistency distillation for offline reinforcement learning that directly incorporates reward optimization into the distillation process. Our method enables single-step generation while maintaining higher performance and simpler training. Empirical evaluations on the Gym MuJoCo benchmarks and long horizon planning demonstrate that our approach can achieve an 8.7% improvement over previous state-of-the-art while offering up to 142x speedup over diffusion counterparts in inference time.</p></details> |  |

Due to the gap between the learned and actual environment, conservatism should be incorporated into the algorithm to balance accurate offline data and imprecise model data. The conservatism of current algorithms mostly relies on model uncertainty estimation. However, uncertainty estimation is unreliable and leads to poor performance in certain scenarios, and the previous methods ignore differences between the model data, which brings great conservatism. To address the above issues, this paper proposes a milDly cOnservative Model-bAsed offlINe RL algorithm (DOMAIN) without estimating model uncertainty, and designs the adaptive sampling distribution of model samples, which can adaptively adjust the model data penalty. In this paper, we theoretically demonstrate that the Q value learned by the DOMAIN outside the region is a lower bound of the true Q value, the DOMAIN is less conservative than previous model-based offline RL algorithms, and has the guarantee of safety policy improvement. The results of extensive experiments show that DOMAIN outperforms prior RL algorithms and the average performance has improved by 1.8% on the D4RL benchmark.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics: Systems</p></details> |

Existing methods rely on fixed conservative policies, restricting adaptivity and generalization. To address this, we propose Reflect-then-Plan (RefPlan), a novel doubly Bayesian offline model-based (MB) planning approach. RefPlan unifies uncertainty modeling and MB planning by recasting planning as Bayesian posterior estimation. At deployment, it updates a belief over environment dynamics using real-time observations, incorporating uncertainty into MB planning via marginalization. Empirical results on standard benchmarks show that RefPlan significantly improves the performance of conservative offline RL policies. In particular, RefPlan maintains robust performance under high epistemic uncertainty and limited data, while demonstrating resilience to changing environment dynamics, improving the flexibility, generalizability, and robustness of offline-learned policies.</p></details> |  |

However, they face challenges handling distribution shifts due to the lack of online interaction during training. To this end, we propose a novel method named State Reconstruction for Diffusion Policies (SRDP) that incorporates state reconstruction feature learning in the recent class of diffusion policies to address the problem of out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization. Our method promotes learning of generalizable state representation to alleviate the distribution shift caused by OOD states. To illustrate the OOD generalization and faster convergence of SRDP, we design a novel 2D Multimodal Contextual Bandit environment and realize it on a 6-DoF real-world UR10 robot, as well as in simulation, and compare its performance with prior algorithms. In particular, we show the importance of the proposed state reconstruction via ablation studies. In addition, we assess the performance of our model on standard continuous control benchmarks (D4RL), namely the navigation of an 8-DoF ant and forward locomotion of half-cheetah, hopper, and walker2d, achieving state-of-the-art results. Finally, we demonstrate that our method can achieve 167% improvement over the competing baseline on a sparse continuous control navigation task where various regions of the state space are removed from the offline RL dataset, including the region encapsulating the goal.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in IEEE RA-L with IROS presentation option (2024 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems), 8 pages, 7 figures</p></details> |
| **[Reinforcement Learning for Individual Optimal Policy from Heterogeneous Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09496v2)** | 2025-06-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Offline reinforcement learning (RL) aims to find optimal policies in dynamic environments in order to maximize the expected total rewards by leveraging pre-collected data. Learning from heterogeneous data is one of the fundamental challenges in offline RL. Traditional methods focus on learning an optimal policy for all individuals with pre-collected data from a single episode or homogeneous batch episodes, and thus, may result in a suboptimal policy for a heterogeneous population. In this paper, we propose an individualized offline policy optimization framework for heterogeneous time-stationary Markov decision processes (MDPs). The proposed heterogeneous model with individual latent variables enables us to efficiently estimate the individual Q-functions, and our Penalized Pessimistic Personalized Policy Learning (P4L) algorithm guarantees a fast rate on the average regret under a weak partial coverage assumption on behavior policies. In addition, our simulation studies and a real data application demonstrate the superior numerical performance of the proposed method compared with existing methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[ADG: Ambient Diffusion-Guided Dataset Recovery for Corruption-Robust Offline Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23871v2)** | 2025-06-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Real-world datasets collected from sensors or human inputs are prone to noise and errors, posing significant challenges for applying offline reinforcement learning (RL). While existing methods have made progress in addressing corrupted actions and rewards, they remain insufficient for handling corruption in high-dimensional state spaces and for cases where multiple elements in the dataset are corrupted simultaneously. Diffusion models, known for their strong denoising capabilities, offer a promising direction for this problem-but their tendency to overfit noisy samples limits their direct applicability. To overcome this, we propose Ambient Diffusion-Guided Dataset Recovery (ADG), a novel approach that pioneers the use of diffusion models to tackle data corruption in offline RL. First, we introduce Ambient Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPM) from approximated distributions, which enable learning on partially corrupted datasets with theoretical guarantees. Second, we use the noise-prediction property of Ambient DDPM to distinguish between clean and corrupted data, and then use the clean subset to train a standard DDPM. Third, we employ the trained standard DDPM to refine the previously identified corrupted data, enhancing data quality for subsequent offline RL training. A notable strength of ADG is its versatility-it can be seamlessly integrated with any offline RL algorithm. Experiments on a range of benchmarks, including MuJoCo, Kitchen, and Adroit, demonstrate that ADG effectively mitigates the impact of corrupted data and improves the robustness of offline RL under various noise settings, achieving state-of-the-art results.</p></details> |  |
| **[Reachability Weighted Offline Goal-conditioned Resampling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02577v1)** | 2025-06-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Offline goal-conditioned reinforcement learning (RL) relies on fixed datasets where many potential goals share the same state and action spaces. However, these potential goals are not explicitly represented in the collected trajectories. To learn a generalizable goal-conditioned policy, it is common to sample goals and state-action pairs uniformly using dynamic programming methods such as Q-learning. Uniform sampling, however, requires an intractably large dataset to cover all possible combinations and creates many unreachable state-goal-action pairs that degrade policy performance. Our key insight is that sampling should favor transitions that enable goal achievement. To this end, we propose Reachability Weighted Sampling (RWS). RWS uses a reachability classifier trained via positive-unlabeled (PU) learning on goal-conditioned state-action values. The classifier maps these values to a reachability score, which is then used as a sampling priority. RWS is a plug-and-play module that integrates seamlessly with standard offline RL algorithms. Experiments on six complex simulated robotic manipulation tasks, including those with a robot arm and a dexterous hand, show that RWS significantly improves performance. In one notable case, performance on the HandBlock-Z task improved by nearly 50 percent relative to the baseline. These results indicate the effectiveness of reachability-weighted sampling.</p></details> |  |
| **[Universal Value-Function Uncertainties](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21119v2)** | 2025-06-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Estimating epistemic uncertainty in value functions is a crucial challenge for many aspects of reinforcement learning (RL), including efficient exploration, safe decision-making, and offline RL. While deep ensembles provide a robust method for quantifying value uncertainty, they come with significant computational overhead. Single-model methods, while computationally favorable, often rely on heuristics and typically require additional propagation mechanisms for myopic uncertainty estimates. In this work we introduce universal value-function uncertainties (UVU), which, similar in spirit to random network distillation (RND), quantify uncertainty as squared prediction errors between an online learner and a fixed, randomly initialized target network. Unlike RND, UVU errors reflect policy-conditional value uncertainty, incorporating the future uncertainties any given policy may encounter. This is due to the training procedure employed in UVU: the online network is trained using temporal difference learning with a synthetic reward derived from the fixed, randomly initialized target network. We provide an extensive theoretical analysis of our approach using neural tangent kernel (NTK) theory and show that in the limit of infinite network width, UVU errors are exactly equivalent to the variance of an ensemble of independent universal value functions. Empirically, we show that UVU achieves equal performance to large ensembles on challenging multi-task offline RL settings, while offering simplicity and substantial computational savings.</p></details> |  |
| **[Generalized Linear Markov Decision Process](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00818v1)** | 2025-06-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The linear Markov Decision Process (MDP) framework offers a principled foundation for reinforcement learning (RL) with strong theoretical guarantees and sample efficiency. However, its restrictive assumption-that both transition dynamics and reward functions are linear in the same feature space-limits its applicability in real-world domains, where rewards often exhibit nonlinear or discrete structures. Motivated by applications such as healthcare and e-commerce, where data is scarce and reward signals can be binary or count-valued, we propose the Generalized Linear MDP (GLMDP) framework-an extension of the linear MDP framework-that models rewards using generalized linear models (GLMs) while maintaining linear transition dynamics. We establish the Bellman completeness of GLMDPs with respect to a new function class that accommodates nonlinear rewards and develop two offline RL algorithms: Generalized Pessimistic Value Iteration (GPEVI) and a semi-supervised variant (SS-GPEVI) that utilizes both labeled and unlabeled trajectories. Our algorithms achieve theoretical guarantees on policy suboptimality and demonstrate improved sample efficiency in settings where reward labels are expensive or limited.</p></details> | 34 pages, 9 figures |
| **[Adapting Offline Reinforcement Learning with Online Delays](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00131v1)** | 2025-05-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Offline-to-online deployment of reinforcement-learning (RL) agents must bridge two gaps: (1) the sim-to-real gap, where real systems add latency and other imperfections not present in simulation, and (2) the interaction gap, where policies trained purely offline face out-of-distribution states during online execution because gathering new interaction data is costly or risky. Agents therefore have to generalize from static, delay-free datasets to dynamic, delay-prone environments. Standard offline RL learns from delay-free logs yet must act under delays that break the Markov assumption and hurt performance. We introduce DT-CORL (Delay-Transformer belief policy Constrained Offline RL), an offline-RL framework built to cope with delayed dynamics at deployment. DT-CORL (i) produces delay-robust actions with a transformer-based belief predictor even though it never sees delayed observations during training, and (ii) is markedly more sample-efficient than naïve history-augmentation baselines. Experiments on D4RL benchmarks with several delay settings show that DT-CORL consistently outperforms both history-augmentation and vanilla belief-based methods, narrowing the sim-to-real latency gap while preserving data efficiency.</p></details> |  |
| **[SOReL and TOReL: Two Methods for Fully Offline Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22442v2)** | 2025-05-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Sample efficiency remains a major obstacle for real world adoption of reinforcement learning (RL): success has been limited to settings where simulators provide access to essentially unlimited environment interactions, which in reality are typically costly or dangerous to obtain. Offline RL in principle offers a solution by exploiting offline data to learn a near-optimal policy before deployment. In practice, however, current offline RL methods rely on extensive online interactions for hyperparameter tuning, and have no reliable bound on their initial online performance. To address these two issues, we introduce two algorithms. Firstly, SOReL: an algorithm for safe offline reinforcement learning. Using only offline data, our Bayesian approach infers a posterior over environment dynamics to obtain a reliable estimate of the online performance via the posterior predictive uncertainty. Crucially, all hyperparameters are also tuned fully offline. Secondly, we introduce TOReL: a tuning for offline reinforcement learning algorithm that extends our information rate based offline hyperparameter tuning methods to general offline RL approaches. Our empirical evaluation confirms SOReL's ability to accurately estimate regret in the Bayesian setting whilst TOReL's offline hyperparameter tuning achieves competitive performance with the best online hyperparameter tuning methods using only offline data. Thus, SOReL and TOReL make a significant step towards safe and reliable offline RL, unlocking the potential for RL in the real world. Our implementations are publicly available: https://github.com/CWibault/sorel\_torel.</p></details> |  |

However, scaling such systems has proven notoriously tricky. In contrast, techniques from generative modeling have proven remarkably scalable and are simple to train. In this work, we combine these strengths, by deriving a direct relation between policy improvement and guidance of diffusion models. The resulting framework, CFGRL, is trained with the simplicity of supervised learning, yet can further improve on the policies in the data. On offline RL tasks, we observe a reliable trend -- increased guidance weighting leads to increased performance. Of particular importance, CFGRL can operate without explicitly learning a value function, allowing us to generalize simple supervised methods (e.g., goal-conditioned behavioral cloning) to further prioritize optimality, gaining performance for "free" across the board.</p></details> |  |

However, applying these models to offline reinforcement learning (RL) remains challenging due to the iterative nature of their noise sampling processes, making policy optimization difficult. In this paper, we introduce Scalable Offline Reinforcement Learning (SORL), a new offline RL algorithm that leverages shortcut models - a novel class of generative models - to scale both training and inference. SORL's policy can capture complex data distributions and can be trained simply and efficiently in a one-stage training procedure. At test time, SORL introduces both sequential and parallel inference scaling by using the learned Q-function as a verifier. We demonstrate that SORL achieves strong performance across a range of offline RL tasks and exhibits positive scaling behavior with increased test-time compute.

The challenge arises when labeled datasets are expensive, especially when rewards have to be provided by human labelers for large datasets. In contrast, unlabelled data tends to be less expensive. This situation highlights the importance of finding effective ways to use unlabelled data in offline RL, especially when labelled data is limited or expensive to obtain. In this paper, we present the algorithm to utilize the unlabeled data in the offline RL method with kernel function approximation and give the theoretical guarantee. We present various eigenvalue decay conditions of $\mathcal{H}_k$ which determine the complexity of the algorithm. In summary, our work provides a promising approach for exploiting the advantages offered by unlabeled data in offline RL, whilst maintaining theoretical assurances.</p></details> |  |
| **[Constraint-Adaptive Policy Switching for Offline Safe Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18946v2)** | 2025-05-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Offline safe reinforcement learning (OSRL) involves learning a decision-making policy to maximize rewards from a fixed batch of training data to satisfy pre-defined safety constraints. However, adapting to varying safety constraints during deployment without retraining remains an under-explored challenge. To address this challenge, we introduce constraint-adaptive policy switching (CAPS), a wrapper framework around existing offline RL algorithms. During training, CAPS uses offline data to learn multiple policies with a shared representation that optimize different reward and cost trade-offs. During testing, CAPS switches between those policies by selecting at each state the policy that maximizes future rewards among those that satisfy the current cost constraint. Our experiments on 38 tasks from the DSRL benchmark demonstrate that CAPS consistently outperforms existing methods, establishing a strong wrapper-based baseline for OSRL. The code is publicly available at https://github.com/yassineCh/CAPS.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in Proceedings of the AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence, 2025</p></details> |
| **[GenPO: Generative Diffusion Models Meet On-Policy Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18763v2)** | 2025-05-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in reinforcement learning (RL) have demonstrated the powerful exploration capabilities and multimodality of generative diffusion-based policies. While substantial progress has been made in offline RL and off-policy RL settings, integrating diffusion policies into on-policy frameworks like PPO remains underexplored. This gap is particularly significant given the widespread use of large-scale parallel GPU-accelerated simulators, such as IsaacLab, which are optimized for on-policy RL algorithms and enable rapid training of complex robotic tasks. A key challenge lies in computing state-action log-likelihoods under diffusion policies, which is straightforward for Gaussian policies but intractable for flow-based models due to irreversible forward-reverse processes and discretization errors (e.g., Euler-Maruyama approximations). To bridge this gap, we propose GenPO, a generative policy optimization framework that leverages exact diffusion inversion to construct invertible action mappings. GenPO introduces a novel doubled dummy action mechanism that enables invertibility via alternating updates, resolving log-likelihood computation barriers. Furthermore, we also use the action log-likelihood for unbiased entropy and KL divergence estimation, enabling KL-adaptive learning rates and entropy regularization in on-policy updates. Extensive experiments on eight IsaacLab benchmarks, including legged locomotion (Ant, Humanoid, Anymal-D, Unitree H1, Go2), dexterous manipulation (Shadow Hand), aerial control (Quadcopter), and robotic arm tasks (Franka), demonstrate GenPO's superiority over existing RL baselines. Notably, GenPO is the first method to successfully integrate diffusion policies into on-policy RL, unlocking their potential for large-scale parallelized training and real-world robotic deployment.</p></details> |  |

To mitigate the risks posed by RL poisoning, we extend certified defenses to provide larger guarantees against adversarial manipulation, ensuring robustness for both per-state actions, and the overall expected cumulative reward. Our approach leverages properties of Differential Privacy, in a manner that allows this work to span both continuous and discrete spaces, as well as stochastic and deterministic environments -- significantly expanding the scope and applicability of achievable guarantees. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that our approach ensures the performance drops to no more than $50\%$ with up to $7\%$ of the training data poisoned, significantly improving over the $0.008\%$ in prior work~\citep{wu_copa_2022}, while producing certified radii that is $5$ times larger as well. This highlights the potential of our framework to enhance safety and reliability in offline RL.</p></details> |  |

To alleviate extrapolation errors, existing studies often uniformly regularize the value function or policy updates across all states. However, due to substantial variations in data quality, the fixed regularization strength often leads to a dilemma: Weak regularization strength fails to address extrapolation errors and value overestimation, while strong regularization strength shifts policy learning toward behavior cloning, impeding potential performance enabled by Bellman updates. To address this issue, we propose the selective state-adaptive regularization method for offline RL. Specifically, we introduce state-adaptive regularization coefficients to trust state-level Bellman-driven results, while selectively applying regularization on high-quality actions, aiming to avoid performance degradation caused by tight constraints on low-quality actions. By establishing a connection between the representative value regularization method, CQL, and explicit policy constraint methods, we effectively extend selective state-adaptive regularization to these two mainstream offline RL approaches. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed method significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches in both offline and offline-to-online settings on the D4RL benchmark.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ICML 2025</p></details> |

By applying powerful generative models such as flow-based models to reinforcement learning, we can effectively model complex multi-modal action distributions and achieve superior robotic control in continuous action spaces, surpassing the limitations of single-modal action distributions with traditional Gaussian-based policies. Previous methods usually adopt the generative models as behavior models to fit state-conditioned action distributions from datasets, with policy optimization conducted separately through additional policies using value-based sample weighting or gradient-based updates. However, this separation prevents the simultaneous optimization of multi-modal distribution fitting and policy improvement, ultimately hindering the training of models and degrading the performance. To address this issue, we propose Decision Flow, a unified framework that integrates multi-modal action distribution modeling and policy optimization. Specifically, our method formulates the action generation procedure of flow-based models as a flow decision-making process, where each action generation step corresponds to one flow decision. Consequently, our method seamlessly optimizes the flow policy while capturing multi-modal action distributions. We provide rigorous proofs of Decision Flow and validate the effectiveness through extensive experiments across dozens of offline RL environments. Compared with established offline RL baselines, the results demonstrate that our method achieves or matches the SOTA performance.</p></details> |  |

Training a flow policy with RL is a tricky problem, due to the iterative nature of the action generation process. We address this challenge by training an expressive one-step policy with RL, rather than directly guiding an iterative flow policy to maximize values. This way, we can completely avoid unstable recursive backpropagation, eliminate costly iterative action generation at test time, yet still mostly maintain expressivity. We experimentally show that FQL leads to strong performance across 73 challenging state- and pixel-based OGBench and D4RL tasks in offline RL and offline-to-online RL.

While many open-source libraries offer robust implementations of offline RL algorithms, they all rely on datasets composed of experience tuples consisting of state, action, next state, and reward. Managing, curating, and distributing such datasets requires suitable infrastructure. Although static datasets exist for established benchmark problems, no standardized or scalable solution supports developing and sharing datasets for novel or user-defined benchmarks. To address this gap, we introduce PyTupli, a Python-based tool to streamline the creation, storage, and dissemination of benchmark environments and their corresponding tuple datasets. PyTupli includes a lightweight client library with defined interfaces for uploading and retrieving benchmarks and data. It supports fine-grained filtering at both the episode and tuple level, allowing researchers to curate high-quality, task-specific datasets. A containerized server component enables production-ready deployment with authentication, access control, and automated certificate provisioning for secure use. By addressing key barriers in dataset infrastructure, PyTupli facilitates more collaborative, reproducible, and scalable offline RL research.</p></details> |  |
| **[Efficient Online RL Fine Tuning with Offline Pre-trained Policy Only](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16856v1)** | 2025-05-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Improving the performance of pre-trained policies through online reinforcement learning (RL) is a critical yet challenging topic. Existing online RL fine-tuning methods require continued training with offline pretrained Q-functions for stability and performance. However, these offline pretrained Q-functions commonly underestimate state-action pairs beyond the offline dataset due to the conservatism in most offline RL methods, which hinders further exploration when transitioning from the offline to the online setting. Additionally, this requirement limits their applicability in scenarios where only pre-trained policies are available but pre-trained Q-functions are absent, such as in imitation learning (IL) pre-training. To address these challenges, we propose a method for efficient online RL fine-tuning using solely the offline pre-trained policy, eliminating reliance on pre-trained Q-functions. We introduce PORL (Policy-Only Reinforcement Learning Fine-Tuning), which rapidly initializes the Q-function from scratch during the online phase to avoid detrimental pessimism. Our method not only achieves competitive performance with advanced offline-to-online RL algorithms and online RL approaches that leverage data or policies prior, but also pioneers a new path for directly fine-tuning behavior cloning (BC) policies.</p></details> |  |
| **[Offline Guarded Safe Reinforcement Learning for Medical Treatment Optimization Strategies](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16242v1)** | 2025-05-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>When applying offline reinforcement learning (RL) in healthcare scenarios, the out-of-distribution (OOD) issues pose significant risks, as inappropriate generalization beyond clinical expertise can result in potentially harmful recommendations. While existing methods like conservative Q-learning (CQL) attempt to address the OOD issue, their effectiveness is limited by only constraining action selection by suppressing uncertain actions. This action-only regularization imitates clinician actions that prioritize short-term rewards, but it fails to regulate downstream state trajectories, thereby limiting the discovery of improved long-term treatment strategies. To safely improve policy beyond clinician recommendations while ensuring that state-action trajectories remain in-distribution, we propose \textit{Offline Guarded Safe Reinforcement Learning} ($\mathsf{OGSRL}$), a theoretically grounded model-based offline RL framework. $\mathsf{OGSRL}$ introduces a novel dual constraint mechanism for improving policy with reliability and safety. First, the OOD guardian is established to specify clinically validated regions for safe policy exploration. By constraining optimization within these regions, it enables the reliable exploration of treatment strategies that outperform clinician behavior by leveraging the full patient state history, without drifting into unsupported state-action trajectories. Second, we introduce a safety cost constraint that encodes medical knowledge about physiological safety boundaries, providing domain-specific safeguards even in areas where training data might contain potentially unsafe interventions. Notably, we provide theoretical guarantees on safety and near-optimality: policies that satisfy these constraints remain in safe and reliable regions and achieve performance close to the best possible policy supported by the data.</p></details> |  |

However, the majority of existing approaches emphasize only short-term safety, neglecting long-horizon considerations. Consequently, they may violate safety constraints and fail to ensure sustained protection during online deployment. Moreover, the learned policies often struggle to handle states and actions that are not present or out-of-distribution(OOD) from the offline dataset, and exhibit limited sample efficiency. To address these challenges, we propose a novel framework Feasibility-Aware offline Safe Reinforcement Learning with CVAE-based Pessimism (FASP). First, we employ Hamilton-Jacobi (H-J) reachability analysis to generate reliable safety labels, which serve as supervisory signals for training both a conditional variational autoencoder (CVAE) and a safety classifier. This approach not only ensures high sampling efficiency but also provides rigorous long-horizon safety guarantees. Furthermore, we utilize pessimistic estimation methods to estimate the Q-value of reward and cost, which mitigates the extrapolation errors induces by OOD actions, and penalize unsafe actions to enabled the agent to proactively avoid high-risk behaviors. Moreover, we theoretically prove the validity of this pessimistic estimation. Extensive experiments on DSRL benchmarks demonstrate that FASP algorithm achieves competitive performance across multiple experimental tasks, particularly outperforming state-of-the-art algorithms in terms of safety.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin comment: This version removed due to inaccurate authorship</p></details> |

Although generative LLMs have made substantial progress in various tasks, their performance as LLM-Judge still falls short of expectations. In this work, we propose Think-J, which improves generative LLM-as-a-Judge by learning how to think. We first utilized a small amount of curated data to develop the model with initial judgment thinking capabilities. Subsequently, we optimize the judgment thinking traces based on reinforcement learning (RL). We propose two methods for judgment thinking optimization, based on offline and online RL, respectively. The offline RL requires training a critic model to construct positive and negative examples for learning. The online method defines rule-based reward as feedback for optimization. Experimental results showed that our approach can significantly enhance the evaluation capability of generative LLM-Judge, surpassing both generative and classifier-based LLM-Judge without requiring extra human annotations.</p></details> | 16 pages, 14 figures |

However, existing methods rely on joint training of the guidance module and the diffusion model, which can be suboptimal during the early stages when the guidance is inaccurate and provides noisy learning signals. In offline RL, guidance depends solely on offline data: observations, actions, and rewards, and is independent of the policy module's behavior, suggesting that joint training is not required. This paper proposes modular training methods that decouple the guidance module from the diffusion model, based on three key findings: Guidance Necessity: We explore how the effectiveness of guidance varies with the training stage and algorithm choice, uncovering the roles of guidance and diffusion. A lack of good guidance in the early stage presents an opportunity for optimization. Guidance-First Diffusion Training: We introduce a method where the guidance module is first trained independently as a value estimator, then frozen to guide the diffusion model using classifier-free reward guidance. This modularization reduces memory usage, improves computational efficiency, and enhances both sample efficiency and final performance. Cross-Module Transferability: Applying two independently trained guidance models, one during training and the other during inference, can significantly reduce normalized score variance (e.g., reducing IQR by 86%). We show that guidance modules trained with one algorithm (e.g., IDQL) can be directly reused with another (e.g., DQL), with no additional training required, demonstrating baseline-level performance as well as strong modularity and transferability. We provide theoretical justification and empirical validation on bullet D4RL benchmarks. Our findings suggest a new paradigm for offline RL: modular, reusable, and composable training pipelines.</p></details> |  |

In this study, we explore the integration of RL objectives within an offline ICRL framework. Through experiments on more than 150 GridWorld and MuJoCo environment-derived datasets, we demonstrate that optimizing RL objectives directly improves performance by approximately 30% on average compared to widely adopted Algorithm Distillation (AD), across various dataset coverages, structures, expertise levels, and environmental complexities. Furthermore, in the challenging XLand-MiniGrid environment, RL objectives doubled the performance of AD. Our results also reveal that the addition of conservatism during value learning brings additional improvements in almost all settings tested. Our findings emphasize the importance of aligning ICRL learning objectives with the RL reward-maximization goal, and demonstrate that offline RL is a promising direction for advancing ICRL.</p></details> |  |
| **[Your Offline Policy is Not Trustworthy: Bilevel Reinforcement Learning for Sequential Portfolio Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12759v1)** | 2025-05-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement learning (RL) has shown significant promise for sequential portfolio optimization tasks, such as stock trading, where the objective is to maximize cumulative returns while minimizing risks using historical data. However, traditional RL approaches often produce policies that merely memorize the optimal yet impractical buying and selling behaviors within the fixed dataset. These offline policies are less generalizable as they fail to account for the non-stationary nature of the market. Our approach, MetaTrader, frames portfolio optimization as a new type of partial-offline RL problem and makes two technical contributions. First, MetaTrader employs a bilevel learning framework that explicitly trains the RL agent to improve both in-domain profits on the original dataset and out-of-domain performance across diverse transformations of the raw financial data. Second, our approach incorporates a new temporal difference (TD) method that approximates worst-case TD estimates from a batch of transformed TD targets, addressing the value overestimation issue that is particularly challenging in scenarios with limited offline data. Our empirical results on two public stock datasets show that MetaTrader outperforms existing methods, including both RL-based approaches and traditional stock prediction models.</p></details> |  |

Existing methods either exhaustively evaluate the action space, making them computationally infeasible, or factorize Q-values, failing to represent joint sub-action effects. We propose Branch Value Estimation (BraVE), a value-based method that uses tree-structured action traversal to evaluate a linear number of joint actions while preserving dependency structure. BraVE outperforms prior offline RL methods by up to $20\times$ in environments with over four million actions.</p></details> |  |

However, it struggles with suboptimal offline behaviors and inaccurate value estimation due to the lack of environmental interaction. We present Video-Enhanced Offline RL (VeoRL), a model-based method that constructs an interactive world model from diverse, unlabeled video data readily available online. Leveraging model-based behavior guidance, our approach transfers commonsense knowledge of control policy and physical dynamics from natural videos to the RL agent within the target domain. VeoRL achieves substantial performance gains (over 100% in some cases) across visual control tasks in robotic manipulation, autonomous driving, and open-world video games.</p></details> |  |
| **[ImagineBench: Evaluating Reinforcement Learning with Large Language Model Rollouts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10010v1)** | 2025-05-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A central challenge in reinforcement learning (RL) is its dependence on extensive real-world interaction data to learn task-specific policies. While recent work demonstrates that large language models (LLMs) can mitigate this limitation by generating synthetic experience (noted as imaginary rollouts) for mastering novel tasks, progress in this emerging field is hindered due to the lack of a standard benchmark. To bridge this gap, we introduce ImagineBench, the first comprehensive benchmark for evaluating offline RL algorithms that leverage both real rollouts and LLM-imaginary rollouts. The key features of ImagineBench include: (1) datasets comprising environment-collected and LLM-imaginary rollouts; (2) diverse domains of environments covering locomotion, robotic manipulation, and navigation tasks; and (3) natural language task instructions with varying complexity levels to facilitate language-conditioned policy learning. Through systematic evaluation of state-of-the-art offline RL algorithms, we observe that simply applying existing offline RL algorithms leads to suboptimal performance on unseen tasks, achieving 35.44% success rate in hard tasks in contrast to 64.37% of method training on real rollouts for hard tasks. This result highlights the need for algorithm advancements to better leverage LLM-imaginary rollouts. Additionally, we identify key opportunities for future research: including better utilization of imaginary rollouts, fast online adaptation and continual learning, and extension to multi-modal tasks. Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/LAMDA-RL/ImagineBench.</p></details> |  |
| **[What Matters for Batch Online Reinforcement Learning in Robotics?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08078v1)** | 2025-05-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The ability to learn from large batches of autonomously collected data for policy improvement -- a paradigm we refer to as batch online reinforcement learning -- holds the promise of enabling truly scalable robot learning by significantly reducing the need for human effort of data collection while getting benefits from self-improvement. Yet, despite the promise of this paradigm, it remains challenging to achieve due to algorithms not being able to learn effectively from the autonomous data. For example, prior works have applied imitation learning and filtered imitation learning methods to the batch online RL problem, but these algorithms often fail to efficiently improve from the autonomously collected data or converge quickly to a suboptimal point. This raises the question of what matters for effective batch online RL in robotics. Motivated by this question, we perform a systematic empirical study of three axes -- (i) algorithm class, (ii) policy extraction methods, and (iii) policy expressivity -- and analyze how these axes affect performance and scaling with the amount of autonomous data. Through our analysis, we make several observations. First, we observe that the use of Q-functions to guide batch online RL significantly improves performance over imitation-based methods. Building on this, we show that an implicit method of policy extraction -- via choosing the best action in the distribution of the policy -- is necessary over traditional policy extraction methods from offline RL. Next, we show that an expressive policy class is preferred over less expressive policy classes. Based on this analysis, we propose a general recipe for effective batch online RL. We then show a simple addition to the recipe of using temporally-correlated noise to obtain more diversity results in further performance gains. Our recipe obtains significantly better performance and scaling compared to prior methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[The Pump Scheduling Problem: A Real-World Scenario for Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.11111v2)** | 2025-05-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) has demonstrated impressive results in domains such as games and robotics, where task formulations are well-defined. However, few DRL benchmarks are grounded in complex, real-world environments, where safety constraints, partial observability, and the need for hand-engineered task representations pose significant challenges. To help bridge this gap, we introduce a testbed based on the pump scheduling problem in a real-world water distribution facility. The task involves controlling pumps to ensure a reliable water supply while minimizing energy consumption and respecting the constraints of the system. Our testbed includes a realistic simulator, three years of high-resolution (1-minute) operational data from human-led control, and a baseline RL task formulation. This testbed supports a wide range of research directions, including offline RL, safe exploration, inverse RL, and multi-objective optimization.</p></details> |  |

We present a principled cache-efficient framework for posterior sampling with LLM-derived priors that dramatically reduces these costs while maintaining high performance. At the core of our approach is an adaptive caching mechanism, where cache parameters are meta-optimized using surrogate gradients derived from policy performance. This design enables efficient inference across both discrete text environments (e.g., TextWorld, ALFWorld) and continuous control domains (e.g., MuJoCo), achieving a 3.8--4.7$\times$ reduction in LLM queries and 4.0--12.0$\times$ lower median latencies (85--93\,ms on a consumer GPU) while retaining 96--98\% of uncached performance. Our theoretical analysis provides KL divergence bounds on approximation quality, validated empirically. The framework extends to offline RL, where our CQL-Prior variant improves performance by 14--29\% and reduces training time by 38--40\%. Extensive evaluations across a diverse suite of eight tasks demonstrate the generalizability and practical viability of LLM-guided RL in resource-constrained settings.</p></details> |  |
| **[ROLeR: Effective Reward Shaping in Offline Reinforcement Learning for Recommender Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13163v2)** | 2025-05-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Offline reinforcement learning (RL) is an effective tool for real-world recommender systems with its capacity to model the dynamic interest of users and its interactive nature. Most existing offline RL recommender systems focus on model-based RL through learning a world model from offline data and building the recommendation policy by interacting with this model. Although these methods have made progress in the recommendation performance, the effectiveness of model-based offline RL methods is often constrained by the accuracy of the estimation of the reward model and the model uncertainties, primarily due to the extreme discrepancy between offline logged data and real-world data in user interactions with online platforms. To fill this gap, a more accurate reward model and uncertainty estimation are needed for the model-based RL methods. In this paper, a novel model-based Reward Shaping in Offline Reinforcement Learning for Recommender Systems, ROLeR, is proposed for reward and uncertainty estimation in recommendation systems. Specifically, a non-parametric reward shaping method is designed to refine the reward model. In addition, a flexible and more representative uncertainty penalty is designed to fit the needs of recommendation systems. Extensive experiments conducted on four benchmark datasets showcase that ROLeR achieves state-of-the-art performance compared with existing baselines.

In contrast, simpler and more economical Offline RL methods remain underexplored. To address this gap, we investigate the effectiveness of Offline RL methods, specifically Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) and its length-desensitized variant LD-DPO, in enhancing the reasoning capabilities of LLMs. Extensive experiments across multiple reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that these simpler Offline RL methods substantially improve model performance, achieving an average enhancement of 3.3\%, with a particularly notable increase of 10.1\% on the challenging Arena-Hard benchmark. Furthermore, we analyze DPO's sensitivity to output length, emphasizing that increasing reasoning length should align with semantic richness, as indiscriminate lengthening may adversely affect model performance. We provide comprehensive descriptions of our data processing and training methodologies, offering empirical evidence and practical insights for developing more cost-effective Offline RL approaches.</p></details> |  |
| **[Analytic Energy-Guided Policy Optimization for Offline Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01822v1)** | 2025-05-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Conditional decision generation with diffusion models has shown powerful competitiveness in reinforcement learning (RL). Recent studies reveal the relation between energy-function-guidance diffusion models and constrained RL problems. The main challenge lies in estimating the intermediate energy, which is intractable due to the log-expectation formulation during the generation process. To address this issue, we propose the Analytic Energy-guided Policy Optimization (AEPO). Specifically, we first provide a theoretical analysis and the closed-form solution of the intermediate guidance when the diffusion model obeys the conditional Gaussian transformation. Then, we analyze the posterior Gaussian distribution in the log-expectation formulation and obtain the target estimation of the log-expectation under mild assumptions. Finally, we train an intermediate energy neural network to approach the target estimation of log-expectation formulation. We apply our method in 30+ offline RL tasks to demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. Extensive experiments illustrate that our method surpasses numerous representative baselines in D4RL offline reinforcement learning benchmarks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Task-Agnostic Learning to Accomplish New Tasks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.04100v3)** | 2025-04-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement Learning (RL) and Imitation Learning (IL) have made great progress in robotic decision-making in recent years. However, these methods show obvious deterioration for new tasks that need to be completed through new combinations of actions. RL methods suffer from reward functions and distribution shifts, while IL methods are limited by expert demonstrations which do not cover new tasks. In contrast, humans can easily complete these tasks with the fragmented knowledge learned from task-agnostic experience. Inspired by this observation, this paper proposes a task-agnostic learning method (TAL for short) that can learn fragmented knowledge only from task-agnostic data to accomplish new tasks. TAL consists of four stages. First, the task-agnostic exploration is performed to collect data from interactions with the environment. The collected data is organized via a knowledge graph. Second, an action feature extractor is proposed and trained using the collected knowledge graph data for task-agnostic fragmented knowledge learning. Third, a candidate action generator is designed, which applies the action feature extractor on a new task to generate multiple candidate action sets. Finally, an action proposal network is designed to produce the probabilities for actions in a new task according to the environmental information. The probabilities are then used to generate order information for selecting actions to be executed from multiple candidate action sets to form the plan. Experiments on a virtual indoor scene show that the proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art offline RL methods and IL methods by more than 20%.</p></details> | <details><summary>14 pa...</summary><p>14 pages, 10 figures, Accepted by IEEE-TCDS</p></details> |

Assuming the optimality of human demonstrations is core to existing VLA policies. However, we claim that in highly dexterous and precise manipulation tasks, human demonstrations are noisy and suboptimal. GR-RL proposes a multi-stage training pipeline that filters, augments, and reinforces the demonstrations by reinforcement learning. First, GR-RL learns a vision-language-conditioned task progress, filters the demonstration trajectories, and only keeps the transitions that contribute positively to the progress. Specifically, we show that by directly applying offline RL with sparse reward, the resulting $Q$-values can be treated as a robust progress function. Next, we introduce morphological symmetry augmentation that greatly improves the generalization and performance of GR-RL. Lastly, to better align the VLA policy with its deployment behaviors for high-precision control, we perform online RL by learning a latent space noise predictor. With this pipeline, GR-RL is, to our knowledge, the first learning-based policy that can autonomously lace up a shoe by threading shoelaces through multiple eyelets with an 83.3% success rate, a task requiring long-horizon reasoning, millimeter-level precision, and compliant soft-body interaction. We hope GR-RL provides a step toward enabling generalist robot foundation models to specialize into reliable real-world experts.</p></details> |  |

To reduce repetitive data collection, we present Real2Edit2Real, a framework that generates new demonstrations by bridging 3D editability with 2D visual data through a 3D control interface. Our approach first reconstructs scene geometry from multi-view RGB observations with a metric-scale 3D reconstruction model. Based on the reconstructed geometry, we perform depth-reliable 3D editing on point clouds to generate new manipulation trajectories while geometrically correcting the robot poses to recover physically consistent depth, which serves as a reliable condition for synthesizing new demonstrations. Finally, we propose a multi-conditional video generation model guided by depth as the primary control signal, together with action, edge, and ray maps, to synthesize spatially augmented multi-view manipulation videos. Experiments on four real-world manipulation tasks demonstrate that policies trained on data generated from only 1-5 source demonstrations can match or outperform those trained on 50 real-world demonstrations, improving data efficiency by up to 10-50x. Moreover, experimental results on height and texture editing demonstrate the framework's flexibility and extensibility, indicating its potential to serve as a unified data generation framework.</p></details> |  |

However, reliance on expensive real-world data limits progress. Simulators offer cost-effective alternatives, but the gap between simulation and reality challenges effective policy transfer. This paper introduces TwinAligner, a novel Real2Sim2Real system that addresses both visual and dynamic gaps. The visual alignment module achieves pixel-level alignment through SDF reconstruction and editable 3DGS rendering, while the dynamic alignment module ensures dynamic consistency by identifying rigid physics from robot-object interaction. TwinAligner improves robot learning by providing scalable data collection and establishing a trustworthy iterative cycle, accelerating algorithm development. Quantitative evaluations highlight TwinAligner's strong capabilities in visual and dynamic real-to-sim alignment. This system enables policies trained in simulation to achieve strong zero-shot generalization to the real world. The high consistency between real-world and simulated policy performance underscores TwinAligner's potential to advance scalable robot learning.

This design allows training the planner on action-free or even non-robot data sources (e.g., videos), providing transferable high-level guidance. Nevertheless, grounding these high-level plans into executable actions remains challenging, especially with the limited availability of high-quality robot data. To this end, we propose to improve the low-level policy through online interactions. Specifically, our approach collects online rollouts, retrospectively annotates the corresponding high-level goals from achieved outcomes, and aggregates these hindsight-relabeled experiences to update a goal-conditioned imitation policy. Our method, Hindsight Flow-conditioned Online Imitation (HinFlow), instantiates this idea with 2D point flows as the high-level planner. Across diverse manipulation tasks in both simulation and physical world, our method achieves more than $2\times$ performance improvement over the base policy, significantly outperforming the existing methods. Moreover, our framework enables policy acquisition from planners trained on cross-embodiment video data, demonstrating its potential for scalable and transferable robot learning.</p></details> |  |

To fully unlock the potential of IL for surgery, access to clinical datasets is needed, which unfortunately lack the kinematic data required for current IL approaches. A promising source of large-scale surgical demonstrations is monocular surgical videos available online, making monocular pose estimation a crucial step toward enabling large-scale robot learning. Toward this end, we propose SurgiPose, a differentiable rendering based approach to estimate kinematic information from monocular surgical videos, eliminating the need for direct access to ground truth kinematics. Our method infers tool trajectories and joint angles by optimizing tool pose parameters to minimize the discrepancy between rendered and real images. To evaluate the effectiveness of our approach, we conduct experiments on two robotic surgical tasks: tissue lifting and needle pickup, using the da Vinci Research Kit Si (dVRK Si). We train imitation learning policies with both ground truth measured kinematics and estimated kinematics from video and compare their performance. Our results show that policies trained on estimated kinematics achieve comparable success rates to those trained on ground truth data, demonstrating the feasibility of using monocular video based kinematic estimation for surgical robot learning. By enabling kinematic estimation from monocular surgical videos, our work lays the foundation for large scale learning of autonomous surgical policies from online surgical data.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 6 figures, 2 tables</p></details> |

While simulation has become a promising way for scaling up data collection, the related tasks, including simulation task design, task-aware scene generation, expert demonstration synthesis, and sim-to-real transfer, still demand substantial human effort. We present AnyTask, an automated framework that pairs massively parallel GPU simulation with foundation models to design diverse manipulation tasks and synthesize robot data. We introduce three AnyTask agents for generating expert demonstrations aiming to solve as many tasks as possible: 1) ViPR, a novel task and motion planning agent with VLM-in-the-loop Parallel Refinement; 2) ViPR-Eureka, a reinforcement learning agent with generated dense rewards and LLM-guided contact sampling; 3) ViPR-RL, a hybrid planning and learning approach that jointly produces high-quality demonstrations with only sparse rewards. We train behavior cloning policies on generated data, validate them in simulation, and deploy them directly on real robot hardware. The policies generalize to novel object poses, achieving 44% average success across a suite of real-world pick-and-place, drawer opening, contact-rich pushing, and long-horizon manipulation tasks.

This paper proposes a safety-aware approach to mitigate efficiency losses without assuming prior knowledge of safety logic. Using a deep-learning model, the robot learns the relationship between system state and safety-induced speed reductions based on execution data. Our framework does not explicitly predict human motions but directly models the interaction effects on robot speed, simplifying implementation and enhancing generalizability to different safety logics. At runtime, the learned model optimizes task selection to minimize cycle time while adhering to safety requirements. Experiments on a pick-and-packaging scenario demonstrated significant reductions in cycle times.</p></details> | 8 pages |

Yet existing methods rely on intermediate representations such as keypoints or trajectories, introducing information loss and cumulative errors that harm temporal and visual consistency. We present Mitty, a Diffusion Transformer that enables video In-Context Learning for end-to-end Human2Robot video generation. Built on a pretrained video diffusion model, Mitty leverages strong visual-temporal priors to translate human demonstrations into robot-execution videos without action labels or intermediate abstractions. Demonstration videos are compressed into condition tokens and fused with robot denoising tokens through bidirectional attention during diffusion. To mitigate paired-data scarcity, we also develop an automatic synthesis pipeline that produces high-quality human-robot pairs from large egocentric datasets. Experiments on Human2Robot and EPIC-Kitchens show that Mitty delivers state-of-the-art results, strong generalization to unseen environments, and new insights for scalable robot learning from human observations.</p></details> |  |
| **[PolaRiS: Scalable Real-to-Sim Evaluations for Generalist Robot Policies](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16881v1)** | 2025-12-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A significant challenge for robot learning research is our ability to accurately measure and compare the performance of robot policies. Benchmarking in robotics is historically challenging due to the stochasticity, reproducibility, and time-consuming nature of real-world rollouts. This challenge is exacerbated for recent generalist policies, which has to be evaluated across a wide variety of scenes and tasks. Evaluation in simulation offers a scalable complement to real world evaluations, but the visual and physical domain gap between existing simulation benchmarks and the real world has made them an unreliable signal for policy improvement. Furthermore, building realistic and diverse simulated environments has traditionally required significant human effort and expertise. To bridge the gap, we introduce Policy Evaluation and Environment Reconstruction in Simulation (PolaRiS), a scalable real-to-sim framework for high-fidelity simulated robot evaluation. PolaRiS utilizes neural reconstruction methods to turn short video scans of real-world scenes into interactive simulation environments. Additionally, we develop a simple simulation data co-training recipe that bridges remaining real-to-sim gaps and enables zero-shot evaluation in unseen simulation environments. Through extensive paired evaluations between simulation and the real world, we demonstrate that PolaRiS evaluations provide a much stronger correlation to real world generalist policy performance than existing simulated benchmarks. Its simplicity also enables rapid creation of diverse simulated environments. As such, this work takes a step towards distributed and democratized evaluation for the next generation of robotic foundation models.</p></details> | <details><summary>Websi...</summary><p>Website: https://polaris-evals.github.io/</p></details> |

Our approach automatically provides action labels for video diffusion models, overcoming the common lack of action annotations and enabling their full use for robotic policy learning. Existing methods either adopt two-stage pipelines, which limit tightly coupled cross-modal information sharing, or rely on adapting a single-modal diffusion model for a joint distribution that cannot fully leverage pretrained video knowledge. To overcome these limitations, we (1) extend a pretrained video diffusion model with a parallel, dedicated action diffusion model that preserves pretrained knowledge, (2) introduce a Bridge Attention mechanism to enable effective cross-modal interaction, and (3) design an action refinement module to convert coarse actions into precise controls for low-resolution datasets. Extensive evaluations on multiple public benchmarks and real-world datasets demonstrate that our method generates higher-quality videos, more accurate actions, and significantly outperforms existing baselines, offering a scalable framework for leveraging large-scale video data for robotic learning.</p></details> | 9 pages, 7 figures |

Pixels contain information at all levels, ranging from low-level attributes to high-level concepts. Autoencoders represent a classical and long-standing paradigm for learning representations from pixels or other raw inputs. In this work, we demonstrate that autoencoder-based self-supervised learning remains competitive today and can produce strong representations for downstream tasks, while remaining simple, stable, and efficient. Our model, codenamed "Pixio", is an enhanced masked autoencoder (MAE) with more challenging pre-training tasks and more capable architectures. The model is trained on 2B web-crawled images with a self-curation strategy with minimal human curation. Pixio performs competitively across a wide range of downstream tasks in the wild, including monocular depth estimation (e.g., Depth Anything), feed-forward 3D reconstruction (i.e., MapAnything), semantic segmentation, and robot learning, outperforming or matching DINOv3 trained at similar scales. Our results suggest that pixel-space self-supervised learning can serve as a promising alternative and a complement to latent-space approaches.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://github.com/facebookresearch/pixio</p></details> |
| **[Large Video Planner Enables Generalizable Robot Control](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15840v1)** | 2025-12-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>General-purpose robots require decision-making models that generalize across diverse tasks and environments. Recent works build robot foundation models by extending multimodal large language models (MLLMs) with action outputs, creating vision-language-action (VLA) systems. These efforts are motivated by the intuition that MLLMs' large-scale language and image pretraining can be effectively transferred to the action output modality. In this work, we explore an alternative paradigm of using large-scale video pretraining as a primary modality for building robot foundation models. Unlike static images and language, videos capture spatio-temporal sequences of states and actions in the physical world that are naturally aligned with robotic behavior. We curate an internet-scale video dataset of human activities and task demonstrations, and train, for the first time at a foundation-model scale, an open video model for generative robotics planning. The model produces zero-shot video plans for novel scenes and tasks, which we post-process to extract executable robot actions. We evaluate task-level generalization through third-party selected tasks in the wild and real-robot experiments, demonstrating successful physical execution. Together, these results show robust instruction following, strong generalization, and real-world feasibility. We release both the model and dataset to support open, reproducible video-based robot learning.

Despite the success of reinforcement learning (RL) in this domain, its sample inefficiency remains a significant challenge due to the intricate dynamics and partial observability of humanoid robots. To address this limitation, we propose PvP, a Proprioceptive-Privileged contrastive learning framework that leverages the intrinsic complementarity between proprioceptive and privileged states. PvP learns compact and task-relevant latent representations without requiring hand-crafted data augmentations, enabling faster and more stable policy learning. To support systematic evaluation, we develop SRL4Humanoid, the first unified and modular framework that provides high-quality implementations of representative state representation learning (SRL) methods for humanoid robot learning. Extensive experiments on the LimX Oli robot across velocity tracking and motion imitation tasks demonstrate that PvP significantly improves sample efficiency and final performance compared to baseline SRL methods. Our study further provides practical insights into integrating SRL with RL for humanoid WBC, offering valuable guidance for data-efficient humanoid robot learning.</p></details> | 13 pages, 12 figures |

However, most existing approaches rely on 2D visual inputs to perform actions in 3D physical environments, creating a significant gap between perception and action grounding. To bridge this gap, we propose a Spatial-Aware VLA Pretraining paradigm that performs explicit alignment between visual space and physical space during pretraining, enabling models to acquire 3D spatial understanding before robot policy learning. Starting from pretrained vision-language models, we leverage large-scale human demonstration videos to extract 3D visual and 3D action annotations, forming a new source of supervision that aligns 2D visual observations with 3D spatial reasoning. We instantiate this paradigm with VIPA-VLA, a dual-encoder architecture that incorporates a 3D visual encoder to augment semantic visual representations with 3D-aware features. When adapted to downstream robot tasks, VIPA-VLA achieves significantly improved grounding between 2D vision and 3D action, resulting in more robust and generalizable robotic policies.</p></details> |  |

However, most existing systems only offer unilateral robot control and lack the ability to synchronize the robot's status with the teleoperation hardware, preventing real-time, flexible intervention. In this work, we introduce HACTS (Human-As-Copilot Teleoperation System), a novel system that establishes bilateral, real-time joint synchronization between a robot arm and teleoperation hardware. This simple yet effective feedback mechanism, akin to a steering wheel in autonomous vehicles, enables the human copilot to intervene seamlessly while collecting action-correction data for future learning. Implemented using 3D-printed components and low-cost, off-the-shelf motors, HACTS is both accessible and scalable. Our experiments show that HACTS significantly enhances performance in imitation learning (IL) and reinforcement learning (RL) tasks, boosting IL recovery capabilities and data efficiency, and facilitating human-in-the-loop RL. HACTS paves the way for more effective and interactive human-robot collaboration and data-collection, advancing the capabilities of robot manipulation.</p></details> |  |

However, inferring 4D interactions from a single RGB view is highly challenging due to the unknown object and human information, depth ambiguity, occlusion, and complex motion, which hinder consistent 3D and temporal reconstruction. Previous methods simplify the setup by assuming ground truth object template or constraining to a limited set of object categories. We present CARI4D, the first category-agnostic method that reconstructs spatially and temporarily consistent 4D human-object interaction at metric scale from monocular RGB videos. To this end, we propose a pose hypothesis selection algorithm that robustly integrates the individual predictions from foundation models, jointly refine them through a learned render-and-compare paradigm to ensure spatial, temporal and pixel alignment, and finally reasoning about intricate contacts for further refinement satisfying physical constraints. Experiments show that our method outperforms prior art by 38% on in-distribution dataset and 36% on unseen dataset in terms of reconstruction error. Our model generalizes beyond the training categories and thus can be applied zero-shot to in-the-wild internet videos. Our code and pretrained models will be publicly released.</p></details> | <details><summary>14 pa...</summary><p>14 pages, 8 figures, 4 tables.

Compared to the wide application of binary human feedback, scalar human feedback has been used less because it is believed to be noisy and unstable. In this paper, we compare scalar and binary feedback, and demonstrate that scalar feedback benefits learning when properly handled. We collected binary or scalar feedback respectively from two groups of crowdworkers on a robot task. We found that when considering how consistently a participant labeled the same data, scalar feedback led to less consistency than binary feedback; however, the difference vanishes if small mismatches are allowed. Additionally, scalar and binary feedback show no significant differences in their correlations with key Reinforcement Learning targets. We then introduce Stabilizing TEacher Assessment DYnamics (STEADY) to improve learning from scalar feedback. Based on the idea that scalar feedback is muti-distributional, STEADY re-constructs underlying positive and negative feedback distributions and re-scales scalar feedback based on feedback statistics. We show that models trained with \textit{scalar feedback + STEADY } outperform baselines, including binary feedback and raw scalar feedback, in a robot reaching task with non-expert human feedback. Our results show that both binary feedback and scalar feedback are dynamic, and scalar feedback is a promising signal for use in interactive Reinforcement Learning.</p></details> |  |

We introduce Compliant Residual DAgger (CR-DAgger), which contains two novel components: 1) a Compliant Intervention Interface that leverages compliance control, allowing humans to provide gentle, accurate delta action corrections without interrupting the ongoing robot policy execution; and 2) a Compliant Residual Policy formulation that learns from human corrections while incorporating force feedback and force control. Our system significantly enhances performance on precise contact-rich manipulation tasks using minimal correction data, improving base policy success rates by over 50\% on two challenging tasks (book flipping and belt assembly) while outperforming both retraining-from-scratch and finetuning approaches.

We propose a video-to-video translation framework that converts ordinary human-object interaction videos into motion-consistent robot manipulation videos with realistic, physically grounded interactions. Our approach does not require any paired human-robot videos for training only a set of unpaired robot videos, making the system easy to scale. We introduce a transferable representation that bridges the embodiment gap: by inpainting the robot arm in training videos to obtain a clean background and overlaying a simple visual cue (a marker and arrow indicating the gripper's position and orientation), we can condition a generative model to insert the robot arm back into the scene. At test time, we apply the same process to human videos (inpainting the person and overlaying human pose cues) and generate high-quality robot videos that mimic the human's actions. We fine-tune a SOTA video diffusion model (Wan 2.2) in an in-context learning manner to ensure temporal coherence and leveraging of its rich prior knowledge. Empirical results demonstrate that our approach achieves significantly more realistic and grounded robot motions compared to baselines, pointing to a promising direction for scaling up robot learning from unlabeled human videos.

While recent advances in deep reinforcement learning (DRL) have enabled end-to-end flight control, the field still lacks systematic design guidelines and a unified infrastructure to support reproducible training and real-world deployment. We present a task-oriented framework for end-to-end DRL in quadrotors that integrates design principles for complex task specification and reveals the interdependencies among simulated task definition, training design principles, and physical deployment. Our framework involves software infrastructure, hardware platforms, and open-source firmware to support a full-stack learning infrastructure and workflow. Extensive empirical results demonstrate robust flight and sim-to-real generalization under real-world disturbances.

Many such tasks inherently demand multimodal reasoning; for example, filling a bottle with water will lead to visual information alone being ambiguous or incomplete, thereby requiring reasoning over the temporal evolution of audio, accounting for its underlying physical properties and pitch patterns. In this paper, we propose a generative latent flow matching model to anticipate future audio observations, enabling the system to reason about long-term consequences when integrated into a robot policy. We demonstrate the superior capabilities of our system through two manipulation tasks that require perceiving in-the-wild audio or music signals, compared to methods without future lookahead. We further emphasize that successful robot action learning for these tasks relies not merely on multi-modal input, but critically on the accurate prediction of future audio states that embody intrinsic rhythmic patterns.</p></details> |  |

In this work, inspired by the denoising capability of diffusion models, we invert the conventional perspective and propose a clean-to-noisy paradigm that learns to synthesize noisy depth, thereby bridging the visual sim2real gap through purely simulation-driven robotic learning. Building on this idea, we introduce RealD$^2$iff, a hierarchical coarse-to-fine diffusion framework that decomposes depth noise into global structural distortions and fine-grained local perturbations. To enable progressive learning of these components, we further develop two complementary strategies: Frequency-Guided Supervision (FGS) for global structure modeling and Discrepancy-Guided Optimization (DGO) for localized refinement. To integrate RealD$^2$iff seamlessly into imitation learning, we construct a pipeline that spans six stages. We provide comprehensive empirical and experimental validation demonstrating the effectiveness of this paradigm. RealD$^2$iff enables two key applications: (1) generating real-world-like depth to construct clean-noisy paired datasets without manual sensor data collection. (2) Achieving zero-shot sim2real robot manipulation, substantially improving real-world performance without additional fine-tuning.</p></details> | <details><summary>We ar...</summary><p>We are the author team of the paper "RealD$^2$iff: Bridging Real-World Gap in Robot Manipulation via Depth Diffusion".

However, their core process of action tokenization often involves a trade-off between reconstruction fidelity and inference efficiency. We introduce FASTer, a unified framework for efficient and generalizable robot learning that integrates a learnable tokenizer with an autoregressive policy built upon it. FASTerVQ encodes action chunks as single-channel images, capturing global spatio-temporal dependencies while maintaining a high compression ratio. FASTerVLA builds on this tokenizer with block-wise autoregressive decoding and a lightweight action expert, achieving both faster inference and higher task performance. Extensive experiments across simulated and real-world benchmarks show that FASTerVQ delivers superior reconstruction quality, high token utilization, and strong cross-task and cross-embodiment generalization, while FASTerVLA further improves overall capability, surpassing previous state-of-the-art VLA models in both inference speed and task performance.</p></details> |  |

While recent Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models leverage large pre-trained understanding models for perception and instruction following, their ability to generalize to novel tasks, objects, and settings remains limited. In this work, we present VideoVLA, a simple approach that explores the potential of transforming large video generation models into robotic VLA manipulators. Given a language instruction and an image, VideoVLA predicts an action sequence as well as the future visual outcomes. Built on a multi-modal Diffusion Transformer, VideoVLA jointly models video, language, and action modalities, using pre-trained video generative models for joint visual and action forecasting. Our experiments show that high-quality imagined futures correlate with reliable action predictions and task success, highlighting the importance of visual imagination in manipulation. VideoVLA demonstrates strong generalization, including imitating other embodiments' skills and handling novel objects.

For humanoid robots, human videos and motion data are abundant and widely available, offering a free and large-scale data source. Besides, the semantics related to the motions enable modality alignment and high-level robot control learning. However, how to effectively mine raw video, extract robot-learnable representations, and leverage them for scalable learning remains an open problem. To address this, we introduce Humanoid-Union, a large-scale dataset generated through an autonomous pipeline, comprising over 260 hours of diverse, high-quality humanoid robot motion data with semantic annotations derived from human motion videos. The dataset can be further expanded via the same pipeline. Building on this data resource, we propose SCHUR, a scalable learning framework designed to explore the impact of large-scale data on high-level control in humanoid robots. Experimental results demonstrate that SCHUR achieves high robot motion generation quality and strong text-motion alignment under data and model scaling, with 37\% reconstruction improvement under MPJPE and 25\% alignment improvement under FID comparing with previous methods. Its effectiveness is further validated through deployment in real-world humanoid robot.</p></details> |  |

Traditional rule-based methods often struggle to achieve accurate ball control due to their reliance on fixed walking patterns and limited adaptability to real-time ball dynamics. To address these challenges, we propose a two-stage curriculum learning framework that enables a humanoid robot to acquire dribbling skills without explicit dynamics or predefined trajectories. In the first stage, the robot learns basic locomotion skills; in the second stage, we fine-tune the policy for agile dribbling maneuvers. We further introduce a virtual camera model in simulation that simulates the field of view and perception constraints of the real robot, enabling realistic ball perception during training. We also design heuristic rewards to encourage active sensing, promoting a broader visual range for continuous ball perception. The policy is trained in simulation and successfully transferred to a physical humanoid robot. Experiment results demonstrate that our method enables effective ball manipulation, achieving flexible and visually appealing dribbling behaviors across multiple environments. This work highlights the potential of reinforcement learning in developing agile humanoid soccer robots.

Despite these exceptional capabilities, controllable video models often hallucinate - generating future video frames that are misaligned with physical reality - which raises serious concerns in many tasks such as robot policy evaluation and planning. However, state-of-the-art video models lack the ability to assess and express their confidence, impeding hallucination mitigation. To rigorously address this challenge, we propose C3, an uncertainty quantification (UQ) method for training continuous-scale calibrated controllable video models for dense confidence estimation at the subpatch level, precisely localizing the uncertainty in each generated video frame. Our UQ method introduces three core innovations to empower video models to estimate their uncertainty. First, our method develops a novel framework that trains video models for correctness and calibration via strictly proper scoring rules. Second, we estimate the video model's uncertainty in latent space, avoiding training instability and prohibitive training costs associated with pixel-space approaches. Third, we map the dense latent-space uncertainty to interpretable pixel-level uncertainty in the RGB space for intuitive visualization, providing high-resolution uncertainty heatmaps that identify untrustworthy regions. Through extensive experiments on large-scale robot learning datasets (Bridge and DROID) and real-world evaluations, we demonstrate that our method not only provides calibrated uncertainty estimates within the training distribution, but also enables effective out-of-distribution detection.</p></details> |  |

The proposed method integrates two complementary modules: an error-based selection module utilizing photometric and structural similarity (SSIM) errors, and a momentum-based update module that dynamically adjusts keyframe selection thresholds according to scene motion dynamics. By dynamically curating the most informative frames, our approach addresses a key data bottleneck in real-time perception. This allows for the creation of high-quality 3D world representations from a compressed data stream, a critical step towards scalable robot learning and deployment in complex, dynamic environments. Experimental results demonstrate significant improvements over traditional static keyframe selection strategies, such as fixed temporal intervals or uniform frame skipping. These findings highlight a meaningful advancement toward adaptive perception systems that can dynamically respond to complex and evolving visual scenes. We evaluate our proposed adaptive keyframe selection module on two recent state-of-the-art 3D reconstruction networks, Spann3r and CUT3R, and observe consistent improvements in reconstruction quality across both frameworks. Furthermore, an extensive ablation study confirms the effectiveness of each individual component in our method, underlining their contribution to the overall performance gains.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ROBOVIS 2026</p></details> |

We attribute this gap to two factors: the lack of state-action-state dynamics modeling and the unnecessary redundancy of explicit geometric reconstruction. We introduce AFRO, a self-supervised framework that learns dynamics-aware 3D representations without action or reconstruction supervision. AFRO casts state prediction as a generative diffusion process and jointly models forward and inverse dynamics in a shared latent space to capture causal transition structure. To prevent feature leakage in action learning, we employ feature differencing and inverse-consistency supervision, improving the quality and stability of visual features. When combined with Diffusion Policy, AFRO substantially increases manipulation success rates across 16 simulated and 4 real-world tasks, outperforming existing pre-training approaches. The framework also scales favorably with data volume and task complexity. Qualitative visualizations indicate that AFRO learns semantically rich, discriminative features, offering an effective pre-training solution for 3D representation learning in robotics.

However, generative models within this field face a fundamental trade-off between the slow, iterative sampling of diffusion models and the architectural constraints of faster Flow-based methods, which often rely on explicit consistency losses. To address these limitations, we introduce MP1, which pairs 3D point-cloud inputs with the MeanFlow paradigm to generate action trajectories in one network function evaluation (1-NFE). By directly learning the interval-averaged velocity via the "MeanFlow Identity", our policy avoids any additional consistency constraints. This formulation eliminates numerical ODE-solver errors during inference, yielding more precise trajectories. MP1 further incorporates CFG for improved trajectory controllability while retaining 1-NFE inference without reintroducing structural constraints. Because subtle scene-context variations are critical for robot learning, especially in few-shot learning, we introduce a lightweight Dispersive Loss that repels state embeddings during training, boosting generalization without slowing inference. We validate our method on the Adroit and Meta-World benchmarks, as well as in real-world scenarios. Experimental results show MP1 achieves superior average task success rates, outperforming DP3 by 10.2% and FlowPolicy by 7.3%. Its average inference time is only 6.8 ms-19x faster than DP3 and nearly 2x faster than FlowPolicy.

We argue this provides an insufficient representation and propose the Vision Action Transformer (VAT), a novel architecture that is extended from ViT and unlocks the full feature hierarchy of ViT. VAT processes specialized action tokens with visual features across all transformer layers, enabling a deep and progressive fusion of perception and action generation. On a suite of simulated manipulation tasks, VAT achieves a 98.15\% average success rate across four LIBERO benchmarks, establishing a new state-of-the-art by outperforming prior methods like OpenVLA-OFT. Our work presents not only a powerful model for imitation learning but also demonstrates the critical importance of leveraging the complete ''representation trajectory'' of vision models to advance robotic policy.

From monocular RGB or RGB-D inputs, we perform high precision HOI reconstruction and enforce physical plausibility via a reinforcement learning (RL) optimizer that refines hand object relative poses under contact and penetration constraints. The reconstructed, contact rich trajectories are then retargeted to cross-embodiments, robot arms with simple end effectors, dexterous hands, and humanoids, yielding executable actions and rollouts. To scale coverage, we build a simulation-augmented framework on Isaac Sim with diverse domain randomization (embodiments, trajectories, object retrieval, background textures, hand motion mirroring), which enriches the distributions of trajectories and observations while preserving spatial relationships and physical plausibility. The entire data pipeline forms an end to end pipeline from video,reconstruction,retargeting,augmentation data acquisition. We validate the data on mainstream vision language action (VLA) and imitation learning architectures, demonstrating that trajectories produced by our pipeline are as stable as those from teleoperation and yield comparable continual performance gains. To our knowledge, this provides the first quantitative evidence that HOI modalities can serve as effective supervision for robotic learning. Compared with teleoperation, Robowheel is lightweight, a single monocular RGB(D) camera is sufficient to extract a universal, embodiment agnostic motion representation that could be flexibly retargeted across embodiments. We further assemble a large scale multimodal dataset combining multi-camera captures, monocular videos, and public HOI corpora for training and evaluating embodied models.</p></details> | 27 Pages, 21 figures |

| **[IGen: Scalable Data Generation for Robot Learning from Open-World Images](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01773v1)** | 2025-12-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rise of generalist robotic policies has created an exponential demand for large-scale training data. However, on-robot data collection is labor-intensive and often limited to specific environments. In contrast, open-world images capture a vast diversity of real-world scenes that naturally align with robotic manipulation tasks, offering a promising avenue for low-cost, large-scale robot data acquisition. Despite this potential, the lack of associated robot actions hinders the practical use of open-world images for robot learning, leaving this rich visual resource largely unexploited. To bridge this gap, we propose IGen, a framework that scalably generates realistic visual observations and executable actions from open-world images. IGen first converts unstructured 2D pixels into structured 3D scene representations suitable for scene understanding and manipulation. It then leverages the reasoning capabilities of vision-language models to transform scene-specific task instructions into high-level plans and generate low-level actions as SE(3) end-effector pose sequences. From these poses, it synthesizes dynamic scene evolution and renders temporally coherent visual observations. Experiments validate the high quality of visuomotor data generated by IGen, and show that policies trained solely on IGen-synthesized data achieve performance comparable to those trained on real-world data. This highlights the potential of IGen to support scalable data generation from open-world images for generalist robotic policy training.</p></details> | 8 pages, 8 figures |
| **[Real-World Reinforcement Learning of Active Perception Behaviors](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01188v1)** | 2025-12-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A robot's instantaneous sensory observations do not always reveal task-relevant state information. Under such partial observability, optimal behavior typically involves explicitly acting to gain the missing information. Today's standard robot learning techniques struggle to produce such active perception behaviors. We propose a simple real-world robot learning recipe to efficiently train active perception policies. Our approach, asymmetric advantage weighted regression (AAWR), exploits access to "privileged" extra sensors at training time. The privileged sensors enable training high-quality privileged value functions that aid in estimating the advantage of the target policy. Bootstrapping from a small number of potentially suboptimal demonstrations and an easy-to-obtain coarse policy initialization, AAWR quickly acquires active perception behaviors and boosts task performance. In evaluations on 8 manipulation tasks on 3 robots spanning varying degrees of partial observability, AAWR synthesizes reliable active perception behaviors that outperform all prior approaches. When initialized with a "generalist" robot policy that struggles with active perception tasks, AAWR efficiently generates information-gathering behaviors that allow it to operate under severe partial observability for manipulation tasks.

Building on these advances, we develop a teacher-student-bootstrap learning framework for vision-based humanoid loco-manipulation, using articulated-object interaction as a representative high-difficulty benchmark. Our approach introduces a staged-reset exploration strategy that stabilizes long-horizon privileged-policy training, and a GRPO-based fine-tuning procedure that mitigates partial observability and improves closed-loop consistency in sim-to-real RL. Trained entirely on simulation data, the resulting policy achieves robust zero-shot performance across diverse door types and outperforms human teleoperators by up to 31.7% in task completion time under the same whole-body control stack. This represents the first humanoid sim-to-real policy capable of diverse articulated loco-manipulation using pure RGB perception.</p></details> | <details><summary>https...</summary><p>https://doorman-humanoid.github.io/</p></details> |

Though recent results show that learning from demonstration, also known as imitation learning (IL), can suffer errors that compound exponentially with task horizon in continuous settings, we demonstrate that action chunking and exploratory data collection circumvent exponential compounding errors in different regimes. Our results identify control-theoretic stability as the key mechanism underlying the benefits of these interventions. On the empirical side, we validate our predictions and the role of control-theoretic stability through experimentation on popular robot learning benchmarks. On the theoretical side, we demonstrate that the control-theoretic lens provides fine-grained insights into how compounding error arises, leading to tighter statistical guarantees on imitation learning error when these interventions are applied than previous techniques based on information-theoretic considerations alone.</p></details> | <details><summary>Updat...</summary><p>Updated manuscript.

Learning to manipulate granular materials based on physical information obtained through precise modelling remains an unsolved problem. In this paper, we propose to address this challenge by constructing a differentiable physics-based simulator for granular materials using the Taichi programming language and developing a learning framework accelerated by demonstrations generated through gradient-based optimisation on non-granular materials within our simulator, eliminating the costly data collection and model training of prior methods. Experimental results show that our method, with its flexible design, trains robust policies that are capable of executing the task of transporting granular materials in both simulated and real-world environments, beyond the capabilities of standard reinforcement learning, imitation learning, and prior task-specific granular manipulation methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted as a regular paper by IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks and Learning Systems (TNNLS)</p></details> |
| **[Learning Primitive Embodied World Models: Towards Scalable Robotic Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20840v3)** | 2025-11-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While video-generation-based embodied world models have gained increasing attention, their reliance on large-scale embodied interaction data remains a key bottleneck. The scarcity, difficulty of collection, and high dimensionality of embodied data fundamentally limit the alignment granularity between language and actions and exacerbate the challenge of long-horizon video generation--hindering generative models from achieving a "GPT moment" in the embodied domain. There is a naive observation: the diversity of embodied data far exceeds the relatively small space of possible primitive motions. Based on this insight, we propose a novel paradigm for world modeling--Primitive Embodied World Models (PEWM). By restricting video generation to fixed short horizons, our approach 1) enables fine-grained alignment between linguistic concepts and visual representations of robotic actions, 2) reduces learning complexity, 3) improves data efficiency in embodied data collection, and 4) decreases inference latency. By equipping with a modular Vision-Language Model (VLM) planner and a Start-Goal heatmap Guidance mechanism (SGG), PEWM further enables flexible closed-loop control and supports compositional generalization of primitive-level policies over extended, complex tasks. Our framework leverages the spatiotemporal vision priors in video models and the semantic awareness of VLMs to bridge the gap between fine-grained physical interaction and high-level reasoning, paving the way toward scalable, interpretable, and general-purpose embodied intelligence.</p></details> |  |
| **[Mask2IV: Interaction-Centric Video Generation via Mask Trajectories](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03135v2)** | 2025-11-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generating interaction-centric videos, such as those depicting humans or robots interacting with objects, is crucial for embodied intelligence, as they provide rich and diverse visual priors for robot learning, manipulation policy training, and affordance reasoning. However, existing methods often struggle to model such complex and dynamic interactions. While recent studies show that masks can serve as effective control signals and enhance generation quality, obtaining dense and precise mask annotations remains a major challenge for real-world use. To overcome this limitation, we introduce Mask2IV, a novel framework specifically designed for interaction-centric video generation. It adopts a decoupled two-stage pipeline that first predicts plausible motion trajectories for both actor and object, then generates a video conditioned on these trajectories. This design eliminates the need for dense mask inputs from users while preserving the flexibility to manipulate the interaction process. Furthermore, Mask2IV supports versatile and intuitive control, allowing users to specify the target object of interaction and guide the motion trajectory through action descriptions or spatial position cues. To support systematic training and evaluation, we curate two benchmarks covering diverse action and object categories across both human-object interaction and robotic manipulation scenarios. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves superior visual realism and controllability compared to existing baselines.</p></details> | <details><summary>AAAI ...</summary><p>AAAI 2026.

| **[Green Resilience of Cyber-Physical Systems: Doctoral Dissertation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16593v1)** | 2025-11-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Cyber-physical systems (CPS) combine computational and physical components. Online Collaborative AI System (OL-CAIS) is a type of CPS that learn online in collaboration with humans to achieve a common goal, which makes it vulnerable to disruptive events that degrade performance. Decision-makers must therefore restore performance while limiting energy impact, creating a trade-off between resilience and greenness. This research addresses how to balance these two properties in OL-CAIS. It aims to model resilience for automatic state detection, develop agent-based policies that optimize the greenness-resilience trade-off, and understand catastrophic forgetting to maintain performance consistency. We model OL-CAIS behavior through three operational states: steady, disruptive, and final. To support recovery during disruptions, we introduce the GResilience framework, which provides recovery strategies through multi-objective optimization (one-agent), game-theoretic decision-making (two-agent), and reinforcement learning (RL-agent). We also design a measurement framework to quantify resilience and greenness. Empirical evaluation uses real and simulated experiments with a collaborative robot learning object classification from human demonstrations. Results show that the resilience model captures performance transitions during disruptions, and that GResilience policies improve green recovery by shortening recovery time, stabilizing performance, and reducing human dependency. RL-agent policies achieve the strongest results, although with a marginal increase in CO2 emissions. We also observe catastrophic forgetting after repeated disruptions, while our policies help maintain steadiness. A comparison with containerized execution shows that containerization cuts CO2 emissions by half. Overall, this research provides models, metrics, and policies that ensure the green recovery of OL-CAIS.</p></details> |  |
| **[DynaMimicGen: A Data Generation Framework for Robot Learning of Dynamic Tasks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16223v1)** | 2025-11-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Learning robust manipulation policies typically requires large and diverse datasets, the collection of which is time-consuming, labor-intensive, and often impractical for dynamic environments. In this work, we introduce DynaMimicGen (D-MG), a scalable dataset generation framework that enables policy training from minimal human supervision while uniquely supporting dynamic task settings. Given only a few human demonstrations, D-MG first segments the demonstrations into meaningful sub-tasks, then leverages Dynamic Movement Primitives (DMPs) to adapt and generalize the demonstrated behaviors to novel and dynamically changing environments. Improving prior methods that rely on static assumptions or simplistic trajectory interpolation, D-MG produces smooth, realistic, and task-consistent Cartesian trajectories that adapt in real time to changes in object poses, robot states, or scene geometry during task execution. Our method supports different scenarios - including scene layouts, object instances, and robot configurations - making it suitable for both static and highly dynamic manipulation tasks. We show that robot agents trained via imitation learning on D-MG-generated data achieve strong performance across long-horizon and contact-rich benchmarks, including tasks like cube stacking and placing mugs in drawers, even under unpredictable environment changes. By eliminating the need for extensive human demonstrations and enabling generalization in dynamic settings, D-MG offers a powerful and efficient alternative to manual data collection, paving the way toward scalable, autonomous robot learning.</p></details> |  |

We present RL-100, a real-world reinforcement learning framework built on diffusion-based visuomotor policies. RL-100 unifies imitation and reinforcement learning under a single PPO-style objective applied within the denoising process, yielding conservative and stable policy improvements across both offline and online stages. To meet deployment latency constraints, we employ a lightweight consistency distillation procedure that compresses multi-step diffusion into a one-step controller for high-frequency control. The framework is task-, embodiment-, and representation-agnostic, and supports both single-action outputs and action-chunking control. We evaluate RL-100 on seven diverse real-robot manipulation tasks, ranging from dynamic pushing and agile bowling to pouring, cloth folding, unscrewing, and multi-stage juicing. RL-100 attains 100% success across evaluated trials, achieving 900 out of 900 successful episodes, including up to 250 out of 250 consecutive trials on one task, and matches or surpasses expert teleoperators in time-to-completion. Without retraining, a single policy attains approximately 90% zero-shot success under environmental and dynamics shifts, adapts in a few-shot regime to significant task variations (86.7%), and remains robust to aggressive human perturbations (about 95%). In a public shopping-mall deployment, the juicing robot served random customers continuously for roughly seven hours without failure. Together, these results suggest a practical path toward deployment-ready robot learning: start from human priors, align training objectives with human-grounded metrics, and reliably extend performance beyond human demonstrations.</p></details> | <details><summary>https...</summary><p>https://lei-kun.github.io/RL-100/</p></details> |

Various branches of LfD research (e.g., learned dynamical systems and movement primitives) can generally be classified into ''time-dependent'' or ''time-independent'' systems. Each provides fundamental benefits and drawbacks -- time-independent methods cannot learn overlapping trajectories, while time-dependence can result in undesirable behavior under perturbation. This paper introduces Cluster Alignment for Learned Motions (CALM), an LfD framework dependent upon an alignment with a representative ''mean" trajectory of demonstrated motions rather than pure time- or state-dependence. We discuss the convergence properties of CALM, introduce an alignment technique able to handle the shifts in alignment possible under perturbation, and utilize demonstration clustering to generate multi-modal behavior. We show how CALM mitigates the drawbacks of time-dependent and time-independent techniques on 2D datasets and implement our system on a 7-DoF robot learning tasks in three domains.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 8 figures, originally published in the IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters</p></details> |

However, most existing 3D assets in simulation are rigid, and manually converting them into articulated objects is extremely labor- and cost-intensive. This raises a natural question: can we automatically identify articulable objects in a scene and convert them into articulated assets directly? In this paper, we present ArtiWorld, a scene-aware pipeline that localizes candidate articulable objects from textual scene descriptions and reconstructs executable URDF models that preserve the original geometry. At the core of this pipeline is Arti4URDF, which leverages 3D point cloud, prior knowledge of a large language model (LLM), and a URDF-oriented prompt design to rapidly convert rigid objects into interactive URDF-based articulated objects while maintaining their 3D shape. We evaluate ArtiWorld at three levels: 3D simulated objects, full 3D simulated scenes, and real-world scan scenes. Across all three settings, our method consistently outperforms existing approaches and achieves state-of-the-art performance, while preserving object geometry and correctly capturing object interactivity to produce usable URDF-based articulated models. This provides a practical path toward building interactive, robot-ready simulation environments directly from existing 3D assets. Code and data will be released.</p></details> |  |

Caregiving tasks involve complex physical human-robot interactions, requiring precise perception under occlusions, safe physical contact, and long-horizon planning. While recent advances in robot learning from demonstrations have shown promise, there is a lack of a large-scale, diverse, and expert-driven dataset that captures real-world caregiving routines. To address this gap, we collect data from 21 occupational therapists performing 15 ADL tasks on two manikins. The dataset spans five modalities: RGB-D video, pose tracking, eye-gaze tracking, task and action annotations, and tactile sensing, providing rich multimodal insights into caregiver movement, attention, force application, and task execution strategies. We further analyze expert caregiving principles and strategies, offering insights to improve robot efficiency and task feasibility. Additionally, our evaluations demonstrate that OpenRoboCare presents challenges for state-of-the-art robot perception and human activity recognition methods, both critical for developing safe and adaptive assistive robots, highlighting the value of our contribution.

The Universal Manipulation Interface (UMI) relaxes the strict hardware requirements for data collection, but it is restricted to capturing only RGB images of a scene and omits the 3D geometric information on which many tasks rely. Inspired by DemoGen, we propose UMIGen, a unified framework that consists of two key components: (1) Cloud-UMI, a handheld data collection device that requires no visual SLAM and simultaneously records point cloud observation-action pairs; and (2) a visibility-aware optimization mechanism that extends the DemoGen pipeline to egocentric 3D observations by generating only points within the camera's field of view. These two components enable efficient data generation that aligns with real egocentric observations and can be directly transferred across different robot embodiments without any post-processing. Experiments in both simulated and real-world settings demonstrate that UMIGen supports strong cross-embodiment generalization and accelerates data collection in diverse manipulation tasks.</p></details> |  |

Videos, including those of humans or teleoperated robots, capture rich physical interactions. However, most of them lack labeled actions, which limits their use in robot learning. We present Video Prediction for Robot Actions (ViPRA), a simple pretraining-finetuning framework that learns continuous robot control from these actionless videos. Instead of directly predicting actions, we train a video-language model to predict both future visual observations and motion-centric latent actions, which serve as intermediate representations of scene dynamics. We train these latent actions using perceptual losses and optical flow consistency to ensure they reflect physically grounded behavior. For downstream control, we introduce a chunked flow matching decoder that maps latent actions to robot-specific continuous action sequences, using only 100 to 200 teleoperated demonstrations. This approach avoids expensive action annotation, supports generalization across embodiments, and enables smooth, high-frequency continuous control upto 22 Hz via chunked action decoding. Unlike prior latent action works that treat pretraining as autoregressive policy learning, explicitly models both what changes and how. Our method outperforms strong baselines, with a 16% gain on the SIMPLER benchmark and a 13% improvement across real world manipulation tasks.

| **[A QP Framework for Improving Data Collection: Quantifying Device-Controller Performance in Robot Teleoperation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07720v1)** | 2025-11-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Robot learning empowers the robot system with human brain-like intelligence to autonomously acquire and adapt skills through experience, enhancing flexibility and adaptability in various environments. Aimed at achieving a similar level of capability in large language models (LLMs) for embodied intelligence, data quality plays a crucial role in training a foundational model with diverse robot skills. In this study, we investigate the collection of data for manipulation tasks using teleoperation devices. Different devices yield varying effects when paired with corresponding controller strategies, including position-based inverse kinematics (IK) control, torque-based inverse dynamics (ID) control, and optimization-based compliance control. In this paper, we develop a teleoperation pipeline that is compatible with different teleoperation devices and manipulator controllers. Within the pipeline, we construct the optimal QP formulation with the dynamic nullspace and the impedance tracking as the novel optimal controller to achieve compliant pose tracking and singularity avoidance. Regarding the optimal controller, it adaptively adjusts the weights assignment depending on the robot joint manipulability that reflects the state of joint configuration for the pose tracking in the form of impedance control and singularity avoidance with nullspace tracking. Analysis of quantitative experimental results suggests the quality of the teleoperated trajectory data, including tracking error, occurrence of singularity, and the smoothness of the joints' trajectory, with different combinations of teleoperation interface and the motion controller.</p></details> |  |
| **[Time-Aware Policy Learning for Adaptive and Punctual Robot Control](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07654v1)** | 2025-11-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Temporal awareness underlies intelligent behavior in both animals and humans, guiding how actions are sequenced, paced, and adapted to changing goals and environments. Yet most robot learning algorithms remain blind to time. We introduce time-aware policy learning, a reinforcement learning framework that enables robots to explicitly perceive and reason with time as a first-class variable. The framework augments conventional reinforcement policies with two complementary temporal signals, the remaining time and a time ratio, which allow a single policy to modulate its behavior continuously from rapid and dynamic to cautious and precise execution. By jointly optimizing punctuality and stability, the robot learns to balance efficiency, robustness, resiliency, and punctuality without re-training or reward adjustment. Across diverse manipulation domains from long-horizon pick and place, to granular-media pouring, articulated-object handling, and multi-agent object delivery, the time-aware policy produces adaptive behaviors that outperform standard reinforcement learning baselines by up to 48% in efficiency, 8 times more robust in sim-to-real transfer, and 90% in acoustic quietness while maintaining near-perfect success rates. Explicit temporal reasoning further enables real-time human-in-the-loop control and multi-agent coordination, allowing robots to recover from disturbances, re-synchronize after delays, and align motion tempo with human intent. By treating time not as a constraint but as a controllable dimension of behavior, time-aware policy learning provides a unified foundation for efficient, robust, resilient, and human-aligned robot autonomy.</p></details> |  |

However, established MARL platforms (e.g., SMAC and MPE) lack robotics relevance and hardware deployment, leaving multi-robot learning researchers to develop bespoke environments and hardware testbeds dedicated to the development and evaluation of their individual contributions. The Multi-Agent RL Benchmark and Learning Environment for the Robotarium (MARBLER) is an exciting recent step in providing a standardized robotics-relevant platform for MARL, by bridging the Robotarium testbed with existing MARL software infrastructure. However, MARBLER lacks support for parallelization and GPU/TPU execution, making the platform prohibitively slow compared to modern MARL environments and hindering adoption. We contribute JaxRobotarium, a Jax-powered end-to-end simulation, learning, deployment, and benchmarking platform for the Robotarium. JaxRobotarium enables rapid training and deployment of multi-robot RL (MRRL) policies with realistic robot dynamics and safety constraints, supporting parallelization and hardware acceleration. Our generalizable learning interface integrates easily with SOTA MARL libraries (e.g., JaxMARL). In addition, JaxRobotarium includes eight standardized coordination scenarios, including four novel scenarios that bring established MARL benchmark tasks (e.g., RWARE and Level-Based Foraging) to a robotics setting. We demonstrate that JaxRobotarium retains high simulation fidelity while achieving dramatic speedups over baseline (20x in training and 150x in simulation), and provides an open-access sim-to-real evaluation pipeline through the Robotarium testbed, accelerating and democratizing access to multi-robot learning research and evaluation.

Recent video generation models can synthesize photorealistic visual demonstrations from language commands and images, offering a powerful yet underexplored source of training signals for robotics. However, directly retargeting pixel motions from generated videos to robots neglects physics, often resulting in inaccurate manipulations. PhysWorld addresses this limitation by coupling video generation with physical world reconstruction. Given a single image and a task command, our method generates task-conditioned videos and reconstructs the underlying physical world from the videos, and the generated video motions are grounded into physically accurate actions through object-centric residual reinforcement learning with the physical world model. This synergy transforms implicit visual guidance into physically executable robotic trajectories, eliminating the need for real robot data collection and enabling zero-shot generalizable robotic manipulation.

| **[Rapidly Learning Soft Robot Control via Implicit Time-Stepping](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06667v1)** | 2025-11-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the explosive growth of rigid-body simulators, policy learning in simulation has become the de facto standard for most rigid morphologies. In contrast, soft robotic simulation frameworks remain scarce and are seldom adopted by the soft robotics community. This gap stems partly from the lack of easy-to-use, general-purpose frameworks and partly from the high computational cost of accurately simulating continuum mechanics, which often renders policy learning infeasible. In this work, we demonstrate that rapid soft robot policy learning is indeed achievable via implicit time-stepping. Our simulator of choice, DisMech, is a general-purpose, fully implicit soft-body simulator capable of handling both soft dynamics and frictional contact. We further introduce delta natural curvature control, a method analogous to delta joint position control in rigid manipulators, providing an intuitive and effective means of enacting control for soft robot learning. To highlight the benefits of implicit time-stepping and delta curvature control, we conduct extensive comparisons across four diverse soft manipulator tasks against one of the most widely used soft-body frameworks, Elastica. With implicit time-stepping, parallel stepping of 500 environments achieves up to 6x faster speeds for non-contact cases and up to 40x faster for contact-rich scenarios. Finally, a comprehensive sim-to-sim gap evaluation--training policies in one simulator and evaluating them in another--demonstrates that implicit time-stepping provides a rare free lunch: dramatic speedups achieved without sacrificing accuracy.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code:...</summary><p>Code: https://github.com/QuantuMope/dismech-rl</p></details> |

However, a key hurdle in achieving this goal lies in the robots' ability to manipulate objects in their unstructured surrounding environments according to different tasks. The learning-based approach is considered an effective way to address generalization. The impressive performance of foundation models in the fields of computer vision and natural language suggests the potential of embedding foundation models into manipulation tasks as a viable path toward achieving general manipulation capability. However, we believe achieving general manipulation capability requires an overarching framework akin to auto driving. This framework should encompass multiple functional modules, with different foundation models assuming distinct roles in facilitating general manipulation capability. This survey focuses on the contributions of foundation models to robot learning for manipulation. We propose a comprehensive framework and detail how foundation models can address challenges in each module of the framework. What's more, we examine current approaches, outline challenges, suggest future research directions, and identify potential risks associated with integrating foundation models into this domain.</p></details> |  |

| **[ReGen: Generative Robot Simulation via Inverse Design](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04769v1)** | 2025-11-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Simulation plays a key role in scaling robot learning and validating policies, but constructing simulations remains a labor-intensive process. This paper introduces ReGen, a generative simulation framework that automates simulation design via inverse design. Given a robot's behavior -- such as a motion trajectory or an objective function -- and its textual description, ReGen infers plausible scenarios and environments that could have caused the behavior. ReGen leverages large language models to synthesize scenarios by expanding a directed graph that encodes cause-and-effect relationships, relevant entities, and their properties. This structured graph is then translated into a symbolic program, which configures and executes a robot simulation environment. Our framework supports (i) augmenting simulations based on ego-agent behaviors, (ii) controllable, counterfactual scenario generation, (iii) reasoning about agent cognition and mental states, and (iv) reasoning with distinct sensing modalities, such as braking due to faulty GPS signals. We demonstrate ReGen in autonomous driving and robot manipulation tasks, generating more diverse, complex simulated environments compared to existing simulations with high success rates, and enabling controllable generation for corner cases. This approach enhances the validation of robot policies and supports data or simulation augmentation, advancing scalable robot learning for improved generalization and robustness.

| **[X-Diffusion: Training Diffusion Policies on Cross-Embodiment Human Demonstrations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04671v1)** | 2025-11-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Human videos can be recorded quickly and at scale, making them an appealing source of training data for robot learning. However, humans and robots differ fundamentally in embodiment, resulting in mismatched action execution. Direct kinematic retargeting of human hand motion can therefore produce actions that are physically infeasible for robots. Despite these low-level differences, human demonstrations provide valuable motion cues about how to manipulate and interact with objects. Our key idea is to exploit the forward diffusion process: as noise is added to actions, low-level execution differences fade while high-level task guidance is preserved. We present X-Diffusion, a principled framework for training diffusion policies that maximally leverages human data without learning dynamically infeasible motions. X-Diffusion first trains a classifier to predict whether a noisy action is executed by a human or robot. Then, a human action is incorporated into policy training only after adding sufficient noise such that the classifier cannot discern its embodiment. Actions consistent with robot execution supervise fine-grained denoising at low noise levels, while mismatched human actions provide only coarse guidance at higher noise levels. Our experiments show that naive co-training under execution mismatches degrades policy performance, while X-Diffusion consistently improves it. Across five manipulation tasks, X-Diffusion achieves a 16% higher average success rate than the best baseline. The project website is available at https://portal-cornell.github.io/X-Diffusion/.</p></details> |  |

These issues lead to kinematic misalignments that degrade tracking performance and limit applicability in precision tasks. We propose a subject-specific calibration framework for exoskeleton-based hand tracking that estimates virtual link parameters through residual-weighted optimization. A data-driven approach is introduced to empirically tune cost function weights using motion capture ground truth, enabling accurate and consistent calibration across users. Implemented on the Maestro hand exoskeleton with seven healthy participants, the method achieved substantial reductions in joint and fingertip tracking errors across diverse hand geometries. Qualitative visualizations using a Unity-based virtual hand further demonstrate improved motion fidelity. The proposed framework generalizes to exoskeletons with closed-loop kinematics and minimal sensing, laying the foundation for high-fidelity teleoperation and robot learning applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 10 figures, 1 supplementary video, submitted to RA-L</p></details> |

However, state-of-the-art autoregressive VLAs struggle with multi-robot collaboration. We introduce embodiment transfer learning, denoted as ET-VLA, a novel framework for efficient and effective transfer of pre-trained VLAs to multi-robot. ET-VLA's core is Synthetic Continued Pretraining (SCP), which uses synthetically generated data to warm up the model for the new embodiment, bypassing the need for real human demonstrations and reducing data collection costs. SCP enables the model to learn correct actions and precise action token numbers. Following SCP, the model is fine-tuned on target embodiment data. To further enhance the model performance on multi-embodiment, we present the Embodied Graph-of-Thought technique, a novel approach that formulates each sub-task as a node, that allows the VLA model to distinguish the functionalities and roles of each embodiment during task execution. Our work considers bimanual robots, a simple version of multi-robot to verify our approaches. We validate the effectiveness of our method on both simulation benchmarks and real robots covering three different bimanual embodiments. In particular, our proposed ET-VLA \space can outperform OpenVLA on six real-world tasks over 53.2%. We will open-source all codes to support the community in advancing VLA models for robot learning.</p></details> |  |
| **[Learning from Watching: Scalable Extraction of Manipulation Trajectories from Human Videos](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00024v1)** | 2025-11-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Collecting high-quality data for training large-scale robotic models typically relies on real robot platforms, which is labor-intensive and costly, whether via teleoperation or scripted demonstrations. To scale data collection, many researchers have turned to leveraging human manipulation videos available online. However, current methods predominantly focus on hand detection or object pose estimation, failing to fully exploit the rich interaction cues embedded in these videos. In this work, we propose a novel approach that combines large foundation models for video understanding with point tracking techniques to extract dense trajectories of all task-relevant keypoints during manipulation. This enables more comprehensive utilization of Internet-scale human demonstration videos. Experimental results demonstrate that our method can accurately track keypoints throughout the entire manipulation process, paving the way for more scalable and data-efficient robot learning.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to RSS 2025 Workshop</p></details> |

Recent approaches leveraging video prediction models have shown promising results by learning rich spatiotemporal representations from large-scale datasets. However, these models learn action-agnostic dynamics that cannot distinguish between different control inputs, limiting their utility for precise manipulation tasks and requiring large pretraining datasets. We propose a Dynamics-Aligned Flow Matching Policy (DAP) that integrates dynamics prediction into policy learning. Our method introduces a novel architecture where policy and dynamics models provide mutual corrective feedback during action generation, enabling self-correction and improved generalization. Empirical validation demonstrates generalization performance superior to baseline methods on real-world robotic manipulation tasks, showing particular robustness in OOD scenarios including visual distractions and lighting variations.</p></details> | 9 pages, 6 figures |
| **[SARM: Stage-Aware Reward Modeling for Long Horizon Robot Manipulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25358v3)** | 2025-10-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large-scale robot learning has recently shown promise for enabling robots to perform complex tasks by integrating perception, control, and language understanding. Yet, it struggles with long-horizon, contact-rich manipulation such as deformable object handling, where demonstration quality is inconsistent. Reward modeling offers a natural solution: by providing grounded progress signals, it transforms noisy demonstrations into stable supervision that generalizes across diverse trajectories. We introduce a stage-aware, video-based reward modeling framework that jointly predicts high-level task stages and fine-grained progress. Reward labels are automatically derived from natural language subtask annotations, ensuring consistent progress estimation across variable-length demonstrations. This design overcomes frame-index labeling, which fails in variable-duration tasks like folding a T-shirt. Our reward model demonstrates robustness to variability, generalization to out-of-distribution settings, and strong utility for policy training. Building on it, we propose Reward-Aligned Behavior Cloning (RA-BC), which filters high-quality data and reweights samples by reward. Experiments show the reward model alone outperforms baselines on validation and real robot rollouts. Integrated into RA-BC, our approach achieves 83% success on folding T-shirts from the flattened state and 67% from the crumpled state -- far surpassing vanilla behavior cloning, which attains only 8% and 0% success. Overall, our results highlight reward modeling as a key enabler for scalable, annotation-efficient, and robust imitation learning in long-horizon manipulation.</p></details> |  |
| **[MoTVLA: A Vision-Language-Action Model with Unified Fast-Slow Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18337v3)** | 2025-10-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Integrating visual-language instructions into visuomotor policies is gaining momentum in robot learning for enhancing open-world generalization. Despite promising advances, existing approaches face two challenges: limited language steerability when no generated reasoning is used as a condition, or significant inference latency when reasoning is incorporated. In this work, we introduce MoTVLA, a mixture-of-transformers (MoT)-based vision-language-action (VLA) model that integrates fast-slow unified reasoning with behavior policy learning. MoTVLA preserves the general intelligence of pre-trained VLMs (serving as the generalist) for tasks such as perception, scene understanding, and semantic planning, while incorporating a domain expert, a second transformer that shares knowledge with the pretrained VLM, to generate domain-specific fast reasoning (e.g., robot motion decomposition), thereby improving policy execution efficiency. By conditioning the action expert on decomposed motion instructions, MoTVLA can learn diverse behaviors and substantially improve language steerability. Extensive evaluations across natural language processing benchmarks, robotic simulation environments, and real-world experiments confirm the superiority of MoTVLA in both fast-slow reasoning and manipulation task performance.</p></details> |  |

Each entry combines synchronized multi-view RGB-D, high-precision mocap with MANO hand parameters, and per-frame contact points with physically consistent force profiles. Our real-to-sim pipeline uses reinforcement learning to train policies that control an actuated MANO hand in physics simulation, reproducing human demonstrations while discovering the underlying contact forces that generate the observed object motion. DexCanvas is the first manipulation dataset to combine large-scale real demonstrations, systematic skill coverage based on established taxonomies, and physics-validated contact annotations. The dataset can facilitate research in robotic manipulation learning, contact-rich control, and skill transfer across different hand morphologies.</p></details> |  |
| **[Using Temperature Sampling to Effectively Train Robot Learning Policies on Imbalanced Datasets](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19373v1)** | 2025-10-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Increasingly large datasets of robot actions and sensory observations are being collected to train ever-larger neural networks. These datasets are collected based on tasks and while these tasks may be distinct in their descriptions, many involve very similar physical action sequences (e.g., 'pick up an apple' versus 'pick up an orange'). As a result, many datasets of robotic tasks are substantially imbalanced in terms of the physical robotic actions they represent. In this work, we propose a simple sampling strategy for policy training that mitigates this imbalance. Our method requires only a few lines of code to integrate into existing codebases and improves generalization. We evaluate our method in both pre-training small models and fine-tuning large foundational models. Our results show substantial improvements on low-resource tasks compared to prior state-of-the-art methods, without degrading performance on high-resource tasks. This enables more effective use of model capacity for multi-task policies. We also further validate our approach in a real-world setup on a Franka Panda robot arm across a diverse set of tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Efficient Model-Based Reinforcement Learning for Robot Control via Online Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18518v1)** | 2025-10-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present an online model-based reinforcement learning algorithm suitable for controlling complex robotic systems directly in the real world. Unlike prevailing sim-to-real pipelines that rely on extensive offline simulation and model-free policy optimization, our method builds a dynamics model from real-time interaction data and performs policy updates guided by the learned dynamics model. This efficient model-based reinforcement learning scheme significantly reduces the number of samples to train control policies, enabling direct training on real-world rollout data. This significantly reduces the influence of bias in the simulated data, and facilitates the search for high-performance control policies. We adopt online learning analysis to derive sublinear regret bounds under standard stochastic online optimization assumptions, providing formal guarantees on performance improvement as more interaction data are collected. Experimental evaluations were performed on a hydraulic excavator arm and a soft robot arm, where the algorithm demonstrates strong sample efficiency compared to model-free reinforcement learning methods, reaching comparable performance within hours. Robust adaptation to shifting dynamics was also observed when the payload condition was randomized. Our approach paves the way toward efficient and reliable on-robot learning for a broad class of challenging control tasks.</p></details> |  |

In particular, we are interested on quantifying the utility of contact-based data as contact holds significant information for robot learning. Our approach derives a contact-aware objective function for learning object dynamics and shape from pose and contact data. We show that the contact-aware Fisher-information metric can be used to rank and curate contact-data based on how informative data is for learning. In addition, we find that selecting a reduced dataset based on this ranking improves the learning task while also making learning a deterministic process. Interestingly, our results show that more data is not necessarily advantageous, and rather, less but informative data can accelerate learning, especially depending on the contact interactions. Last, we show how our metric can be used to provide initial guidance on data curation for contact-based robot learning.</p></details> |  |

While curated datasets can help, challenges remain in generalizability and real-world transfer. Meanwhile, large-scale "in-the-wild" video datasets have driven progress in computer vision through self-supervised techniques. Translating this to robotics, recent works have explored learning manipulation skills by passively watching abundant videos sourced online. Showing promising results, such video-based learning paradigms provide scalable supervision while reducing dataset bias. This survey reviews foundations such as video feature representation learning techniques, object affordance understanding, 3D hand/body modeling, and large-scale robot resources, as well as emerging techniques for acquiring robot manipulation skills from uncontrolled video demonstrations. We discuss how learning only from observing large-scale human videos can enhance generalization and sample efficiency for robotic manipulation.

| **[From Perception Logs to Failure Modes: Language-Driven Semantic Clustering of Failures for Robot Safety](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06570v2)** | 2025-10-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As robotic systems become increasingly integrated into real-world environments -- ranging from autonomous vehicles to household assistants -- they inevitably encounter diverse and unstructured scenarios that lead to failures. While such failures pose safety and reliability challenges, they also provide rich perceptual data for improving future performance. However, manually analyzing large-scale failure datasets is impractical. In this work, we present a method for automatically organizing large-scale robotic failure data into semantically meaningful failure clusters, enabling scalable learning from failure without human supervision. Our approach leverages the reasoning capabilities of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), trained on internet-scale data, to infer high-level failure causes from raw perceptual trajectories and discover interpretable structure within uncurated failure logs. These semantic clusters reveal patterns and hypothesized causes of failure, enabling scalable learning from experience. We demonstrate that the discovered failure modes can guide targeted data collection for policy refinement, accelerating iterative improvement in agent policies and overall safety. Additionally, we show that these semantic clusters can benefit online failure monitoring systems, offering a lightweight yet powerful safeguard for real-time operation. We demonstrate that this framework enhances robot learning and robustness by transforming real-world failures into actionable and interpretable signals for adaptation.</p></details> |  |

For robots, however, this capability remains a substantial challenge, as they cannot interpret abstract instructions and translate them into executable actions. In this paper, we present Manual2Skill, a novel framework that enables robots to perform complex assembly tasks guided by high-level manual instructions. Our approach leverages a Vision-Language Model (VLM) to extract structured information from instructional images and then uses this information to construct hierarchical assembly graphs. These graphs represent parts, subassemblies, and the relationships between them. To facilitate task execution, a pose estimation model predicts the relative 6D poses of components at each assembly step. At the same time, a motion planning module generates actionable sequences for real-world robotic implementation. We demonstrate the effectiveness of Manual2Skill by successfully assembling several real-world IKEA furniture items. This application highlights its ability to manage long-horizon manipulation tasks with both efficiency and precision, significantly enhancing the practicality of robot learning from instruction manuals. This work marks a step forward in advancing robotic systems capable of understanding and executing complex manipulation tasks in a manner akin to human capabilities.Project Page: https://owensun2004.github.io/Furniture-Assembly-Web/</p></details> |  |

While preference-based learning methods, such as reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF), enable this alignment, the choice of the preference collection interface may influence the process. Traditional 2D interfaces provide structured views but lack spatial depth, whereas immersive VR offers richer perception, potentially affecting preference articulation. This study systematically examines how the interface modality impacts human preference collection and navigation policy alignment. We introduce a novel dataset of 2,325 human preference queries collected through both VR and 2D interfaces, revealing significant differences in user experience, preference consistency, and policy outcomes. Our findings highlight the trade-offs between immersion, perception, and preference reliability, emphasizing the importance of interface selection in preference-based robot learning.

This success offers new promise for robotics, which has long been constrained by the high cost of action-labeled data. We ask: given the abundant video data containing interaction-related knowledge available as a rich "corpus", can a similar generative pre-training approach be effectively applied to enhance robot learning? The key challenge is to identify an effective representation for autoregressive pre-training that benefits robot manipulation tasks. Inspired by the way humans learn new skills through observing dynamic environments, we propose that effective robotic learning should emphasize motion-related knowledge, which is closely tied to low-level actions and is hardware-agnostic, facilitating the transfer of learned motions to actual robot actions. To this end, we introduce Moto, which converts video content into latent Motion Token sequences by a Latent Motion Tokenizer, learning a bridging "language" of motion from videos in an unsupervised manner. We pre-train Moto-GPT through motion token autoregression, enabling it to capture diverse visual motion knowledge. After pre-training, Moto-GPT demonstrates the promising ability to produce semantically interpretable motion tokens, predict plausible motion trajectories, and assess trajectory rationality through output likelihood. To transfer learned motion priors to real robot actions, we implement a co-fine-tuning strategy that seamlessly bridges latent motion token prediction and real robot control. Extensive experiments show that the fine-tuned Moto-GPT exhibits superior robustness and efficiency on robot manipulation benchmarks, underscoring its effectiveness in transferring knowledge from video data to downstream visual manipulation tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICCV ...</summary><p>ICCV 2025.

As its typical physical embodiment, humanoid robots have shown great promise through robot learning algorithms in recent years. In this study, a hardware platform, including humanoid robot and exoskeleton-style teleoperation cabin, was developed to realize intuitive remote manipulation and efficient collection of anthropomorphic action data. To improve the perception representation of humanoid robot, an imitation learning framework, termed Frequency-Enhanced Wavelet-based Transformer (FEWT), was proposed, which consists of two primary modules: Frequency-Enhanced Efficient Multi-Scale Attention (FE-EMA) and Time-Series Discrete Wavelet Transform (TS-DWT). By combining multi-scale wavelet decomposition with the residual network, FE-EMA can dynamically fuse features from both cross-spatial and frequency-domain. This fusion is able to capture feature information across various scales effectively, thereby enhancing model robustness. Experimental performance demonstrates that FEWT improves the success rate of the state-of-the-art algorithm (Action Chunking with Transformers, ACT baseline) by up to 30% in simulation and by 6-12% in real-world.</p></details> |  |
| **[Model-agnostic Adversarial Attack and Defense for Vision-Language-Action Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13237v1)** | 2025-10-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have achieved revolutionary progress in robot learning, enabling robots to execute complex physical robot tasks from natural language instructions. Despite this progress, their adversarial robustness remains underexplored. In this work, we propose both adversarial patch attack and corresponding defense strategies for VLA models. We first introduce the Embedding Disruption Patch Attack (EDPA), a model-agnostic adversarial attack that generates patches directly placeable within the camera's view. In comparison to prior methods, EDPA can be readily applied to different VLA models without requiring prior knowledge of the model architecture, or the controlled robotic manipulator. EDPA constructs these patches by (i) disrupting the semantic alignment between visual and textual latent representations, and (ii) maximizing the discrepancy of latent representations between adversarial and corresponding clean visual inputs. Through the optimization of these objectives, EDPA distorts the VLA's interpretation of visual information, causing the model to repeatedly generate incorrect actions and ultimately result in failure to complete the given robotic task. To counter this, we propose an adversarial fine-tuning scheme for the visual encoder, in which the encoder is optimized to produce similar latent representations for both clean and adversarially perturbed visual inputs. Extensive evaluations on the widely recognized LIBERO robotic simulation benchmark demonstrate that EDPA substantially increases the task failure rate of cutting-edge VLA models, while our proposed defense effectively mitigates this degradation.

This limitation stems not only from a conceptual gap but also from a fundamental computational barrier: prevailing architectures like Transformers are often constrained by quadratic complexity, rendering the processing of long, high-dimensional observation sequences infeasible. To overcome this dual challenge, we introduce Mamba Temporal Imitation Learning (MTIL). Our approach represents a new paradigm for robotic learning, which we frame as a practical synthesis of World Model and Dynamical System concepts. By leveraging the linear-time recurrent dynamics of State Space Models (SSMs), MTIL learns an implicit, action-oriented world model that efficiently encodes the entire trajectory history into a compressed, evolving state. This allows the policy to be conditioned on a comprehensive temporal context, transcending the confines of Markovian approaches. Through extensive experiments on simulated benchmarks (ACT, Robomimic, LIBERO) and on challenging real-world tasks, MTIL demonstrates superior performance against SOTA methods like ACT and Diffusion Policy, particularly in resolving long-term temporal ambiguities. Our findings not only affirm the necessity of full temporal context but also validate MTIL as a powerful and a computationally feasible approach for learning long-horizon, non-Markovian behaviors from high-dimensional observations.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters (RA-L), 2025. 8 pages, 5 figures</p></details> |

Recent GBC methods often employ diffusion policies with open-loop (OL) control, where actions are generated via a diffusion process and executed in multi-step chunks without replanning. While this approach has demonstrated strong success rates and generalization, its inherent stochasticity can result in erroneous action sampling, occasionally leading to unexpected task failures. Moreover, OL control suffers from delayed responses, which can degrade performance in noisy or dynamic environments. To address these limitations, we propose two novel techniques to enhance the consistency and reactivity of diffusion policies: (1) self-guidance, which improves action fidelity by leveraging past observations and implicitly promoting future-aware behavior; and (2) adaptive chunking, which selectively updates action sequences when the benefits of reactivity outweigh the need for temporal consistency. Extensive experiments show that our approach substantially improves GBC performance across a wide range of simulated and real-world robotic manipulation tasks.

While simulated data offers a scalable alternative, it often fails to generalize to the real world due to significant gaps in visual appearance, physical properties, and object interactions. To address this, we propose RoboSimGS, a novel Real2Sim2Real framework that converts multi-view real-world images into scalable, high-fidelity, and physically interactive simulation environments for robotic manipulation. Our approach reconstructs scenes using a hybrid representation: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) captures the photorealistic appearance of the environment, while mesh primitives for interactive objects ensure accurate physics simulation. Crucially, we pioneer the use of a Multi-modal Large Language Model (MLLM) to automate the creation of physically plausible, articulated assets. The MLLM analyzes visual data to infer not only physical properties (e.g., density, stiffness) but also complex kinematic structures (e.g., hinges, sliding rails) of objects. We demonstrate that policies trained entirely on data generated by RoboSimGS achieve successful zero-shot sim-to-real transfer across a diverse set of real-world manipulation tasks.

To facilitate and leverage the heterogeneity in rich, diverse robotic data sources, we propose a novel Soft Prompt approach with minimally added parameters, by infusing prompt learning concepts into cross-embodiment robot learning and introducing separate sets of learnable embeddings for each distinct data source. These embeddings serve as embodiment-specific prompts, which in unity empower VLA models with effective exploitation of varying cross-embodiment features. Our new X-VLA, a neat flow-matching-based VLA architecture, relies exclusively on soft-prompted standard Transformer encoders, enjoying both scalability and simplicity. Evaluated across 6 simulations as well as 3 real-world robots, our 0.9B instantiation-X-VLA-0.9B simultaneously achieves SOTA performance over a sweep of benchmarks, demonstrating superior results on a wide axes of capabilities, from flexible dexterity to quick adaptation across embodiments, environments, and tasks.

Our goal is to understand how structured, human-like attentional behavior emerges through the mutual adaptation of TD and BU mechanisms over time. To this end, we propose a novel attention model $A^3 RNN$ that integrates predictive TD signals and saliency-based BU cues through a bi-directional attention architecture. We evaluate our model in robotic manipulation tasks using imitation learning. Experimental results show that attention behaviors evolve throughout training, from saliency-driven exploration to prediction-driven direction. Initially, BU attention highlights visually salient regions, which guide TD processes, while as learning progresses, TD attention stabilizes and begins to reshape what is perceived as salient. This trajectory reflects principles from cognitive science and the free-energy framework, suggesting the importance of self-organizing attention through interaction between perception and internal prediction. Although not explicitly optimized for stability, our model exhibits more coherent and interpretable attention patterns than baselines, supporting the idea that developmental mechanisms contribute to robust attention formation.</p></details> | 8 pages, 5 figures |
| **[Robot Learning with Super-Linear Scaling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01770v3)** | 2025-10-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Scaling robot learning requires data collection pipelines that scale favorably with human effort. In this work, we propose Crowdsourcing and Amortizing Human Effort for Real-to-Sim-to-Real(CASHER), a pipeline for scaling up data collection and learning in simulation where the performance scales superlinearly with human effort. The key idea is to crowdsource digital twins of real-world scenes using 3D reconstruction and collect large-scale data in simulation, rather than the real-world. Data collection in simulation is initially driven by RL, bootstrapped with human demonstrations. As the training of a generalist policy progresses across environments, its generalization capabilities can be used to replace human effort with model generated demonstrations. This results in a pipeline where behavioral data is collected in simulation with continually reducing human effort. We show that CASHER demonstrates zero-shot and few-shot scaling laws on three real-world tasks across diverse scenarios. We show that CASHER enables fine-tuning of pre-trained policies to a target scenario using a video scan without any additional human effort.

| **[When a Robot is More Capable than a Human: Learning from Constrained Demonstrators](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09096v1)** | 2025-10-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Learning from demonstrations enables experts to teach robots complex tasks using interfaces such as kinesthetic teaching, joystick control, and sim-to-real transfer. However, these interfaces often constrain the expert's ability to demonstrate optimal behavior due to indirect control, setup restrictions, and hardware safety. For example, a joystick can move a robotic arm only in a 2D plane, even though the robot operates in a higher-dimensional space. As a result, the demonstrations collected by constrained experts lead to suboptimal performance of the learned policies. This raises a key question: Can a robot learn a better policy than the one demonstrated by a constrained expert? We address this by allowing the agent to go beyond direct imitation of expert actions and explore shorter and more efficient trajectories. We use the demonstrations to infer a state-only reward signal that measures task progress, and self-label reward for unknown states using temporal interpolation. Our approach outperforms common imitation learning in both sample efficiency and task completion time. On a real WidowX robotic arm, it completes the task in 12 seconds, 10x faster than behavioral cloning, as shown in real-robot videos on https://sites.google.com/view/constrainedexpert .</p></details> |  |

However, the majority of current robot learning datasets and benchmarks mainly focus on stationary robot arms, and the few existing humanoid datasets are either confined to fixed environments or limited in task diversity, often lacking human-humanoid interaction and lower-body locomotion. Moreover, there are a few standardized evaluation platforms for benchmarking learning-based policies on humanoid data. In this work, we present Humanoid Everyday, a large-scale and diverse humanoid manipulation dataset characterized by extensive task variety involving dextrous object manipulation, human-humanoid interaction, locomotion-integrated actions, and more. Leveraging a highly efficient human-supervised teleoperation pipeline, Humanoid Everyday aggregates high-quality multimodal sensory data, including RGB, depth, LiDAR, and tactile inputs, together with natural language annotations, comprising 10.3k trajectories and over 3 million frames of data across 260 tasks across 7 broad categories. In addition, we conduct an analysis of representative policy learning methods on our dataset, providing insights into their strengths and limitations across different task categories. For standardized evaluation, we introduce a cloud-based evaluation platform that allows researchers to seamlessly deploy their policies in our controlled setting and receive performance feedback. By releasing Humanoid Everyday along with our policy learning analysis and a standardized cloud-based evaluation platform, we intend to advance research in general-purpose humanoid manipulation and lay the groundwork for more capable and embodied robotic agents in real-world scenarios. Our dataset, data collection code, and cloud evaluation website are made publicly available on our project website.</p></details> |  |

While prior work has explored handheld paradigms, their rod-based mechanical structures remain rigid and unintuitive, providing limited tactile feedback and posing challenges for human operators. Motivated by the dexterity and force feedback of human motion, we propose FreeTacMan, a human-centric and robot-free data collection system for accurate and efficient robot manipulation. Concretely, we design a wearable gripper with dual visuo-tactile sensors for data collection, which can be worn by human fingers for intuitive control. A high-precision optical tracking system is introduced to capture end-effector poses while synchronizing visual and tactile feedback simultaneously. We leverage FreeTacMan to collect a large-scale multimodal dataset, comprising over 3000k paired visual-tactile images with end-effector poses, 10k demonstration trajectories across 50 diverse contact-rich manipulation tasks. FreeTacMan achieves multiple improvements in data collection performance compared to prior works, and enables effective policy learning for contact-rich manipulation tasks with self-collected dataset. The full suite of hardware specifications and the dataset will be released to facilitate reproducibility and support research in visuo-tactile manipulation.</p></details> |  |

Existing methods relying on text-only instructions often struggle to generalize to unseen scenarios. We argue that interleaved image-text inputs offer richer and less biased context and enable robots to better handle unseen tasks with more versatile human-robot interaction. Building on this insight, Interleave-VLA, the first robot learning paradigm capable of comprehending interleaved image-text instructions and directly generating continuous action sequences in the physical world, is introduced. It offers a natural, flexible, and model-agnostic paradigm that extends state-of-the-art vision-language-action (VLA) models with minimal modifications while achieving strong zero-shot generalization. Interleave-VLA also includes an automatic pipeline that converts text instructions from Open X-Embodiment into interleaved image-text instructions, resulting in a large-scale real-world interleaved embodied dataset with 210k episodes. Comprehensive evaluation in simulation and the real world shows that Interleave-VLA offers two major benefits: (1) improves out-of-domain generalization to unseen objects by 2x compared to text input baselines, (2) supports flexible task interfaces and diverse instructions in a zero-shot manner, such as hand-drawn sketches. We attribute Interleave-VLA's strong zero-shot capability to the use of instruction images, which effectively mitigate hallucinations, and the inclusion of heterogeneous multimodal datasets, enriched with Internet-sourced images, offering potential for scalability.

To complete many common tasks, relevant objects are required to pass in and out of a robot's field of view. In these settings, spatial memory - the ability to remember the spatial composition of the scene - is an important competency. However, building such mechanisms into robot learning systems remains an open research problem. We introduce mindmap (Spatial Memory in Deep Feature Maps for 3D Action Policies), a 3D diffusion policy that generates robot trajectories based on a semantic 3D reconstruction of the environment. We show in simulation experiments that our approach is effective at solving tasks where state-of-the-art approaches without memory mechanisms struggle.

Distilling multiple VFMs into a unified representation for policy can mitigate this limitation but often yields inflexible task-specific feature selection and requires costly full re-training to incorporate robot-domain knowledge. We propose VER, a Vision Expert transformer for Robot learning. During pretraining, VER distills multiple VFMs into a vision expert library. It then fine-tunes only a lightweight routing network (fewer than 0.4% of parameters) to dynamically select task-relevant experts from the pretrained library for downstream robot tasks. We further introduce Patchwise Expert Routing with Curriculum Top-K Annealing to improve both flexibility and precision of dynamic expert selection. Moreover, VER supports parameter-efficient finetuning for scalable expert utilization and adaptive robot-domain knowledge integration. Across 17 diverse robotic tasks and multiple policy heads, VER achieves state-of-the-art performance. We find that VER reduces large-norm outliers in task-irrelevant regions (e.g., background) and concentrates on task-critical regions. Visualizations and codes can be found in https://yixiaowang7.github.io/ver_page/.</p></details> |  |
| **[Learning to Play Piano in the Real World](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15481v2)** | 2025-10-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Towards the grand challenge of achieving human-level manipulation in robots, playing piano is a compelling testbed that requires strategic, precise, and flowing movements. Over the years, several works demonstrated hand-designed controllers on real world piano playing, while other works evaluated robot learning approaches on simulated piano scenarios. In this paper, we develop the first piano playing robotic system that makes use of learning approaches while also being deployed on a real world dexterous robot. Specifically, we make use of Sim2Real to train a policy in simulation using reinforcement learning before deploying the learned policy on a real world dexterous robot. In our experiments, we thoroughly evaluate the interplay between domain randomization and the accuracy of the dynamics model used in simulation. Moreover, we evaluate the robot's performance across multiple songs with varying complexity to study the generalization of our learned policy. By providing a proof-of-concept of learning to play piano in the real world, we want to encourage the community to adopt piano playing as a compelling benchmark towards human-level manipulation. We open-source our code and show additional videos at https://lasr.org/research/learning-to-play-piano .</p></details> |  |

However, learning solely from robot demonstrations is labor-intensive, requiring expensive tele-operated data collection which is difficult to scale. This paper investigates a more scalable data source, egocentric human demonstrations, to serve as cross-embodiment training data for robot learning. We mitigate the embodiment gap between humanoids and humans from both the data and modeling perspectives. We collect an egocentric task-oriented dataset (PH2D) that is directly aligned with humanoid manipulation demonstrations. We then train a human-humanoid behavior policy, which we term Human Action Transformer (HAT). The state-action space of HAT is unified for both humans and humanoid robots and can be differentiably retargeted to robot actions. Co-trained with smaller-scale robot data, HAT directly models humanoid robots and humans as different embodiments without additional supervision. We show that human data improves both generalization and robustness of HAT with significantly better data collection efficiency.

However, the scarcity of diverse, high-quality datasets continues to hinder video-conditioned robotic learning, limiting cross-platform generalization. In this work, we address the challenge of swapping a robotic arm in one video with another: a key step for crossembodiment learning. Unlike previous methods that depend on paired video demonstrations in the same environmental settings, our proposed framework, RoboSwap, operates on unpaired data from diverse environments, alleviating the data collection needs. RoboSwap introduces a novel video editing pipeline integrating both GANs and diffusion models, combining their isolated advantages. Specifically, we segment robotic arms from their backgrounds and train an unpaired GAN model to translate one robotic arm to another. The translated arm is blended with the original video background and refined with a diffusion model to enhance coherence, motion realism and object interaction. The GAN and diffusion stages are trained independently. Our experiments demonstrate that RoboSwap outperforms state-of-the-art video and image editing models on three benchmarks in terms of both structural coherence and motion consistency, thereby offering a robust solution for generating reliable, cross-embodiment data in robotic learning.</p></details> |  |

Instead of designing different policies for different tasks, our approach unifies the definition of a task through a sequence of contact goals-desired contact positions, timings, and active end-effectors. This enables leveraging the shared structure across diverse contact-rich tasks, leading to a single policy that can perform a wide range of tasks. In particular, we train a goal-conditioned reinforcement learning (RL) policy to realise given contact plans. We validate our framework on multiple robotic embodiments and tasks: a quadruped performing multiple gaits, a humanoid performing multiple biped and quadrupedal gaits, and a humanoid executing different bimanual object manipulation tasks. Each of these scenarios is controlled by a single policy trained to execute different tasks grounded in contacts, demonstrating versatile and robust behaviours across morphologically distinct systems. Our results show that explicit contact reasoning significantly improves generalisation to unseen scenarios, positioning contact-explicit policy learning as a promising foundation for scalable loco-manipulation.</p></details> |  |

We present the first method that enables robots to autonomously invent symbolic, relational concepts directly from a small number of raw, unsegmented, and unannotated demonstrations. From these, the robot learns logic-based world models that support zero-shot generalization to tasks of far greater complexity than those in training. Our framework achieves performance on par with hand-engineered symbolic models, while scaling to execution horizons far beyond training and handling up to 18$\times$ more objects than seen during learning. The results demonstrate a framework for autonomously acquiring transferable symbolic abstractions from raw robot experience, contributing toward the development of interpretable, scalable, and generalizable robot planning systems.

In particular, diverse action spaces across different end-effectors create barriers for cross-embodiment learning and skill transfer. We address this challenge through diffusion policies learned in a latent action space that unifies diverse end-effector actions. We first show that we can learn a semantically aligned latent action space for anthropomorphic robotic hands, a human hand, and a parallel jaw gripper using encoders trained with a contrastive loss. Second, we show that by using our proposed latent action space for co-training on manipulation data from different end-effectors, we can utilize a single policy for multi-robot control and obtain up to 25.3% improved manipulation success rates, indicating successful skill transfer despite a significant embodiment gap. Our approach using latent cross-embodiment policies presents a new method to unify different action spaces across embodiments, enabling efficient multi-robot control and data sharing across robot setups. This unified representation significantly reduces the need for extensive data collection for each new robot morphology, accelerates generalization across embodiments, and ultimately facilitates more scalable and efficient robotic learning.</p></details> | <details><summary>15 pa...</summary><p>15 pages, 7 figures, website: https://mimicrobotics.github.io/lad/</p></details> |

Existing keypoint-based approaches can focus on manipulation-centric features and be lightweight, but either depend on manual heuristics or task-coupled selection, limiting scalability and semantic understanding. To address this, we propose AFFORD2ACT, an affordance-guided framework that distills a minimal set of semantic 2D keypoints from a text prompt and a single image. AFFORD2ACT follows a three-stage pipeline: affordance filtering, category-level keypoint construction, and transformer-based policy learning with embedded gating to reason about the most relevant keypoints, yielding a compact 38-dimensional state policy that can be trained in 15 minutes, which performs well in real-time without proprioception or dense representations. Across diverse real-world manipulation tasks, AFFORD2ACT consistently improves data efficiency, achieving an 82% success rate on unseen objects, novel categories, backgrounds, and distractors.</p></details> |  |

However, existing robot learning algorithms, especially learn-from-demonstration methods, still struggle to handle diverse and dynamic food states, which often results in spillage and reduced reliability. In this work, we introduce GRITS: A Spillage-Aware Guided Diffusion Policy for Robot Food Scooping Tasks. This framework leverages guided diffusion policy to minimize food spillage during scooping and to ensure reliable transfer of food items from the initial to the target location. Specifically, we design a spillage predictor that estimates the probability of spillage given current observation and action rollout. The predictor is trained on a simulated dataset with food spillage scenarios, constructed from four primitive shapes (spheres, cubes, cones, and cylinders) with varied physical properties such as mass, friction, and particle size. At inference time, the predictor serves as a differentiable guidance signal, steering the diffusion sampling process toward safer trajectories while preserving task success. We validate GRITS on a real-world robotic food scooping platform. GRITS is trained on six food categories and evaluated on ten unseen categories with different shapes and quantities. GRITS achieves an 82% task success rate and a 4% spillage rate, reducing spillage by over 40% compared to baselines without guidance, thereby demonstrating its effectiveness.</p></details> |  |

While considerable research has focused on improving training stability and data sampling efficiency, most deployment strategies have remained relatively simplistic, typically relying on direct actor policy rollouts. In contrast, we propose \pachs{} (\textit{P}arallel \textit{A}ctor-\textit{C}ritic \textit{H}euristic \textit{S}earch), an efficient parallel best-first search algorithm for inference that leverages both components of the actor-critic architecture: the actor network generates actions, while the critic network provides cost-to-go estimates to guide the search. Two levels of parallelism are employed within the search -- actions and cost-to-go estimates are generated in batches by the actor and critic networks respectively, and graph expansion is distributed across multiple threads. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in robotic manipulation tasks, including collision-free motion planning and contact-rich interactions such as non-prehensile pushing.

Over the years, powerful tools like the Open Motion Planning Library (OMPL) have been developed, offering numerous motion planning algorithms.

Deploying LLMs/VLMs for motion planning, however, faces two key obstacles: (i) symbolic plans are rarely grounded in scene geometry and object physics, and (ii) model outputs can vary for identical prompts, undermining execution reliability. We propose ViReSkill, a framework that pairs vision-grounded replanning with a skill memory for accumulation and reuse. When a failure occurs, the replanner generates a new action sequence conditioned on the current scene, tailored to the observed state. On success, the executed plan is stored as a reusable skill and replayed in future encounters without additional calls to LLMs/VLMs. This feedback loop enables autonomous continual learning: each attempt immediately expands the skill set and stabilizes subsequent executions. We evaluate ViReSkill on simulators such as LIBERO and RLBench as well as on a physical robot. Across all settings, it consistently outperforms conventional baselines in task success rate, demonstrating robust sim-to-real generalization.</p></details> |  |

Recently, passive observation using extended reality (XR) headsets has shown promise for egocentric demonstration collection, yet current approaches require additional hardware, complex calibration, or constrained recording conditions that limit scalability and usability. We present ARMimic, a novel framework that overcomes these limitations with a lightweight and hardware-minimal setup for scalable, robot-free data collection using only a consumer XR headset and a stationary workplace camera. ARMimic integrates egocentric hand tracking, augmented reality (AR) robot overlays, and real-time depth sensing to ensure collision-aware, kinematically feasible demonstrations. A unified imitation learning pipeline is at the core of our method, treating both human and virtual robot trajectories as interchangeable, which enables policies that generalize across different embodiments and environments. We validate ARMimic on two manipulation tasks, including challenging long-horizon bowl stacking. In our experiments, ARMimic reduces demonstration time by 50% compared to teleoperation and improves task success by 11% over ACT, a state-of-the-art baseline trained on teleoperated data. Our results demonstrate that ARMimic enables safe, seamless, and in-the-wild data collection, offering great potential for scalable robot learning in diverse real-world settings.</p></details> |  |

In DAWN, both the high-level and low-level controllers are modeled as diffusion processes, yielding a fully trainable, end-to-end system with interpretable intermediate motion abstractions. DAWN achieves state-of-the-art results on the challenging CALVIN benchmark, demonstrating strong multi-task performance, and further validates its effectiveness on MetaWorld. Despite the substantial domain gap between simulation and reality and limited real-world data, we demonstrate reliable real-world transfer with only minimal finetuning, illustrating the practical viability of diffusion-based motion abstractions for robotic control. Our results show the effectiveness of combining diffusion modeling with motion-centric representations as a strong baseline for scalable and robust robot learning.

| **[Mobi-$π$: Mobilizing Your Robot Learning Policy](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23692v2)** | 2025-09-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Learned visuomotor policies are capable of performing increasingly complex manipulation tasks. However, most of these policies are trained on data collected from limited robot positions and camera viewpoints. This leads to poor generalization to novel robot positions, which limits the use of these policies on mobile platforms, especially for precise tasks like pressing buttons or turning faucets. In this work, we formulate the policy mobilization problem: find a mobile robot base pose in a novel environment that is in distribution with respect to a manipulation policy trained on a limited set of camera viewpoints. Compared to retraining the policy itself to be more robust to unseen robot base pose initializations, policy mobilization decouples navigation from manipulation and thus does not require additional demonstrations. Crucially, this problem formulation complements existing efforts to improve manipulation policy robustness to novel viewpoints and remains compatible with them. We propose a novel approach for policy mobilization that bridges navigation and manipulation by optimizing the robot's base pose to align with an in-distribution base pose for a learned policy. Our approach utilizes 3D Gaussian Splatting for novel view synthesis, a score function to evaluate pose suitability, and sampling-based optimization to identify optimal robot poses. To understand policy mobilization in more depth, we also introduce the Mobi-$π$ framework, which includes: (1) metrics that quantify the difficulty of mobilizing a given policy, (2) a suite of simulated mobile manipulation tasks based on RoboCasa to evaluate policy mobilization, and (3) visualization tools for analysis. In both our developed simulation task suite and the real world, we show that our approach outperforms baselines, demonstrating its effectiveness for policy mobilization.</p></details> | <details><summary>CoRL ...</summary><p>CoRL 2025.

Existing human-in-the-loop reinforcement learning (HiL-RL) methods often assume abundant feedback, limiting their practicality for physical robot deployment. In this work, we introduce SPARQ, a progress-aware query policy that requests feedback only when learning stagnates or worsens, thereby reducing unnecessary oracle calls. We evaluate SPARQ on a simulated UR5 cube-picking task in PyBullet, comparing against three baselines: no feedback, random querying, and always querying. Our experiments show that SPARQ achieves near-perfect task success, matching the performance of always querying while consuming about half the feedback budget. It also provides more stable and efficient learning than random querying, and significantly improves over training without feedback. These findings suggest that selective, progress-based query strategies can make HiL-RL more efficient and scalable for robots operating under realistic human effort constraints.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint. 8 pages, 3 figures, 1 table, 1 algorithm.

Existing work has applied VLMs to generate task and motion planning from natural language instructions and simulate training data for robot learning. In this work, we explore using VLM to interpret human demonstration videos and generate robot task planning. Our method integrates keyframe selection, visual perception, and VLM reasoning into a pipeline. We named it SeeDo because it enables the VLM to ''see'' human demonstrations and explain the corresponding plans to the robot for it to ''do''. To validate our approach, we collected a set of long-horizon human videos demonstrating pick-and-place tasks in three diverse categories and designed a set of metrics to comprehensively benchmark SeeDo against several baselines, including state-of-the-art video-input VLMs. The experiments demonstrate SeeDo's superior performance. We further deployed the generated task plans in both a simulation environment and on a real robot arm.</p></details> |  |
| **[Score the Steps, Not Just the Goal: VLM-Based Subgoal Evaluation for Robotic Manipulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19524v1)** | 2025-09-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Robot learning papers typically report a single binary success rate (SR), which obscures where a policy succeeds or fails along a multi-step manipulation task. We argue that subgoal-level reporting should become routine: for each trajectory, a vector of per-subgoal SRs that makes partial competence visible (e.g., grasp vs. pour). We propose a blueprint for StepEval, a cost-aware plug-in evaluation framework that utilizes vision-language models (VLMs) as automated judges of subgoal outcomes from recorded images or videos. Rather than proposing new benchmarks or APIs, our contribution is to outline design principles for a scalable, community-driven open-source project. In StepEval, the primary artifact for policy evaluation is the per-subgoal SR vector; however, other quantities (e.g., latency or cost estimates) are also considered for framework-optimization diagnostics to help the community tune evaluation efficiency and accuracy when ground-truth subgoal success labels are available. We discuss how such a framework can remain model-agnostic, support single- or multi-view inputs, and be lightweight enough to adopt across labs. The intended contribution is a shared direction: a minimal, extensible seed that invites open-source contributions, so that scoring the steps, not just the final goal, becomes a standard and reproducible practice.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to the CoRL 2025 Eval&Deploy Workshop</p></details> |
| **[Dynamic Mixture of Progressive Parameter-Efficient Expert Library for Lifelong Robot Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05985v2)** | 2025-09-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A generalist agent must continuously learn and adapt throughout its lifetime, achieving efficient forward transfer while minimizing catastrophic forgetting. Previous work within the dominant pretrain-then-finetune paradigm has explored parameter-efficient fine-tuning for single-task adaptation, effectively steering a frozen pretrained model with a small number of parameters. However, in the context of lifelong learning, these methods rely on the impractical assumption of a test-time task identifier and restrict knowledge sharing among isolated adapters. To address these limitations, we propose Dynamic Mixture of Progressive Parameter-Efficient Expert Library (DMPEL) for lifelong robot learning. DMPEL progressively builds a low-rank expert library and employs a lightweight router to dynamically combine experts into an end-to-end policy, enabling flexible and efficient lifelong forward transfer. Furthermore, by leveraging the modular structure of the fine-tuned parameters, we introduce expert coefficient replay, which guides the router to accurately retrieve frozen experts for previously encountered tasks. This technique mitigates forgetting while being significantly more storage- and computation-efficient than experience replay over the entire policy. Extensive experiments on the lifelong robot learning benchmark LIBERO demonstrate that our framework outperforms state-of-the-art lifelong learning methods in success rates during continual adaptation, while utilizing minimal trainable parameters and storage.</p></details> |  |
| **[RoboSeek: You Need to Interact with Your Objects](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17783v2)** | 2025-09-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Optimizing and refining action execution through exploration and interaction is a promising way for robotic manipulation. However, practical approaches to interaction-driven robotic learning are still underexplored, particularly for long-horizon tasks where sequential decision-making, physical constraints, and perceptual uncertainties pose significant challenges. Motivated by embodied cognition theory, we propose RoboSeek, a framework for embodied action execution that leverages interactive experience to accomplish manipulation tasks. RoboSeek optimizes prior knowledge from high-level perception models through closed-loop training in simulation and achieves robust real-world execution via a real2sim2real transfer pipeline. Specifically, we first replicate real-world environments in simulation using 3D reconstruction to provide visually and physically consistent environments, then we train policies in simulation using reinforcement learning and the cross-entropy method leveraging visual priors. The learned policies are subsequently deployed on real robotic platforms for execution. RoboSeek is hardware-agnostic and is evaluated on multiple robotic platforms across eight long-horizon manipulation tasks involving sequential interactions, tool use, and object handling. Our approach achieves an average success rate of 79%, significantly outperforming baselines whose success rates remain below 50%, highlighting its generalization and robustness across tasks and platforms. Experimental results validate the effectiveness of our training framework in complex, dynamic real-world settings and demonstrate the stability of the proposed real2sim2real transfer mechanism, paving the way for more generalizable embodied robotic learning.

| **[Look, Focus, Act: Efficient and Robust Robot Learning via Human Gaze and Foveated Vision Transformers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15833v2)** | 2025-09-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Human vision is a highly active process driven by gaze, which directs attention to task-relevant regions through foveation, dramatically reducing visual processing. In contrast, robot learning systems typically rely on passive, uniform processing of raw camera images. In this work, we explore how incorporating human-like active gaze into robotic policies can enhance efficiency and robustness. We develop GIAVA (Gaze Integrated Active-Vision ALOHA), a robot vision system that emulates human head and neck movement, and gaze adjustment for foveated processing. Extending the AV-ALOHA robot platform, we introduce a framework for simultaneously collecting eye-tracking, perspective control, and robot manipulation demonstration data from a human operator. We also open-source a simulation benchmark and dataset for training robot policies that incorporate human gaze. Inspired by recent work in foveated image segmentation and given the widespread use of Vision Transformers (ViTs) in robot learning, we integrate gaze information into ViTs using a foveated patch tokenization scheme. Compared to uniform patch tokenization, this significantly reduces the number of tokens, and thus computation. Our results show that our method for foveated robot vision drastically reduces computational overhead, and enhances robustness to background distractors. Notably, on certain high-precision tasks, foveated vision also improves performance, as reflected in higher success rates. Together, these findings suggest that human-inspired foveated visual processing offers untapped potential and should be further considered as a useful inductive bias in robotic vision systems. https://ian-chuang.github.io/gaze-av-aloha/</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://ian-chuang.github.io/gaze-av-aloha/</p></details> |

Training robotic manipulation policies on these datasets is traditionally performed in a centralized manner, raising concerns regarding scalability, adaptability, and data privacy. While federated learning enables decentralized, privacy-preserving training, its application to robotic manipulation remains largely unexplored. We introduce FLAME (Federated Learning Across Manipulation Environments), the first benchmark designed for federated learning in robotic manipulation. FLAME consists of: (i) a set of large-scale datasets of over 160,000 expert demonstrations of multiple manipulation tasks, collected across a wide range of simulated environments; (ii) a training and evaluation framework for robotic policy learning in a federated setting. We evaluate standard federated learning algorithms in FLAME, showing their potential for distributed policy learning and highlighting key challenges. Our benchmark establishes a foundation for scalable, adaptive, and privacy-aware robotic learning.</p></details> | Under Review |
| **[Dexterous Grasping with Real-World Robotic Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04014v2)** | 2025-09-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Dexterous grasping in the real world presents a fundamental and significant challenge for robot learning. The ability to employ affordance-aware poses to grasp objects with diverse geometries and properties in arbitrary scenarios is essential for general-purpose robots. However, existing research predominantly addresses dexterous grasping problems within simulators, which encounter difficulties when applied in real-world environments due to the domain gap between reality and simulation. This limitation hinders their generalizability and practicality in real-world applications. In this paper, we present DexGraspRL, a reinforcement learning (RL) framework that directly trains robots in real-world environments to acquire dexterous grasping skills. Specifically, DexGraspRL consists of two stages: (i) a pretraining stage that pretrains the policy using imitation learning (IL) with a limited set of expert demonstrations; (ii) a fine-tuning stage that refines the policy through direct RL in real-world scenarios. To mitigate the catastrophic forgetting phenomenon arising from the distribution shift between demonstrations and real-world environments, we design a regularization term that balances the exploitation of RL with the preservation of the pretrained policy. Our experiments with real-world tasks demonstrate that DexGraspRL successfully accomplishes diverse dexterous grasping tasks, achieving an average success rate of nearly 92%. Furthermore, by fine-tuning with RL, our method uncovers novel policies, surpassing the IL policy with a 23% reduction in average cycle time.</p></details> |  |
| **[Robot Learning with Sparsity and Scarcity](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16834v1)** | 2025-09-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Unlike in language or vision, one of the fundamental challenges in robot learning is the lack of access to vast data resources. We can further break down the problem into (1) data sparsity from the angle of data representation and (2) data scarcity from the angle of data quantity. In this thesis, I will discuss selected works on two domains: (1) tactile sensing and (2) rehabilitation robots, which are exemplars of data sparsity and scarcity, respectively. Tactile sensing is an essential modality for robotics, but tactile data are often sparse, and for each interaction with the physical world, tactile sensors can only obtain information about the local area of contact. I will discuss my work on learning vision-free tactile-only exploration and manipulation policies through model-free reinforcement learning to make efficient use of sparse tactile information. On the other hand, rehabilitation robots are an example of data scarcity to the extreme due to the significant challenge of collecting biosignals from disabled-bodied subjects at scale for training. I will discuss my work in collaboration with the medical school and clinicians on intent inferral for stroke survivors, where a hand orthosis developed in our lab collects a set of biosignals from the patient and uses them to infer the activity that the patient intends to perform, so the orthosis can provide the right type of physical assistance at the right moment. My work develops machine learning algorithms that enable intent inferral with minimal data, including semi-supervised, meta-learning, and generative AI methods.</p></details> |  |

Standard reinforcement learning (RL) and imitation learning methods require expert supervision through human-designed reward functions or demonstrations for every new task. In contrast, ReWiND starts from a small demonstration dataset to learn: (1) a data-efficient, language-conditioned reward function that labels the dataset with rewards, and (2) a language-conditioned policy pre-trained with offline RL using these rewards. Given an unseen task variation, ReWiND fine-tunes the pre-trained policy using the learned reward function, requiring minimal online interaction. We show that ReWiND's reward model generalizes effectively to unseen tasks, outperforming baselines by up to 2.4x in reward generalization and policy alignment metrics. Finally, we demonstrate that ReWiND enables sample-efficient adaptation to new tasks, beating baselines by 2x in simulation and improving real-world pretrained bimanual policies by 5x, taking a step towards scalable, real-world robot learning.

This requires robots with intelligent interaction abilities to work naturally and effectively with humans. However, current robotic simulators fail to support real human participation, limiting their ability to provide authentic interaction experiences and gather valuable human feedback essential for enhancing robotic capabilities. In this paper, we introduce SymBridge, the first human-in-the-loop cyber-physical interactive system designed to enable the safe and efficient development, evaluation, and optimization of human-robot interaction methods. Specifically, we employ augmented reality technology to enable real humans to interact with virtual robots in physical environments, creating an authentic interactive experience. Building on this, we propose a novel robotic interaction model that generates responsive, precise robot actions in real time through continuous human behavior observation. The model incorporates multi-resolution human motion features and environmental affordances, ensuring contextually adaptive robotic responses. Additionally, SymBridge enables continuous robot learning by collecting human feedback and dynamically adapting the robotic interaction model. By leveraging a carefully designed system architecture and modules, SymBridge builds a bridge between humans and robots, as well as between cyber and physical spaces, providing a natural and realistic online interaction experience while facilitating the continuous evolution of robotic intelligence. Extensive experiments, user studies, and real robot testing demonstrate the promising performance of the system and highlight its potential to significantly advance research on human-robot symbiosis.</p></details> |  |

They replace specialized architectures and task-tailored components of expert policies with large-scale data collection and setup-specific fine-tuning. In this machine learning-focused workflow that is centered around models and scalable training, traditional robotics software frameworks become a bottleneck, while robot simulations offer only limited support for transitioning from and to real-world experiments. In this work, we close this gap by introducing Robot Control Stack (RCS), a lean ecosystem designed from the ground up to support research in robot learning with large-scale generalist policies. At its core, RCS features a modular and easily extensible layered architecture with a unified interface for simulated and physical robots, facilitating sim-to-real transfer. Despite its minimal footprint and dependencies, it offers a complete feature set, enabling both real-world experiments and large-scale training in simulation. Our contribution is twofold: First, we introduce the architecture of RCS and explain its design principles. Second, we evaluate its usability and performance along the development cycle of VLA and RL policies. Our experiments also provide an extensive evaluation of Octo, OpenVLA, and Pi Zero on multiple robots and shed light on how simulation data can improve real-world policy performance.

A key reason is that networks must relearn fundamental spatial concepts, such as translations and rotations, from scratch for every new task. To alleviate this redundancy, we propose embedding geometric inductive biases directly into the network architecture using Projective Geometric Algebra (PGA). PGA provides a unified algebraic framework for representing geometric primitives and transformations, allowing neural networks to reason about spatial structure more effectively. In this paper, we introduce hPGA-DP, a novel hybrid diffusion policy that capitalizes on these benefits. Our architecture leverages the Projective Geometric Algebra Transformer (P-GATr) as a state encoder and action decoder, while employing established U-Net or Transformer-based modules for the core denoising process. Through extensive experiments and ablation studies in both simulated and real-world environments, we demonstrate that hPGA-DP significantly improves task performance and training efficiency. Notably, our hybrid approach achieves substantially faster convergence compared to both standard diffusion policies and architectures that rely solely on P-GATr.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we investigate how tactile sensing can help bridge differences between robotic embodiments in the context of collaborative manipulation. For a robot, learning and executing force-rich collaboration require compliance to human interaction. While compliance is often achieved with admittance control, many commercial robots lack the joint torque monitoring needed for such control. To address this challenge, we present an approach that uses tactile sensors and behavior cloning to transfer policies from robots with these capabilities to those without. We train a single policy that demonstrates positive transfer across embodiments, including robots without torque sensing. We demonstrate this positive transfer on four different tactile-enabled embodiments using the same policy trained on force-controlled robot data. Across multiple proposed metrics, the best performance came from a decomposed tactile shear-field representation combined with a pre-trained encoder, which improved success rates over alternative representations.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages including references, 8 figures, 2 tables, submitted to ICRA 2026</p></details> |

The typical approach, where a policy and vision encoder are trained jointly from scratch, generalizes poorly to novel visual scene changes. Using pre-trained vision models (PVMs) to inform a policy network improves robustness in model-free reinforcement learning (MFRL). Recent developments in Model-based reinforcement learning (MBRL) suggest that MBRL is more sample-efficient than MFRL. However, counterintuitively, existing work has found PVMs to be ineffective in MBRL. Here, we investigate PVM's effectiveness in MBRL, specifically on generalization under visual domain shifts. We show that, in scenarios with severe shifts, PVMs perform much better than a baseline model trained from scratch. We further investigate the effects of varying levels of fine-tuning of PVMs. Our results show that partial fine-tuning can maintain the highest average task performance under the most extreme distribution shifts. Our results demonstrate that PVMs are highly successful in promoting robustness in visual policy learning, providing compelling evidence for their wider adoption in model-based robotic learning applications.</p></details> |  |

Motivated by this principle, we introduce EyeRobot, a robotic system with gaze behavior that emerges from the need to complete real-world tasks. We develop a mechanical eyeball that can freely rotate to observe its surroundings and train a gaze policy to control it using reinforcement learning. We accomplish this by first collecting teleoperated demonstrations paired with a 360 camera. This data is imported into a simulation environment that supports rendering arbitrary eyeball viewpoints, allowing episode rollouts of eye gaze on top of robot demonstrations. We then introduce a BC-RL loop to train the hand and eye jointly: the hand (BC) agent is trained from rendered eye observations, and the eye (RL) agent is rewarded when the hand produces correct action predictions. In this way, hand-eye coordination emerges as the eye looks towards regions which allow the hand to complete the task. EyeRobot implements a foveal-inspired policy architecture allowing high resolution with a small compute budget, which we find also leads to the emergence of more stable fixation as well as improved ability to track objects and ignore distractors. We evaluate EyeRobot on five panoramic workspace manipulation tasks requiring manipulation in an arc surrounding the robot arm. Our experiments suggest EyeRobot exhibits hand-eye coordination behaviors which effectively facilitate manipulation over large workspaces with a single camera.

While recent studies have proposed diverse hardware pipelines-ranging from inertial motion-capture gloves to exoskeletons and vision-based interfaces-there is still no unified benchmark that enables fair, reproducible comparison of these systems. In this paper, we introduce TeleOpBench, a simulator-centric benchmark tailored to bimanual dexterous teleoperation. TeleOpBench contains 30 high-fidelity task environments that span pick-and-place, tool use, and collaborative manipulation, covering a broad spectrum of kinematic and force-interaction difficulty. Within this benchmark we implement four representative teleoperation modalities-(i) MoCap, (ii) VR device, (iii) arm-hand exoskeletons, and (iv) monocular vision tracking-and evaluate them with a common protocol and metric suite. To validate that performance in simulation is predictive of real-world behavior, we conduct mirrored experiments on a physical dual-arm platform equipped with two 6-DoF dexterous hands. Across 10 held-out tasks we observe a strong correlation between simulator and hardware performance, confirming the external validity of TeleOpBench. TeleOpBench establishes a common yardstick for teleoperation research and provides an extensible platform for future algorithmic and hardware innovation.

While teleoperation is widely used, it is slow, delay-sensitive, and poorly suited for dynamic tasks. In contrast, human videos provide a natural way for data collection without specialized hardware, though they pose challenges on robot learning due to viewpoint variations and embodiment gaps. To address these challenges, we propose a framework that transfers tool-use knowledge from humans to robots. To improve the policy's robustness to viewpoint variations, we use two RGB cameras to reconstruct 3D scenes and apply Gaussian splatting for novel view synthesis. We reduce the embodiment gap using segmented observations and tool-centric, task-space actions to achieve embodiment-invariant visuomotor policy learning. We demonstrate our framework's effectiveness across a diverse suite of tool-use tasks, where our learned policy shows strong generalization and robustness to human perturbations, camera motion, and robot base movement. Our method achieves a 71\% improvement in task success over teleoperation-based diffusion policies and dramatically reduces data collection time by 77\% and 41\% compared to teleoperation and the state-of-the-art interface, respectively.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to CoRL 2025.

However, continually learning new tasks would introduce catastrophic forgetting problems due to data distribution shifts. To mitigate this, we store a subset of data from previous tasks and utilize it in two manners: leveraging experience replay to retain learned skills and applying a novel Retrieval-based Local Adaptation technique to restore relevant knowledge. Since a lifelong learning robot must operate in task-free scenarios, where task IDs and even boundaries are not available, our method performs effectively without relying on such information. We also incorporate a selective weighting mechanism to focus on the most "forgotten" skill segment, ensuring effective knowledge restoration. Experimental results across diverse manipulation tasks demonstrate that our framework provides a scalable paradigm for lifelong learning, enhancing robot performance in open-ended, task-free scenarios.</p></details> |  |

Vision-language models (VLMs), with their semantic reasoning over objects, spatial relations, and potential outcomes, present a compelling foundation for generating high-level exploratory behaviors. However, their outputs are often ungrounded, making it difficult to determine whether imagined transitions are physically feasible or informative. To bridge the gap between imagination and execution, we present IVE (Imagine, Verify, Execute), an agentic exploration framework inspired by human curiosity. Human exploration is often driven by the desire to discover novel scene configurations and to deepen understanding of the environment. Similarly, IVE leverages VLMs to abstract RGB-D observations into semantic scene graphs, imagine novel scenes, predict their physical plausibility, and generate executable skill sequences through action tools. We evaluate IVE in both simulated and real-world tabletop environments. The results show that IVE enables more diverse and meaningful exploration than RL baselines, as evidenced by a 4.1 to 7.8x increase in the entropy of visited states. Moreover, the collected experience supports downstream learning, producing policies that closely match or exceed the performance of those trained on human-collected demonstrations.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project webpage: https://ive-robot.github.io/</p></details> |
| **[RaC: Robot Learning for Long-Horizon Tasks by Scaling Recovery and Correction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07953v1)** | 2025-09-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modern paradigms for robot imitation train expressive policy architectures on large amounts of human demonstration data. Yet performance on contact-rich, deformable-object, and long-horizon tasks plateau far below perfect execution, even with thousands of expert demonstrations. This is due to the inefficiency of existing ``expert'' data collection procedures based on human teleoperation. To address this issue, we introduce RaC, a new phase of training on human-in-the-loop rollouts after imitation learning pre-training. In RaC, we fine-tune a robotic policy on human intervention trajectories that illustrate recovery and correction behaviors. Specifically, during a policy rollout, human operators intervene when failure appears imminent, first rewinding the robot back to a familiar, in-distribution state and then providing a corrective segment that completes the current sub-task. Training on this data composition expands the robotic skill repertoire to include retry and adaptation behaviors, which we show are crucial for boosting both efficiency and robustness on long-horizon tasks. Across three real-world bimanual control tasks: shirt hanging, airtight container lid sealing, takeout box packing, and a simulated assembly task, RaC outperforms the prior state-of-the-art using 10$\times$ less data collection time and samples. We also show that RaC enables test-time scaling: the performance of the trained RaC policy scales linearly in the number of recovery maneuvers it exhibits. Videos of the learned policy are available at https://rac-scaling-robot.github.io/.</p></details> |  |

However, no prior work has considered tactile sensing, which is known to be critical for human-like dexterity. We present Text2Touch, bringing LLM-crafted rewards to the challenging task of multi-axis in-hand object rotation with real-world vision based tactile sensing in palm-up and palm-down configurations. Our prompt engineering strategy scales to over 70 environment variables, and sim-to-real distillation enables successful policy transfer to a tactile-enabled fully actuated four-fingered dexterous robot hand. Text2Touch significantly outperforms a carefully tuned human-engineered baseline, demonstrating superior rotation speed and stability while relying on reward functions that are an order of magnitude shorter and simpler. These results illustrate how LLM-designed rewards can significantly reduce the time from concept to deployable dexterous tactile skills, supporting more rapid and scalable multimodal robot learning.

However, due to the scarcity of large-scale 3D data, it is still hard to extract a universal 3D representation from web datasets. Instead, we are seeking a general visual pre-training framework that could improve all 3D representations as an alternative. Our framework, called FVP, is a novel 4D Visual Pre-training framework for real-world robot learning. FVP frames the visual pre-training objective as a next-point-cloud-prediction problem, models the prediction model as a diffusion model, and pre-trains the model on the larger public datasets directly. Across twelve real-world manipulation tasks, FVP boosts the average success rate of 3D Diffusion Policy (DP3) for these tasks by 28%. The FVP pre-trained DP3 achieves state-of-the-art performance across imitation learning methods. Moreover, the efficacy of FVP adapts across various point cloud encoders and datasets. Finally, we apply FVP to the RDT-1B, a larger Vision-Language-Action robotic model, enhancing its performance on various robot tasks.

| **[Action Flow Matching for Continual Robot Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18471v2)** | 2025-09-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Continual learning in robotics seeks systems that can constantly adapt to changing environments and tasks, mirroring human adaptability. A key challenge is refining dynamics models, essential for planning and control, while addressing issues such as safe adaptation, catastrophic forgetting, outlier management, data efficiency, and balancing exploration with exploitation -- all within task and onboard resource constraints. Towards this goal, we introduce a generative framework leveraging flow matching for online robot dynamics model alignment. Rather than executing actions based on a misaligned model, our approach refines planned actions to better match with those the robot would take if its model was well aligned. We find that by transforming the actions themselves rather than exploring with a misaligned model -- as is traditionally done -- the robot collects informative data more efficiently, thereby accelerating learning. Moreover, we validate that the method can handle an evolving and possibly imperfect model while reducing, if desired, the dependency on replay buffers or legacy model snapshots. We validate our approach using two platforms: an unmanned ground vehicle and a quadrotor. The results highlight the method's adaptability and efficiency, with a record 34.2\% higher task success rate, demonstrating its potential towards enabling continual robot learning.

The proposed method learns a mapping from modifier directives to actions by segmenting demonstrations into short sequences, assigning weakly supervised labels corresponding to specific modifier types. We evaluated our method in wiping and pick and place tasks.

We focus on an offline setting where the agent has only a fixed dataset -- common in realistic tasks to prevent unsafe exploration. To address this, we propose Diffusion-Regularized Constrained Offline Reinforcement Learning (DRCORL), which first uses a diffusion model to capture the behavioral policy from offline data and then extracts a simplified policy to enable efficient inference. We further apply gradient manipulation for safety adaptation, balancing the reward objective and constraint satisfaction. This approach leverages high-quality offline data while incorporating safety requirements. Empirical results show that DRCORL achieves reliable safety performance, fast inference, and strong reward outcomes across robot learning tasks. Compared to existing safe offline RL methods, it consistently meets cost limits and performs well with the same hyperparameters, indicating practical applicability in real-world scenarios.</p></details> |  |
| **[FFHFlow: Diverse and Uncertainty-Aware Dexterous Grasp Generation via Flow Variational Inference](https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15161v4)** | 2025-09-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Synthesizing diverse, uncertainty-aware grasps for multi-fingered hands from partial observations remains a critical challenge in robot learning. Prior generative methods struggle to model the intricate grasp distribution of dexterous hands and often fail to reason about shape uncertainty inherent in partial point clouds, leading to unreliable or overly conservative grasps. We propose FFHFlow, a flow-based variational framework that generates diverse, robust multi-finger grasps while explicitly quantifying perceptual uncertainty in the partial point clouds. Our approach leverages a normalizing flow-based deep latent variable model to learn a hierarchical grasp manifold, overcoming the mode collapse and rigid prior limitations of conditional Variational Autoencoders (cVAEs). By exploiting the invertibility and exact likelihoods of flows, FFHFlow introspects shape uncertainty in partial observations and identifies novel object structures, enabling risk-aware grasp synthesis. To further enhance reliability, we integrate a discriminative grasp evaluator with the flow likelihoods, formulating an uncertainty-aware ranking strategy that prioritizes grasps robust to shape ambiguity. Extensive experiments in simulation and real-world setups demonstrate that FFHFlow outperforms state-of-the-art baselines (including diffusion models) in grasp diversity and success rate, while achieving run-time efficient sampling. We also showcase its practical value in cluttered and confined environments, where diversity-driven sampling excels by mitigating collisions (Project Page: https://sites.google.com/view/ffhflow/home/).</p></details> | <details><summary>First...</summary><p>First two authors contributed equally, whose ordering decided via coin-tossing.

Nevertheless, translating multi-source human hand motions into feasible robot behaviors remains challenging, particularly for robots equipped with multi-fingered dexterous hands characterized by complex, high-dimensional action spaces. Moreover, existing approaches often struggle to produce policies capable of adapting to diverse environmental conditions. In this paper, we introduce HERMES, a human-to-robot learning framework for mobile bimanual dexterous manipulation. First, HERMES formulates a unified reinforcement learning approach capable of seamlessly transforming heterogeneous human hand motions from multiple sources into physically plausible robotic behaviors. Subsequently, to mitigate the sim2real gap, we devise an end-to-end, depth image-based sim2real transfer method for improved generalization to real-world scenarios. Furthermore, to enable autonomous operation in varied and unstructured environments, we augment the navigation foundation model with a closed-loop Perspective-n-Point (PnP) localization mechanism, ensuring precise alignment of visual goals and effectively bridging autonomous navigation and dexterous manipulation. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that HERMES consistently exhibits generalizable behaviors across diverse, in-the-wild scenarios, successfully performing numerous complex mobile bimanual dexterous manipulation tasks.

However, these advances can rely on proprietary simulators, expensive hardware, and a daunting range of tools and skills.

This provides an interesting use case to study interactions between pedestrians and mobile robots because, in the vast majority of cases, this phenomenon is avoided through a negotiation based on implicit communication. Understanding how it goes wrong and how pedestrians end up in the sidewalk salsa will therefore provide insight into the implicit communication. This understanding can be used to design safe and acceptable robotic behaviour. In a previous attempt to gain this understanding, a model of pedestrian behaviour based on the Communication-Enabled Interaction (CEI) framework was developed that can replicate the sidewalk salsa. However, it is unclear how to leverage this model in robotic planning and decision-making since it violates the assumptions of game theory, a much-used framework in planning and decision-making. Here, we present a proof-of-concept for an approach where a Reinforcement Learning (RL) agent leverages the model to learn how to interact with pedestrians. The results show that a basic RL agent successfully learned to interact with the CEI model. Furthermore, a risk-averse RL agent that had access to the perceived risk of the CEI model learned how to effectively communicate its intention through its motion and thereby substantially lowered the perceived risk, and displayed effort by the modelled pedestrian. These results show this is a promising approach and encourage further exploration.</p></details> |  |

Learning such behaviors directly on physical hardware remains challenging due to safety and data efficiency constraints. Existing methods, including Quality-Diversity Actor-Critic (QDAC), require manually defined skill spaces and carefully tuned heuristics, limiting real-world applicability. We propose Unsupervised Real-world Skill Acquisition (URSA), an extension of QDAC that enables robots to autonomously discover and master diverse, high-performing skills directly in the real world. We demonstrate that URSA successfully discovers diverse locomotion skills on a Unitree A1 quadruped in both simulation and the real world. Our approach supports both heuristic-driven skill discovery and fully unsupervised settings. We also show that the learned skill repertoire can be reused for downstream tasks such as real-world damage adaptation, where URSA outperforms all baselines in 5 out of 9 simulated and 3 out of 5 real-world damage scenarios. Our results establish a new framework for real-world robot learning that enables continuous skill discovery with limited human intervention, representing a significant step toward more autonomous and adaptable robotic systems.

Yet, their application to contact-rich tasks like locomotion is complicated by the inherently non-smooth nature of contact, impeding effective gradient-based optimization. Existing works thus often rely on soft contact models that provide smooth gradients but lack physical accuracy, constraining results to simulation. To address this limitation, we propose a differentiable contact model designed to provide informative gradients while maintaining high physical fidelity. We demonstrate the efficacy of our approach by training a quadrupedal locomotion policy within our differentiable simulator leveraging analytic gradients and successfully transferring the learned policy zero-shot to the real world. To the best of our knowledge, this represents the first successful sim-to-real transfer of a legged locomotion policy learned entirely within a differentiable simulator, establishing the feasibility of using differentiable simulation for real-world locomotion control.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to the 9th Conference on Robot Learning (CoRL 2025), Seoul, Korea</p></details> |

This study addresses this challenge via imitation-based deep reinforcement learning with a progressive training process. To start, we learn the jumping skill by mimicking a coarse jumping example generated by model-based trajectory optimization. Subsequently, we generalize the learned policy to broader situations, including various distances in both forward and lateral directions, and then pursue robust jumping in unknown ground unevenness. In addition, without tuning the reward much, we learn the jumping policy for a quadruped with parallel elasticity. Results show that using the proposed method, i) the robot learns versatile jumps by learning only from a single demonstration, ii) the robot with parallel compliance reduces the landing error by 11.1%, saves energy cost by 15.2% and reduces the peak torque by 15.8%, compared to the rigid robot without parallel elasticity, iii) the robot can perform jumps of variable distances with robustness against ground unevenness (maximal 4cm height perturbations) using only proprioceptive perception.</p></details> | accepted by IROS2025 |

Neural reconstruction methods have promised the capability of reconstructing large physically-grounded outdoor scenes from captured sensor data. However, these methods have baked-in static environments and only allow for limited scene control -- they are functionally constrained in scene and trajectory diversity by the captures from which they are reconstructed. In contrast, generating driving data with recent image or video diffusion models offers control, however, at the cost of geometry grounding and causality. In this work, we aim to bridge this gap and present a method that directly generates large-scale 3D driving scenes with accurate geometry, allowing for causal novel view synthesis with object permanence and explicit 3D geometry estimation. The proposed method combines the generation of a proxy geometry and environment representation with score distillation from learned 2D image priors. We find that this approach allows for high controllability, enabling the prompt-guided geometry and high-fidelity texture and structure that can be conditioned on map layouts -- producing realistic and geometrically consistent 3D generations of complex driving scenes.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project webpage: https://light.princeton.edu/LSD-3D</p></details> |

We propose a novel technique for training sensorimotor policies with reinforcement learning by imitating predictive models of human motions. Our key insight is that the motion of keypoints on human-inspired robot end-effectors closely mirrors the motion of corresponding human body keypoints. This enables us to use a model trained to predict future motion on human data \emph{zero-shot} on robot data. We train sensorimotor policies to track the predictions of such a model, conditioned on a history of past robot states, while optimizing a relatively sparse task reward. This approach entirely bypasses gradient-based kinematic retargeting and adversarial losses, which limit existing methods from fully leveraging the scale and diversity of modern human-scene interaction datasets. Empirically, we find that our approach can work across robots and tasks, outperforming existing baselines by a large margin. In addition, we find that tracking a human motion model can substitute for carefully designed dense rewards and curricula in manipulation tasks.

We introduce SDS ("See it. Do it. Sorted."), an automated pipeline for skill acquisition from unstructured demonstrations. Using GPT-4o, SDS applies novel prompting techniques, in the form of spatio-temporal grid-based visual encoding ($G_{v}$) and structured input decomposition (SUS). These produce executable reward functions (RF) from the raw input videos. The RFs are used to train PPO policies and are optimized through closed-loop evolution, using training footage and performance metrics as self-supervised signals. SDS allows quadrupeds (e.g. Unitree Go1) to learn four gaits -- trot, bound, pace, and hop -- achieving 100% gait matching fidelity, Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) distance in the order of $10^{-6}$, and stable locomotion with zero failures, both in simulation and the real world. SDS generalizes to morphologically different quadrupeds (e.g. ANYmal) and outperforms prior work in data efficiency, training time and engineering effort.

| **[STRAP: Robot Sub-Trajectory Retrieval for Augmented Policy Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15182v2)** | 2025-08-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Robot learning is witnessing a significant increase in the size, diversity, and complexity of pre-collected datasets, mirroring trends in domains such as natural language processing and computer vision. Many robot learning methods treat such datasets as multi-task expert data and learn a multi-task, generalist policy by training broadly across them. Notably, while these generalist policies can improve the average performance across many tasks, the performance of generalist policies on any one task is often suboptimal due to negative transfer between partitions of the data, compared to task-specific specialist policies. In this work, we argue for the paradigm of training policies during deployment given the scenarios they encounter: rather than deploying pre-trained policies to unseen problems in a zero-shot manner, we non-parametrically retrieve and train models directly on relevant data at test time. Furthermore, we show that many robotics tasks share considerable amounts of low-level behaviors and that retrieval at the "sub"-trajectory granularity enables significantly improved data utilization, generalization, and robustness in adapting policies to novel problems. In contrast, existing full-trajectory retrieval methods tend to underutilize the data and miss out on shared cross-task content. This work proposes STRAP, a technique for leveraging pre-trained vision foundation models and dynamic time warping to retrieve sub-sequences of trajectories from large training corpora in a robust fashion. STRAP outperforms both prior retrieval algorithms and multi-task learning methods in simulated and real experiments, showing the ability to scale to much larger offline datasets in the real world as well as the ability to learn robust control policies with just a handful of real-world demonstrations.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project website at https://weirdlabuw.github.io/strap/</p></details> |

Videos of human-object interactions are easier to collect and scale, but leveraging them directly for robot learning is difficult due to the lack of explicit action labels and human-robot embodiment differences. We propose Human2Sim2Robot, a novel real-to-sim-to-real framework for training dexterous manipulation policies using only one RGB-D video of a human demonstrating a task. Our method utilizes reinforcement learning (RL) in simulation to cross the embodiment gap without relying on wearables, teleoperation, or large-scale data collection. From the video, we extract: (1) the object pose trajectory to define an object-centric, embodiment-agnostic reward, and (2) the pre-manipulation hand pose to initialize and guide exploration during RL training. These components enable effective policy learning without any task-specific reward tuning. In the single human demo regime, Human2Sim2Robot outperforms object-aware replay by over 55% and imitation learning by over 68% on grasping, non-prehensile manipulation, and multi-step tasks.

While vision-language-action (VLA) models have shown promise for generalizable robot skills, realizing their full potential requires addressing limitations in action representation and efficient training. Current VLA models often focus on scaling the vision-language model (VLM) component, while the action space representation remains a critical bottleneck. This paper introduces DexVLA, a novel framework designed to enhance the efficiency and generalization capabilities of VLAs for complex, long-horizon tasks across diverse robot embodiments. DexVLA features a novel diffusion-based action expert, scaled to one billion parameters, designed for cross-embodiment learning. A novel embodiment curriculum learning strategy facilitates efficient training: (1) pre-training the diffusion expert that is separable from the VLA on cross-embodiment data, (2) aligning the VLA model to specific embodiments, and (3) post-training for rapid adaptation to new tasks. We conduct comprehensive experiments across multiple embodiments, including single-arm, bimanual, and dexterous hand, demonstrating DexVLA's adaptability to challenging tasks without task-specific adaptation, its ability to learn dexterous skills on novel embodiments with limited data, and its capacity to complete complex, long-horizon tasks using only direct language prompting, such as laundry folding.

This work tackles two key challenges: efficient skill acquisition from limited human demonstrations and context-driven skill selection. We introduce AdaDexGrasp, a framework that learns a library of grasping skills from a single human demonstration per skill and selects the most suitable one using a vision-language model (VLM). To improve sample efficiency, we propose a trajectory following reward that guides reinforcement learning (RL) toward states close to a human demonstration while allowing flexibility in exploration. To learn beyond the single demonstration, we employ curriculum learning, progressively increasing object pose variations to enhance robustness. At deployment, a VLM retrieves the appropriate skill based on user instructions, bridging low-level learned skills with high-level intent. We evaluate AdaDexGrasp in both simulation and real-world settings, showing that our approach significantly improves RL efficiency and enables learning human-like grasp strategies across varied object configurations. Finally, we demonstrate zero-shot transfer of our learned policies to a real-world PSYONIC Ability Hand, with a 90% success rate across objects, significantly outperforming the baseline.</p></details> |  |
| **[DiWA: Diffusion Policy Adaptation with World Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03645v1)** | 2025-08-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Fine-tuning diffusion policies with reinforcement learning (RL) presents significant challenges. The long denoising sequence for each action prediction impedes effective reward propagation. Moreover, standard RL methods require millions of real-world interactions, posing a major bottleneck for practical fine-tuning. Although prior work frames the denoising process in diffusion policies as a Markov Decision Process to enable RL-based updates, its strong dependence on environment interaction remains highly inefficient. To bridge this gap, we introduce DiWA, a novel framework that leverages a world model for fine-tuning diffusion-based robotic skills entirely offline with reinforcement learning. Unlike model-free approaches that require millions of environment interactions to fine-tune a repertoire of robot skills, DiWA achieves effective adaptation using a world model trained once on a few hundred thousand offline play interactions. This results in dramatically improved sample efficiency, making the approach significantly more practical and safer for real-world robot learning. On the challenging CALVIN benchmark, DiWA improves performance across eight tasks using only offline adaptation, while requiring orders of magnitude fewer physical interactions than model-free baselines. To our knowledge, this is the first demonstration of fine-tuning diffusion policies for real-world robotic skills using an offline world model. We make the code publicly available at https://diwa.cs.uni-freiburg.de.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at the 2025 Conference on Robot Learning (CoRL)</p></details> |

Recent advances tackle this problem via learning from demonstration images. However, these methods fail to capture the general affordance knowledge within the image, leading to poor generalization. To address this issue, we propose to use text-to-image diffusion models to extract the general affordance knowledge because we find that such models can generate semantically valid HOI images, which demonstrate that their internal representation space is highly correlated with real-world affordance concepts. Specifically, we introduce the DAG, a diffusion-based 3d affordance grounding framework, which leverages the frozen internal representations of the text-to-image diffusion model and unlocks affordance knowledge within the diffusion model to perform 3D affordance grounding. We further introduce an affordance block and a multi-source affordance decoder to endow 3D dense affordance prediction. Extensive experimental evaluations show that our model excels over well-established methods and exhibits open-world generalization.</p></details> |  |

Yet ensuring dynamic safety, i.e., constraint satisfaction, remains challenging for such policies. Reinforcement learning (RL) embeds constraints heuristically through reward engineering, and adding or modifying constraints requires retraining. Model-based approaches, like control barrier functions (CBFs), enable runtime constraint specification with formal guarantees but require accurate dynamics models. This paper presents SHIELD, a layered safety framework that bridges this gap by: (1) training a generative, stochastic dynamics residual model using real-world data from hardware rollouts of the nominal controller, capturing system behavior and uncertainties; and (2) adding a safety layer on top of the nominal (learned locomotion) controller that leverages this model via a stochastic discrete-time CBF formulation enforcing safety constraints in probability. The result is a minimally-invasive safety layer that can be added to the existing autonomy stack to give probabilistic guarantees of safety that balance risk and performance. In hardware experiments on an Unitree G1 humanoid, SHIELD enables safe navigation (obstacle avoidance) through varied indoor and outdoor environments using a nominal (unknown) RL controller and onboard perception.</p></details> | <details><summary>Video...</summary><p>Video at https://youtu.be/-Qv1wR4jfj4.

| **[Exploiting Local Observations for Robust Robot Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.14792v4)** | 2025-07-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While many robotic tasks can be addressed using either centralized single-agent control with full state observation or decentralized multi-agent control, clear criteria for choosing between these approaches remain underexplored. This paper systematically investigates how multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) with local observations can improve robustness in complex robotic systems compared to traditional centralized control. Through theoretical analysis and empirical validation, we show that in certain tasks, decentralized MARL can achieve performance comparable to centralized methods while exhibiting greater resilience to perturbations and agent failures. By analytically demonstrating the equivalence of single-agent reinforcement learning (SARL) and MARL under full observability, we identify observability as the critical factor distinguishing the two paradigms. We further derive bounds quantifying performance degradation under external perturbations for locally observable policies. Empirical results on standard MARL benchmarks confirm that MARL with limited observations can maintain competitive performance. Finally, real-world experiments with a mobile manipulator demonstrate that decentralized MARL controllers achieve markedly improved robustness to agent malfunctions and environmental disturbances relative to centralized baselines. Together, these findings highlight MARL with local observations as a robust and practical alternative to conventional centralized control in complex robotic systems.</p></details> | 8 pages, 8 figures |

However, these models trained solely on offline data, often lack the capacity to reason about the consequences of their actions or adapt through counterfactual understanding. They thus face significant limitations in the real-world urban navigation where interactive and safe behaviors, such as avoiding obstacles and moving pedestrians, are critical. To tackle these challenges, we introduce the Seeing-to-Experiencing framework to scale the capability of navigation foundation models with reinforcement learning. S2E combines the strengths of pre-training on videos and post-training through RL. It maintains the generalizability acquired from large-scale real-world videos while enhancing its interactivity through RL in simulation environments. Specifically, we introduce two innovations: an Anchor-Guided Distribution Matching strategy, which stabilizes learning and models diverse motion patterns through anchor-based supervision; and a Residual-Attention Module, which obtains reactive behaviors from simulation environments without erasing the model's pretrained knowledge. Moreover, we establish a comprehensive end-to-end evaluation benchmark, NavBench-GS, built on photorealistic 3DGS reconstructions of real-world scenes that incorporate physical interactions. It can systematically assess the generalizability and safety of navigation foundation models. Extensive experiments show that S2E mitigates the diminishing returns often seen when scaling with offline data alone. We perform a thorough analysis of the benefits of Reinforcement Learning compared to Supervised Fine-Tuning in the context of post-training for robot learning. Our findings emphasize the crucial role of integrating interactive online experiences to effectively scale foundation models in Robotics.</p></details> |  |

However, manipulating deformable objects and materials remains a major challenge for existing robot learning algorithms. While various benchmarks have been proposed to evaluate manipulation strategies with rigid objects, there is still a notable lack of standardized benchmarks that address mobile manipulation tasks involving deformable objects. To address this gap, we introduce MoDeSuite, the first Mobile Manipulation Deformable Object task suite, designed specifically for robot learning. MoDeSuite consists of eight distinct mobile manipulation tasks covering both elastic objects and deformable objects, each presenting a unique challenge inspired by real-world robot applications. Success in these tasks requires effective collaboration between the robot's base and manipulator, as well as the ability to exploit the deformability of the objects. To evaluate and demonstrate the use of the proposed benchmark, we train two state-of-the-art reinforcement learning algorithms and two imitation learning algorithms, highlighting the difficulties encountered and showing their performance in simulation. Furthermore, we demonstrate the practical relevance of the suite by deploying the trained policies directly into the real world with the Spot robot, showcasing the potential for sim-to-real transfer. We expect that MoDeSuite will open a novel research domain in mobile manipulation involving deformable objects.

Our architecture achieves significant improvements in zero-shot performance without requiring task-specific fine-tuning, while reducing inference computational requirements by 42%.

We show that, even if the dynamics satisfy a control-theoretic property called exponential stability (i.e. the effects of perturbations decay exponentially quickly), and the expert is smooth and deterministic, any smooth, deterministic imitator policy necessarily suffers error on execution that is exponentially larger, as a function of problem horizon, than the error under the distribution of expert training data. Our negative result applies to any algorithm which learns solely from expert data, including both behavior cloning and offline-RL algorithms, unless the algorithm produces highly "improper" imitator policies--those which are non-smooth, non-Markovian, or which exhibit highly state-dependent stochasticity--or unless the expert trajectory distribution is sufficiently "spread." We provide experimental evidence of the benefits of these more complex policy parameterizations, explicating the benefits of today's popular policy parameterizations in robot learning (e.g. action-chunking and diffusion policies). We also establish a host of complementary negative and positive results for imitation in control systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>98 pa...</summary><p>98 pages, 2 figures, updated proof sketch</p></details> |

However, obtaining a robust and dense reward signal for general manipulation tasks remains a challenge. Existing learning-based approaches require significant data, such as human demonstrations of success and failure, to learn task-specific reward functions. Recently, there is also a growing adoption of large multi-modal foundation models for robotics that can perform visual reasoning in physical contexts and generate coarse robot motions for manipulation tasks. Motivated by this range of capability, in this work, we present Keypoint-based Affordance Guidance for Improvements (KAGI), a method leveraging rewards shaped by vision-language models (VLMs) for autonomous RL. State-of-the-art VLMs have demonstrated impressive zero-shot reasoning about affordances through keypoints, and we use these to define dense rewards that guide autonomous robotic learning. On diverse real-world manipulation tasks specified by natural language descriptions, KAGI improves the sample efficiency of autonomous RL and enables successful task completion in 30K online fine-tuning steps. Additionally, we demonstrate the robustness of KAGI to reductions in the number of in-domain demonstrations used for pre-training, reaching similar performance in 45K online fine-tuning steps.

These tools are not tailored for particular operations, making their longevity highly sensitive to how they are used. This creates a fundamental challenge: how can a robot learn a tool-use policy that both completes the task and prolongs the tool's lifespan? In this work, we address this challenge by introducing a reinforcement learning (RL) framework that incorporates tool lifespan as a factor during policy optimization. Our framework leverages Finite Element Analysis (FEA) and Miner's Rule to estimate Remaining Useful Life (RUL) based on accumulated stress, and integrates the RUL into the RL reward to guide policy learning toward lifespan-guided behavior. To handle the fact that RUL can only be estimated after task execution, we introduce an Adaptive Reward Normalization (ARN) mechanism that dynamically adjusts reward scaling based on estimated RULs, ensuring stable learning signals. We validate our method across simulated and real-world tool use tasks, including Object-Moving and Door-Opening with multiple general-purpose tools. The learned policies consistently prolong tool lifespan (up to 8.01x in simulation) and transfer effectively to real-world settings, demonstrating the practical value of learning lifespan-guided tool use strategies.</p></details> | Under review |

Robot learning, however, has thus far failed to replicate this success and remains constrained by a scarcity of available data. Learning from videos (LfV) methods aim to address this data bottleneck by augmenting traditional robot data with large-scale internet video. This video data provides foundational information regarding physical dynamics, behaviours, and tasks, and can be highly informative for general-purpose robots. This survey systematically examines the emerging field of LfV. We first outline essential concepts, including detailing fundamental LfV challenges such as distribution shift and missing action labels in video data. Next, we comprehensively review current methods for extracting knowledge from large-scale internet video, overcoming LfV challenges, and improving robot learning through video-informed training. The survey concludes with a critical discussion of future opportunities. Here, we emphasize the need for scalable foundation model approaches that can leverage the full range of available internet video and enhance the learning of robot policies and dynamics models. Overall, the survey aims to inform and catalyse future LfV research, driving progress towards general-purpose robots.</p></details> |  |

For this edge training, Microscaling (MX) data types offer a promising solution by combining integer and floating-point representations with shared exponents, reducing energy consumption while maintaining accuracy. However, the state-of-the-art continuous learning processor, namely Dacapo, faces limitations with its MXINT-only support and inefficient vector-based grouping during backpropagation. In this paper, we present, to the best of our knowledge, the first work that addresses these limitations with two key innovations: (1) a precision-scalable arithmetic unit that supports all six MX data types by exploiting sub-word parallelism and unified integer and floating-point processing; and (2) support for square shared exponent groups to enable efficient weight handling during backpropagation, removing storage redundancy and quantization overhead. We evaluate our design against Dacapo under iso-peak-throughput on four robotics workloads in TSMC 16nm FinFET technology at 400MHz, reaching a 51% lower memory footprint, and 4x higher effective training throughput, while achieving comparable energy efficiency, enabling efficient robotics continual learning at the edge.</p></details> | <details><summary>To ap...</summary><p>To appear in 2025 IEEE/ACM International Symposium on Low Power Electronics and Design (ISLPED 2025)</p></details> |

A promising approach is to mirror the evolutionary trajectory of humans: learning through continuous interaction with the environment, with early progress driven by the imitation of human behaviors. Achieving this goal presents three core challenges: (1) designing safe robotic hardware with human-level physical capabilities; (2) developing an intuitive and scalable whole-body teleoperation interface for data collection; and (3) creating algorithms capable of learning whole-body visuomotor policies from human demonstrations. To address these challenges in a unified framework, we propose Astribot Suite, a robot learning suite for whole-body manipulation aimed at general daily tasks across diverse environments. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our system on a wide range of activities that require whole-body coordination, extensive reachability, human-level dexterity, and agility. Our results show that Astribot's cohesive integration of embodiment, teleoperation interface, and learning pipeline marks a significant step towards real-world, general-purpose whole-body robotic manipulation, laying the groundwork for the next generation of intelligent robots.</p></details> |  |

During multi-robot operations, a robot needs to know the relative pose between itself and its teammates with respect to its own coordinates. However, different robots usually observe completely different views that contains similar objects, which leads to wrong pose estimation. In addition, it is unrealistic to allow robots to share their raw observations to detect overlap due to the limited communication bandwidth constraint. In this paper, we introduce a novel method for Non-Overlap-Aware Egocentric Pose Estimation (NOPE), which performs egocentric pose estimation in a multi-robot team while identifying the non-overlap views and satifying the communication bandwidth constraint. NOPE is built upon an unified hierarchical learning framework that integrates two levels of robot learning: (1) high-level deep graph matching for correspondence identification, which allows to identify if two views are overlapping or not, (2) low-level position-aware cross-attention graph learning for egocentric pose estimation. To evaluate NOPE, we conduct extensive experiments in both high-fidelity simulation and real-world scenarios. Experimental results have demonstrated that NOPE enables the novel capability for non-overlapping-aware egocentric pose estimation and achieves state-of-art performance compared with the existing methods.

FL has proven its benefits for robotic manipulation tasks. However, grasping tasks lack exploration in such settings where robots train a global model without moving data and ensuring data privacy. The main challenge is that each robot learns from data that is nonindependent and identically distributed (non-IID) and of low quantity. This exhibits performance degradation, particularly in robotic grasping. Thus, in this work, we propose MTF-Grasp, a multi-tier FL approach for robotic grasping, acknowledging the unique challenges posed by the non-IID data distribution across robots, including quantitative skewness. MTF-Grasp harnesses data quality and quantity across robots to select a set of "top-level" robots with better data distribution and higher sample count. It then utilizes top-level robots to train initial seed models and distribute them to the remaining "low-level" robots, reducing the risk of model performance degradation in low-level robots. Our approach outperforms the conventional FL setup by up to 8% on the quantity-skewed Cornell and Jacquard grasping datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>The w...</summary><p>The work is accepted for presentation at IEEE SMC 2025</p></details> |

For example, the user may ask to "put the two granny smith apples inside the basket", but the agent cannot correctly identify which objects in the environment are "granny smith" as the agent has not been exposed to such a concept before. We introduce SECURE, an interactive task learning policy designed to tackle such scenarios. The unique feature of SECURE is its ability to enable agents to engage in semantic analysis when processing embodied conversations and making decisions. Through embodied conversation, a SECURE agent adjusts its deficient domain model by engaging in dialogue to identify and learn about previously unforeseen possibilities. The SECURE agent learns from the user's embodied corrective feedback when mistakes are made and strategically engages in dialogue to uncover useful information about novel concepts relevant to the task. These capabilities enable the SECURE agent to generalize to new tasks with the acquired knowledge. We demonstrate in the simulated Blocksworld and the real-world apple manipulation environments that the SECURE agent, which solves such rearrangements under unawareness, is more data-efficient than agents that do not engage in embodied conversation or semantic analysis.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published at 4th Conference on Lifelong Learning Agents (CoLLAs), 2025</p></details> |

A major bottleneck is software: current robot stacks demand steep learning curves, low-level C/C++ expertise, fragmented tooling, and intricate hardware integration, in stark contrast to the Python-centric, well-documented ecosystems that propelled modern AI. We introduce ARK, an open-source, Python-first robotics framework designed to close that gap. ARK presents a Gym-style environment interface that allows users to collect data, preprocess it, and train policies using state-of-the-art imitation-learning algorithms (e.g., ACT, Diffusion Policy) while seamlessly toggling between high-fidelity simulation and physical robots. A lightweight client-server architecture provides networked publisher-subscriber communication, and optional C/C++ bindings ensure real-time performance when needed. ARK ships with reusable modules for control, SLAM, motion planning, system identification, and visualization, along with native ROS interoperability. Comprehensive documentation and case studies-from manipulation to mobile navigation-demonstrate rapid prototyping, effortless hardware swapping, and end-to-end pipelines that rival the convenience of mainstream machine-learning workflows. By unifying robotics and AI practices under a common Python umbrella, ARK lowers entry barriers and accelerates research and commercial deployment of autonomous robots.</p></details> |  |

However, contrary to Moravec's paradox, dexterous intelligence in humans appears simple only superficially. Many million years were spent co-evolving the human brain and hands including rich tactile sensing. Achieving human-level dexterity with robotic hands has long been a fundamental goal in robotics and represents a critical milestone toward general embodied intelligence. In this pursuit, computational sensorimotor learning has made significant progress, enabling feats such as arbitrary in-hand object reorientation. However, we observe that achieving higher levels of dexterity requires overcoming very fundamental limitations of computational sensorimotor learning. I develop robot learning methods for highly dexterous multi-fingered manipulation by directly addressing these limitations at their root cause. Chiefly, through key studies, this disseration progressively builds an effective framework for reinforcement learning of dexterous multi-fingered manipulation skills. These methods adopt structured exploration, effectively overcoming the limitations of random exploration in reinforcement learning. The insights gained culminate in a highly effective reinforcement learning that incorporates sampling-based planning for direct exploration. Additionally, this thesis explores a new paradigm of using visuo-tactile human demonstrations for dexterity, introducing corresponding imitation learning techniques.</p></details> | PhD thesis |

In this work, we investigate the nuanced role of data diversity in robot learning by examining three critical dimensions-task (what to do), embodiment (which robot to use), and expert (who demonstrates)-challenging the conventional intuition of "more diverse is better". Throughout extensive experiments on various robot platforms, we reveal that (1) task diversity proves more critical than per-task demonstration quantity, benefiting transfer from diverse pre-training tasks to novel downstream scenarios; (2) multi-embodiment pre-training data is optional for cross-embodiment transfer-models trained on high-quality single-embodiment data can efficiently transfer to different platforms, showing more desirable scaling property during fine-tuning than multi-embodiment pre-trained models; and (3) expert diversity, arising from individual operational preferences and stochastic variations in human demonstrations, can be confounding to policy learning, with velocity multimodality emerging as a key contributing factor. Based on this insight, we propose a distribution debiasing method to mitigate velocity ambiguity, the yielding GO-1-Pro achieves substantial performance gains of 15%, equivalent to using 2.5 times pre-training data. Collectively, these findings provide new perspectives and offer practical guidance on how to scale robotic manipulation datasets effectively.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code ...</summary><p>Code is available at https://github.com/OpenDriveLab/AgiBot-World</p></details> |

Although imitation learning has proven to be an effective approach for teaching robots new skills, large amounts of expert demonstration data are still indispensible for these complex tasks, resulting in high sample complexity and costly data collection. To address this, we propose Semantic Keypoint Imitation Learning (SKIL), a framework which automatically obtains semantic keypoints with the help of vision foundation models, and forms the descriptor of semantic keypoints that enables efficient imitation learning of complex robotic tasks with significantly lower sample complexity. In real-world experiments, SKIL doubles the performance of baseline methods in tasks such as picking a cup or mouse, while demonstrating exceptional robustness to variations in objects, environmental changes, and distractors. For long-horizon tasks like hanging a towel on a rack where previous methods fail completely, SKIL achieves a mean success rate of 70\% with as few as 30 demonstrations. Furthermore, SKIL naturally supports cross-embodiment learning due to its semantic keypoints abstraction. Our experiments demonstrate that even human videos bring considerable improvement to the learning performance. All these results demonstrate the great success of SKIL in achieving data-efficient generalizable robotic learning.

Robotic ultrasound can further enhance its utility by reducing operator dependence and improving access to complex anatomical regions. For this, while deep reinforcement learning (DRL) and imitation learning (IL) have shown potential for autonomous navigation, their use in complex surgical tasks such as anatomy reconstruction and surgical guidance remains limited -- largely due to the lack of realistic and efficient simulation environments tailored to these tasks. We introduce SonoGym, a scalable simulation platform for complex robotic ultrasound tasks that enables parallel simulation across tens to hundreds of environments. Our framework supports realistic and real-time simulation of US data from CT-derived 3D models of the anatomy through both a physics-based and a generative modeling approach. Sonogym enables the training of DRL and recent IL agents (vision transformers and diffusion policies) for relevant tasks in robotic orthopedic surgery by integrating common robotic platforms and orthopedic end effectors. We further incorporate submodular DRL -- a recent method that handles history-dependent rewards -- for anatomy reconstruction and safe reinforcement learning for surgery. Our results demonstrate successful policy learning across a range of scenarios, while also highlighting the limitations of current methods in clinically relevant environments. We believe our simulation can facilitate research in robot learning approaches for such challenging robotic surgery applications.

| **[Learning Efficient Robotic Garment Manipulation with Standardization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22769v1)** | 2025-06-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Garment manipulation is a significant challenge for robots due to the complex dynamics and potential self-occlusion of garments. Most existing methods of efficient garment unfolding overlook the crucial role of standardization of flattened garments, which could significantly simplify downstream tasks like folding, ironing, and packing. This paper presents APS-Net, a novel approach to garment manipulation that combines unfolding and standardization in a unified framework. APS-Net employs a dual-arm, multi-primitive policy with dynamic fling to quickly unfold crumpled garments and pick-and-place (p and p) for precise alignment. The purpose of garment standardization during unfolding involves not only maximizing surface coverage but also aligning the garment's shape and orientation to predefined requirements. To guide effective robot learning, we introduce a novel factorized reward function for standardization, which incorporates garment coverage (Cov), keypoint distance (KD), and intersection-over-union (IoU) metrics. Additionally, we introduce a spatial action mask and an Action Optimized Module to improve unfolding efficiency by selecting actions and operation points effectively. In simulation, APS-Net outperforms state-of-the-art methods for long sleeves, achieving 3.9 percent better coverage, 5.2 percent higher IoU, and a 0.14 decrease in KD (7.09 percent relative reduction). Real-world folding tasks further demonstrate that standardization simplifies the folding process. Project page: see https://hellohaia.github.io/APS/</p></details> |  |

However, the high cost and inefficiency of collecting real-world demonstrations hinder the scalability of data acquisition. While existing simulation platforms enable controlled environments for robotic learning, the challenge of bridging the sim-to-real gap remains. To address these challenges, we propose RoboPearls, an editable video simulation framework for robotic manipulation. Built on 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS), RoboPearls enables the construction of photo-realistic, view-consistent simulations from demonstration videos, and supports a wide range of simulation operators, including various object manipulations, powered by advanced modules like Incremental Semantic Distillation (ISD) and 3D regularized NNFM Loss (3D-NNFM). Moreover, by incorporating large language models (LLMs), RoboPearls automates the simulation production process in a user-friendly manner through flexible command interpretation and execution. Furthermore, RoboPearls employs a vision-language model (VLM) to analyze robotic learning issues to close the simulation loop for performance enhancement. To demonstrate the effectiveness of RoboPearls, we conduct extensive experiments on multiple datasets and scenes, including RLBench, COLOSSEUM, Ego4D, Open X-Embodiment, and a real-world robot, which demonstrate our satisfactory simulation performance.</p></details> | ICCV 2025 |

To address this challenge, we propose knowledge-driven imitation learning, a framework that leverages external structural semantic knowledge to abstract object representations within the same category. We introduce a novel semantic keypoint graph as a knowledge template and develop a coarse-to-fine template-matching algorithm that optimizes both structural consistency and semantic similarity. Evaluated on three real-world robotic manipulation tasks, our method achieves superior performance, surpassing image-based diffusion policies with only one-quarter of the expert demonstrations. Extensive experiments further demonstrate its robustness across novel objects, backgrounds, and lighting conditions. This work pioneers a knowledge-driven approach to data-efficient robotic learning in real-world settings.

| **[Robots and Children that Learn Together : Improving Knowledge Retention by Teaching Peer-Like Interactive Robots](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18365v1)** | 2025-06-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite growing interest in Learning-by-Teaching (LbT), few studies have explored how this paradigm can be implemented with autonomous, peer-like social robots in real classrooms. Most prior work has relied on scripted or Wizard-of-Oz behaviors, limiting our understanding of how real-time, interactive learning can be supported by artificial agents. This study addresses this gap by introducing Interactive Reinforcement Learning (RL) as a cognitive model for teachable social robots. We conducted two between-subject experiments with 58 primary school children, who either taught a robot or practiced independently on a tablet while learning French vocabulary (memorization) and grammatical rules (inference). The robot, powered by Interactive RL, learned from the child's evaluative feedback. Children in the LbT condition achieved significantly higher retention gains compared to those in the self-practice condition, especially on the grammar task. Learners with lower prior knowledge benefited most from teaching the robot. Behavioural metrics revealed that children adapted their teaching strategies over time and engaged more deeply during inference tasks. This work makes two contributions: (1) it introduces Interactive RL as a pedagogically effective and scalable model for peer-robot learning, and (2) it demonstrates, for the first time, the feasibility of deploying multiple autonomous robots simultaneously in real classrooms. These findings extend theoretical understanding of LbT by showing that social robots can function not only as passive tutees but as adaptive partners that enhance meta-cognitive engagement and long-term learning outcomes.</p></details> |  |
| **[Active Fine-Tuning of Multi-Task Policies](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05026v3)** | 2025-06-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Pre-trained generalist policies are rapidly gaining relevance in robot learning due to their promise of fast adaptation to novel, in-domain tasks. This adaptation often relies on collecting new demonstrations for a specific task of interest and applying imitation learning algorithms, such as behavioral cloning. However, as soon as several tasks need to be learned, we must decide which tasks should be demonstrated and how often? We study this multi-task problem and explore an interactive framework in which the agent adaptively selects the tasks to be demonstrated. We propose AMF (Active Multi-task Fine-tuning), an algorithm to maximize multi-task policy performance under a limited demonstration budget by collecting demonstrations yielding the largest information gain on the expert policy. We derive performance guarantees for AMF under regularity assumptions and demonstrate its empirical effectiveness to efficiently fine-tune neural policies in complex and high-dimensional environments.</p></details> |  |

Imagine the brain of a newborn or the controller of a baby humanoid robot trying to make sense of unprocessed sensorimotor time series. Here, we present a framework for studying the dynamic functional connectivity between the multimodal sensory signals of a robotic agent to uncover an underlying structure. Using instantaneous mutual information, we capture the time-varying functional connectivity (FC) between proprioceptive, tactile, and visual signals, revealing the sensorimotor relationships. Using an infinite relational model, we identified sensorimotor modules and their evolving connectivity. To further interpret these dynamic interactions, we employed non-negative matrix factorization, which decomposed the connectivity patterns into additive factors and their corresponding temporal coefficients. These factors can be considered the agent's motion primitives or movement synergies that the agent can use to make sense of its sensorimotor space and later for behavior selection. In the future, the method can be deployed in robot learning as well as in the analysis of human movement trajectories or brain signals.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages with 6 figures</p></details> |

Despite their promise, these models remain brittle when encountering novel visual distractors such as objects and background elements rarely seen during training. Specifically, novel distractors can corrupt action outcome predictions, causing downstream failures when robots rely on the world model imaginations for planning or action verification. In this work, we propose Reimagination with Observation Intervention (ReOI), a simple yet effective test-time strategy that enables world models to predict more reliable action outcomes in open-world scenarios where novel and unanticipated visual distractors are inevitable. Given the current robot observation, ReOI first detects visual distractors by identifying which elements of the scene degrade in physically implausible ways during world model prediction. Then, it modifies the current observation to remove these distractors and bring the observation closer to the training distribution. Finally, ReOI "reimagines" future outcomes with the modified observation and reintroduces the distractors post-hoc to preserve visual consistency for downstream planning and verification. We validate our approach on a suite of robotic manipulation tasks in the context of action verification, where the verifier needs to select desired action plans based on predictions from a world model. Our results show that ReOI is robust to both in-distribution and out-of-distribution visual distractors. Notably, it improves task success rates by up to 3x in the presence of novel distractors, significantly outperforming action verification that relies on world model predictions without imagination interventions.</p></details> |  |

DreamGen leverages state-of-the-art image-to-video generative models, adapting them to the target robot embodiment to produce photorealistic synthetic videos of familiar or novel tasks in diverse environments. Since these models generate only videos, we recover pseudo-action sequences using either a latent action model or an inverse-dynamics model (IDM). Despite its simplicity, DreamGen unlocks strong behavior and environment generalization: a humanoid robot can perform 22 new behaviors in both seen and unseen environments, while requiring teleoperation data from only a single pick-and-place task in one environment. To evaluate the pipeline systematically, we introduce DreamGen Bench, a video generation benchmark that shows a strong correlation between benchmark performance and downstream policy success. Our work establishes a promising new axis for scaling robot learning well beyond manual data collection.

In contrast, vast amounts of action-free video data are readily available, but translating these observations into effective policies remains a challenge. We introduce AMPLIFY, a novel framework that leverages large-scale video data by encoding visual dynamics into compact, discrete motion tokens derived from keypoint trajectories. Our modular approach separates visual motion prediction from action inference, decoupling the challenges of learning what motion defines a task from how robots can perform it. We train a forward dynamics model on abundant action-free videos and an inverse dynamics model on a limited set of action-labeled examples, allowing for independent scaling. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that the learned dynamics are both accurate, achieving up to 3.7x better MSE and over 2.5x better pixel prediction accuracy compared to prior approaches, and broadly useful. In downstream policy learning, our dynamics predictions enable a 1.2-2.2x improvement in low-data regimes, a 1.4x average improvement by learning from action-free human videos, and the first generalization to LIBERO tasks from zero in-distribution action data. Beyond robotic control, we find the dynamics learned by AMPLIFY to be a versatile latent world model, enhancing video prediction quality. Our results present a novel paradigm leveraging heterogeneous data sources to build efficient, generalizable world models.

| **[What Matters in Learning from Large-Scale Datasets for Robot Manipulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13536v1)** | 2025-06-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Imitation learning from large multi-task demonstration datasets has emerged as a promising path for building generally-capable robots. As a result, 1000s of hours have been spent on building such large-scale datasets around the globe. Despite the continuous growth of such efforts, we still lack a systematic understanding of what data should be collected to improve the utility of a robotics dataset and facilitate downstream policy learning. In this work, we conduct a large-scale dataset composition study to answer this question. We develop a data generation framework to procedurally emulate common sources of diversity in existing datasets (such as sensor placements and object types and arrangements), and use it to generate large-scale robot datasets with controlled compositions, enabling a suite of dataset composition studies that would be prohibitively expensive in the real world. We focus on two practical settings: (1) what types of diversity should be emphasized when future researchers collect large-scale datasets for robotics, and (2) how should current practitioners retrieve relevant demonstrations from existing datasets to maximize downstream policy performance on tasks of interest. Our study yields several critical insights -- for example, we find that camera poses and spatial arrangements are crucial dimensions for both diversity in collection and alignment in retrieval. In real-world robot learning settings, we find that not only do our insights from simulation carry over, but our retrieval strategies on existing datasets such as DROID allow us to consistently outperform existing training strategies by up to 70%.

| **[DoublyAware: Dual Planning and Policy Awareness for Temporal Difference Learning in Humanoid Locomotion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12095v1)** | 2025-06-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Achieving robust robot learning for humanoid locomotion is a fundamental challenge in model-based reinforcement learning (MBRL), where environmental stochasticity and randomness can hinder efficient exploration and learning stability. The environmental, so-called aleatoric, uncertainty can be amplified in high-dimensional action spaces with complex contact dynamics, and further entangled with epistemic uncertainty in the models during learning phases. In this work, we propose DoublyAware, an uncertainty-aware extension of Temporal Difference Model Predictive Control (TD-MPC) that explicitly decomposes uncertainty into two disjoint interpretable components, i.e., planning and policy uncertainties. To handle the planning uncertainty, DoublyAware employs conformal prediction to filter candidate trajectories using quantile-calibrated risk bounds, ensuring statistical consistency and robustness against stochastic dynamics. Meanwhile, policy rollouts are leveraged as structured informative priors to support the learning phase with Group-Relative Policy Constraint (GRPC) optimizers that impose a group-based adaptive trust-region in the latent action space. This principled combination enables the robot agent to prioritize high-confidence, high-reward behavior while maintaining effective, targeted exploration under uncertainty. Evaluated on the HumanoidBench locomotion suite with the Unitree 26-DoF H1-2 humanoid, DoublyAware demonstrates improved sample efficiency, accelerated convergence, and enhanced motion feasibility compared to RL baselines. Our simulation results emphasize the significance of structured uncertainty modeling for data-efficient and reliable decision-making in TD-MPC-based humanoid locomotion learning.</p></details> |  |

However, mastering complex manipulation tasks remains an open challenge, constrained by limitations in persistent contextual memory, multi-agent coordination under uncertainty, and dynamic long-horizon planning across variable sequences. To address this challenge, we propose \textbf{HiBerNAC}, a \textbf{Hi}erarchical \textbf{B}rain-\textbf{e}mulated \textbf{r}obotic \textbf{N}eural \textbf{A}gent \textbf{C}ollective, inspired by breakthroughs in neuroscience, particularly in neural circuit mechanisms and hierarchical decision-making. Our framework combines: (1) multimodal VLA planning and reasoning with (2) neuro-inspired reflection and multi-agent mechanisms, specifically designed for complex robotic manipulation tasks. By leveraging neuro-inspired functional modules with decentralized multi-agent collaboration, our approach enables robust and enhanced real-time execution of complex manipulation tasks. In addition, the agentic system exhibits scalable collective intelligence via dynamic agent specialization, adapting its coordination strategy to variable task horizons and complexity. Through extensive experiments on complex manipulation tasks compared with state-of-the-art VLA models, we demonstrate that \textbf{HiBerNAC} reduces average long-horizon task completion time by 23\%, and achieves non-zero success rates (12\textendash 31\%) on multi-path tasks where prior state-of-the-art VLA models consistently fail. These results provide indicative evidence for bridging biological cognition and robotic learning mechanisms.</p></details> | 31 pages,5 figures |

While deep learning architectures and foundation models have driven significant advances in diverse robotic applications, they remain limited in their ability to operate efficiently and reliably in unknown and dynamic environments. In this position paper, we critically assess these limitations and introduce a conceptual framework for combining data-driven learning with deliberate, structured reasoning. Specifically, we propose leveraging differentiable physics for efficient world modeling, Bayesian inference for uncertainty-aware decision-making, and meta-learning for rapid adaptation to new tasks. By embedding physical symbolic reasoning within neural models, robots could generalize beyond their training data, reason about novel situations, and continuously expand their knowledge. We argue that such hybrid neuro-symbolic architectures are essential for the next generation of autonomous systems, and to this end, we provide a research roadmap to guide and accelerate their development.</p></details> |  |

First, we introduce a novel gait planner that incorporates dynamics to design the desired joint trajectory. In the gait design process, the 3D robot model is decoupled into two 2D models, which are then approximated as hybrid inverted pendulums (H-LIP) for trajectory planning. The gait planner operates in parallel in real time within the robot's learning environment. Second, based on this gait planner, we design three effective reward functions within a reinforcement learning framework, forming a reward composition to achieve periodic bipedal gait. This reward composition reduces the robot's learning time and enhances locomotion performance. Finally, a gait design example and performance comparison are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.</p></details> |  |

Real robot data suffers from occlusions, noisy camera poses, dynamic scene elements, which hinder the creation of geometrically accurate and photorealistic digital twins of unseen objects. We introduce a novel real-to-sim framework tackling all these challenges at once. Our key insight is a hybrid scene representation merging the photorealistic rendering of 3D Gaussian Splatting with explicit object meshes suitable for physics simulation within a single representation. We propose an end-to-end optimization pipeline that leverages differentiable rendering and differentiable physics within MuJoCo to jointly refine all scene components - from object geometry and appearance to robot poses and physical parameters - directly from raw and imprecise robot trajectories. This unified optimization allows us to simultaneously achieve high-fidelity object mesh reconstruction, generate photorealistic novel views, and perform annotation-free robot pose calibration. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach both in simulation and on challenging real-world sequences using an ALOHA 2 bi-manual manipulator, enabling more practical and robust real-to-simulation pipelines.</p></details> | <details><summary>Updat...</summary><p>Updated version correcting inadvertent omission in author list</p></details> |

Leveraging prior knowledge has the potential to significantly enhance learning efficiency, which, however, raises two critical challenges: how to determine the relevancy of existing knowledge and how to adaptively integrate them into learning a new task. In this paper, we propose Context-aware Adaptation for Robot Learning (CARoL), a novel framework to efficiently learn a similar but distinct new task from prior knowledge. CARoL incorporates context awareness by analyzing state transitions in system dynamics to identify similarities between the new task and prior knowledge. It then utilizes these identified similarities to prioritize and adapt specific knowledge pieces for the new task. Additionally, CARoL has a broad applicability spanning policy-based, value-based, and actor-critic RL algorithms. We validate the efficiency and generalizability of CARoL on both simulated robotic platforms and physical ground vehicles. The simulations include CarRacing and LunarLander environments, where CARoL demonstrates faster convergence and higher rewards when learning policies for new tasks. In real-world experiments, we show that CARoL enables a ground vehicle to quickly and efficiently adapt policies learned in simulation to smoothly traverse real-world off-road terrain.</p></details> |  |

Table tennis serves as an ideal testbed for this problem, demanding both rapid interception of fast-moving balls and precise adjustment of their trajectories. This task presents two fundamental challenges: it requires a high-precision vision system capable of accurately predicting ball trajectories, and it necessitates intelligent strategic planning to ensure precise ball placement to target regions. The dynamic nature of table tennis, coupled with its real-time response requirements, makes it particularly well-suited for advancing robotic control capabilities in fast-paced, precision-critical domains. In this paper, we present SpikePingpong, a novel system that integrates spike-based vision with imitation learning for high-precision robotic table tennis. Our approach introduces two key attempts that directly address the aforementioned challenges: SONIC, a spike camera-based module that achieves millimeter-level precision in ball-racket contact prediction by compensating for real-world uncertainties such as air resistance and friction; and IMPACT, a strategic planning module that enables accurate ball placement to targeted table regions. The system harnesses a 20 kHz spike camera for high-temporal resolution ball tracking, combined with efficient neural network models for real-time trajectory correction and stroke planning. Experimental results demonstrate that SpikePingpong achieves a remarkable 91% success rate for 30 cm accuracy target area and 71% in the more challenging 20 cm accuracy task, surpassing previous state-of-the-art approaches by 38% and 37% respectively. These significant performance improvements enable the robust implementation of sophisticated tactical gameplay strategies, providing a new research perspective for robotic control in high-speed dynamic tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Self-Adapting Improvement Loops for Robotic Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06658v1)** | 2025-06-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video generative models trained on expert demonstrations have been utilized as performant text-conditioned visual planners for solving robotic tasks. However, generalization to unseen tasks remains a challenge. Whereas improved generalization may be facilitated by leveraging learned prior knowledge from additional pre-collected offline data sources, such as web-scale video datasets, in the era of experience we aim to design agents that can continuously improve in an online manner from self-collected behaviors. In this work we thus propose the Self-Adapting Improvement Loop (SAIL), where an in-domain video model iteratively updates itself on self-produced trajectories, collected through adaptation with an internet-scale pretrained video model, and steadily improves its performance for a specified task of interest. We apply SAIL to a diverse suite of MetaWorld tasks, as well as two manipulation tasks on a real robot arm, and find that performance improvements continuously emerge over multiple iterations for novel tasks initially unseen during original in-domain video model training. Furthermore, we discover that SAIL is surprisingly robust regarding if and how the self-collected experience is filtered, and the quality of the initial in-domain demonstrations. Through adaptation with summarized internet-scale data, and learning through online experience, we thus demonstrate a way to iteratively bootstrap a high-performance video model for solving novel robotic tasks through self-improvement.</p></details> |  |

Crafted by professional 3D modelers adhering to unified standards, ArtVIP ensures visual realism through precise geometric meshes and high-resolution textures, while physical fidelity is achieved via fine-tuned dynamic parameters. Meanwhile, the dataset pioneers embedded modular interaction behaviors within assets and pixel-level affordance annotations. Feature-map visualization and optical motion capture are employed to quantitatively demonstrate ArtVIP's visual and physical fidelity, with its applicability validated across imitation learning and reinforcement learning experiments.

In this work, we introduce visual trace prompting, a simple yet effective approach to facilitate VLA models' spatial-temporal awareness for action prediction by encoding state-action trajectories visually. We develop a new TraceVLA model by finetuning OpenVLA on our own collected dataset of 150K robot manipulation trajectories using visual trace prompting. Evaluations of TraceVLA across 137 configurations in SimplerEnv and 4 tasks on a physical WidowX robot demonstrate state-of-the-art performance, outperforming OpenVLA by 10% on SimplerEnv and 3.5x on real-robot tasks and exhibiting robust generalization across diverse embodiments and scenarios. To further validate the effectiveness and generality of our method, we present a compact VLA model based on 4B Phi-3-Vision, pretrained on the Open-X-Embodiment and finetuned on our dataset, rivals the 7B OpenVLA baseline while significantly improving inference efficiency.</p></details> |  |

We introduce the Quantum Decision Transformer (QDT), a novel architecture incorporating quantum-inspired computational mechanisms to address these challenges. Our approach integrates two core components: Quantum-Inspired Attention with entanglement operations that capture non-local feature correlations, and Quantum Feedforward Networks with multi-path processing and learnable interference for adaptive computation. Through comprehensive experiments on continuous control tasks, we demonstrate over 2,000\% performance improvement compared to standard DTs, with superior generalization across varying data qualities. Critically, our ablation studies reveal strong synergistic effects between quantum-inspired components: neither alone achieves competitive performance, yet their combination produces dramatic improvements far exceeding individual contributions. This synergy demonstrates that effective quantum-inspired architecture design requires holistic co-design of interdependent mechanisms rather than modular component adoption. Our analysis identifies three key computational advantages: enhanced credit assignment through non-local correlations, implicit ensemble behavior via parallel processing, and adaptive resource allocation through learnable interference. These findings establish quantum-inspired design principles as a promising direction for advancing transformer architectures in sequential decision-making, with implications extending beyond reinforcement learning to neural architecture design more broadly.</p></details> |  |

Single-objective Reinforcement Learning approaches typically address this by optimizing a fixed scalarized reward function, resulting in rigid policies that fail to adapt to varying clinical priorities. Multi-objective Reinforcement Learning (MORL) offers a solution by learning a set of optimal policies along the Pareto Frontier, allowing for dynamic preference selection at test time. However, applying MORL in healthcare necessitates strict offline learning from historical data. In this paper, we benchmark three offline MORL algorithms, Conditioned Conservative Pareto Q-Learning (CPQL), Adaptive CPQL, and a modified Pareto Efficient Decision Agent (PEDA) Decision Transformer (PEDA DT), against three scalarized single-objective baselines (BC, CQL, and DDQN) on the MIMIC-IV dataset. Using Off-Policy Evaluation (OPE) metrics, we demonstrate that PEDA DT algorithm offers superior flexibility compared to static scalarized baselines. Notably, our results extend previous findings on single-objective Decision Transformers in healthcare, confirming that sequence modeling architectures remain robust and effective when scaled to multi-objective conditioned generation. These findings suggest that offline MORL is a promising framework for enabling personalized, adjustable decision-making in critical care without the need for retraining.</p></details> |  |
| **[Data Fusion-Enhanced Decision Transformer for Stable Cross-Domain Generalization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09173v2)** | 2025-12-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Cross-domain shifts present a significant challenge for decision transformer (DT) policies. Existing cross-domain policy adaptation methods typically rely on a single simple filtering criterion to select source trajectory fragments and stitch them together. They match either state structure or action feasibility. However, the selected fragments still have poor stitchability: state structures can misalign, the return-to-go (RTG) becomes incomparable when the reward or horizon changes, and actions may jump at trajectory junctions. As a result, RTG tokens lose continuity, which compromises DT's inference ability. To tackle these challenges, we propose Data Fusion-Enhanced Decision Transformer (DFDT), a compact pipeline that restores stitchability. Particularly, DFDT fuses scarce target data with selectively trusted source fragments via a two-level data filter, maximum mean discrepancy (MMD) mismatch for state-structure alignment, and optimal transport (OT) deviation for action feasibility. It then trains on a feasibility-weighted fusion distribution. Furthermore, DFDT replaces RTG tokens with advantage-conditioned tokens, which improves the continuity of the semantics in the token sequence. It also applies a $Q$-guided regularizer to suppress junction value and action jumps. Theoretically, we provide bounds that tie state value and policy performance gaps to the MMD-mismatch and OT-deviation measures, and show that the bounds tighten as these two measures shrink. We show that DFDT improves return and stability over strong offline RL and sequence-model baselines across gravity, kinematic, and morphology shifts on D4RL-style control tasks, and further corroborate these gains with token-stitching and sequence-semantics stability analyses.</p></details> | 32 pages,4 figures |
| **[Hybrid Quantum-Classical Ensemble Learning for S\&P 500 Directional Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15738v1)** | 2025-12-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Financial market prediction is a challenging application of machine learning, where even small improvements in directional accuracy can yield substantial value. Most models struggle to exceed 55--57\% accuracy due to high noise, non-stationarity, and market efficiency. We introduce a hybrid ensemble framework combining quantum sentiment analysis, Decision Transformer architecture, and strategic model selection, achieving 60.14\% directional accuracy on S\&P 500 prediction, a 3.10\% improvement over individual models. Our framework addresses three limitations of prior approaches. First, architecture diversity dominates dataset diversity: combining different learning algorithms (LSTM, Decision Transformer, XGBoost, Random Forest, Logistic Regression) on the same data outperforms training identical architectures on multiple datasets (60.14\% vs.\ 52.80\%), confirmed by correlation analysis ($r>0.6$ among same-architecture models). Second, a 4-qubit variational quantum circuit enhances sentiment analysis, providing +0.8\% to +1.5\% gains per model. Third, smart filtering excludes weak predictors (accuracy $<52\%$), improving ensemble performance (Top-7 models: 60.14\% vs.\ all 35 models: 51.2\%). We evaluate on 2020--2023 market data across seven instruments, covering diverse regimes including the COVID-19 crash and inflation-driven correction. McNemar's test confirms statistical significance ($p<0.05$). Preliminary backtesting with confidence-based filtering (6+ model consensus) yields a Sharpe ratio of 1.2 versus buy-and-hold's 0.8, demonstrating practical trading potential.</p></details> |  |
| **[Pre-trained Language Models Improve the Few-shot Prompt Ability of Decision Transformer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01402v2)** | 2025-12-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Decision Transformer (DT) has emerged as a promising class of algorithms in offline reinforcement learning (RL) tasks, leveraging pre-collected datasets and Transformer's capability to model long sequences. Recent works have demonstrated that using parts of trajectories from training tasks as prompts in DT enhances its performance on unseen tasks, giving rise to Prompt-DT methods. However, collecting data from specific environments can be both costly and unsafe in many scenarios, leading to suboptimal performance and limited few-shot prompt abilities due to the data-hungry nature of Transformer-based models. Additionally, the limited datasets used in pre-training make it challenging for Prompt-DT type of methods to distinguish between various RL tasks through prompts alone. To address these challenges, we introduce the Language model-initialized Prompt Decision Transformer (LPDT) framework, which leverages pretrained language models providing rich prior knowledge for RL tasks and fine-tunes the sequence model using Low-rank Adaptation (LoRA) for meta-RL problems. We further incorporate prompt regularization to effectively differentiate between tasks based on prompt feature representations. Comprehensive empirical studies demonstrate that initializing with a pre-trained language model provides the prior knowledge and achieves a similar performance with Prompt-DT under only $10\%$ data in some MuJoCo control tasks. We also provide a thorough ablation study to validate the effectiveness of each component, including sequence modeling, language models, prompt regularizations, and prompt strategies.</p></details> | <details><summary>2 fig...</summary><p>2 figures, 10 tables.

These models are trained on fleet movement data, including robot positions, goals, and interactions, from hundreds of thousands of robots in Amazon warehouses worldwide. DeepFleet consists of four architectures that each embody a distinct inductive bias and collectively explore key points in the design space for multi-agent foundation models: the robot-centric (RC) model is an autoregressive decision transformer operating on neighborhoods of individual robots; the robot-floor (RF) model uses a transformer with cross-attention between robots and the warehouse floor; the image-floor (IF) model applies convolutional encoding to a multi-channel image representation of the full fleet; and the graph-floor (GF) model combines temporal attention with graph neural networks for spatial relationships. In this paper, we describe these models and present our evaluation of the impact of these design choices on prediction task performance. We find that the robot-centric and graph-floor models, which both use asynchronous robot state updates and incorporate the localized structure of robot interactions, show the most promise. We also present experiments that show that these two models can make effective use of larger warehouses operation datasets as the models are scaled up.</p></details> | <details><summary>27 pa...</summary><p>27 pages, 10 figures, 2 tables</p></details> |
| **[A Comparison Between Decision Transformers and Traditional Offline Reinforcement Learning Algorithms](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16475v1)** | 2025-11-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The field of Offline Reinforcement Learning (RL) aims to derive effective policies from pre-collected datasets without active environment interaction. While traditional offline RL algorithms like Conservative Q-Learning (CQL) and Implicit Q-Learning (IQL) have shown promise, they often face challenges in balancing exploration and exploitation, especially in environments with varying reward densities. The recently proposed Decision Transformer (DT) approach, which reframes offline RL as a sequence modelling problem, has demonstrated impressive results across various benchmarks. This paper presents a comparative study evaluating the performance of DT against traditional offline RL algorithms in dense and sparse reward settings for the ANT continous control environment. Our research investigates how these algorithms perform when faced with different reward structures, examining their ability to learn effective policies and generalize across varying levels of feedback. Through empirical analysis in the ANT environment, we found that DTs showed less sensitivity to varying reward density compared to other methods and particularly excelled with medium-expert datasets in sparse reward scenarios. In contrast, traditional value-based methods like IQL showed improved performance in dense reward settings with high-quality data, while CQL offered balanced performance across different data qualities. Additionally, DTs exhibited lower variance in performance but required significantly more computational resources compared to traditional approaches. These findings suggest that sequence modelling approaches may be more suitable for scenarios with uncertain reward structures or mixed-quality data, while value-based methods remain competitive in settings with dense rewards and high-quality demonstrations.</p></details> | <details><summary>15 pa...</summary><p>15 pages, 4 figures, published in the Proceedings of the 46th Annual conference of the South African Institute of Computer Scientists and Information Technologists (SIACSIT 2025)</p></details> |
| **[Toward Explainable Offline RL: Analyzing Representations in Intrinsically Motivated Decision Transformers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13958v2)** | 2025-11-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Elastic Decision Transformers (EDTs) have proved to be particularly successful in offline reinforcement learning, offering a flexible framework that unifies sequence modeling with decision-making under uncertainty. Recent research has shown that incorporating intrinsic motivation mechanisms into EDTs improves performance across exploration tasks, yet the representational mechanisms underlying these improvements remain unexplored. In this paper, we introduce a systematic post-hoc explainability framework to analyze how intrinsic motivation shapes learned embeddings in EDTs. Through statistical analysis of embedding properties (including covariance structure, vector magnitudes, and orthogonality), we reveal that different intrinsic motivation variants create fundamentally different representational structures. Our analysis demonstrates environment-specific correlation patterns between embedding metrics and performance that explain why intrinsic motivation improves policy learning. These findings show that intrinsic motivation operates beyond simple exploration bonuses, acting as a representational prior that shapes embedding geometry in biologically plausible ways, creating environment-specific organizational structures that facilitate better decision-making.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for poster presentation at the NeurIPS 2025 workshop "CogInterp: Interpreting Cognition in Deep Learning Models", San Diego, CA, USA</p></details> |
| **[Soft Conflict-Resolution Decision Transformer for Offline Multi-Task Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13133v1)** | 2025-11-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-task reinforcement learning (MTRL) seeks to learn a unified policy for diverse tasks, but often suffers from gradient conflicts across tasks. Existing masking-based methods attempt to mitigate such conflicts by assigning task-specific parameter masks. However, our empirical study shows that coarse-grained binary masks have the problem of over-suppressing key conflicting parameters, hindering knowledge sharing across tasks. Moreover, different tasks exhibit varying conflict levels, yet existing methods use a one-size-fits-all fixed sparsity strategy to keep training stability and performance, which proves inadequate. These limitations hinder the model's generalization and learning efficiency. To address these issues, we propose SoCo-DT, a Soft Conflict-resolution method based by parameter importance. By leveraging Fisher information, mask values are dynamically adjusted to retain important parameters while suppressing conflicting ones. In addition, we introduce a dynamic sparsity adjustment strategy based on the Interquartile Range (IQR), which constructs task-specific thresholding schemes using the distribution of conflict and harmony scores during training. To enable adaptive sparsity evolution throughout training, we further incorporate an asymmetric cosine annealing schedule to continuously update the threshold. Experimental results on the Meta-World benchmark show that SoCo-DT outperforms the state-of-the-art method by 7.6% on MT50 and by 10.5% on the suboptimal dataset, demonstrating its effectiveness in mitigating gradient conflicts and improving overall multi-task performance.</p></details> |  |

While ARC has inspired extensive research on abstract reasoning, most existing approaches rely on static input--output supervision, which limits insight into how reasoning unfolds over time. ARCTraj addresses this gap by recording temporally ordered, object-level actions that capture how humans iteratively transform inputs into outputs, revealing intermediate reasoning steps that conventional datasets overlook. Collected via the O2ARC web interface, it contains around 10,000 trajectories annotated with task identifiers, timestamps, and success labels across 400 training tasks from the ARC-AGI-1 benchmark. It further defines a unified reasoning pipeline encompassing data collection, action abstraction, Markov decision process (MDP) formulation, and downstream learning, enabling integration with reinforcement learning, generative modeling, and sequence modeling methods such as PPO, World Models, GFlowNets, Diffusion agents, and Decision Transformers. Analyses of spatial selection, color attribution, and strategic convergence highlight the structure and diversity of human reasoning. Together, these contributions position ARCTraj as a structured and interpretable foundation for studying human-like reasoning, advancing explainability, alignment, and generalizable intelligence.</p></details> |  |

These algorithms performed competitively across various benchmarks, from games to robotic tasks, but their theoretical understanding is limited to specific environmental conditions. This work initiates a theoretical foundation for algorithms that build on the broad paradigm of approaching reinforcement learning through supervised learning or sequence modeling. At the core of this investigation lies the analysis of conditions on the underlying environment, under which the algorithms can identify optimal solutions. We also assess whether emerging solutions remain stable in situations where the environment is subject to tiny levels of noise. Specifically, we study the continuity and asymptotic convergence of command-conditioned policies, values and the goal-reaching objective depending on the transition kernel of the underlying Markov Decision Process. We demonstrate that near-optimal behavior is achieved if the transition kernel is located in a sufficiently small neighborhood of a deterministic kernel. The mentioned quantities are continuous (with respect to a specific topology) at deterministic kernels, both asymptotically and after a finite number of learning cycles. The developed methods allow us to present the first explicit estimates on the convergence and stability of policies and values in terms of the underlying transition kernels. On the theoretical side we introduce a number of new concepts to reinforcement learning, like working in segment spaces, studying continuity in quotient topologies and the application of the fixed-point theory of dynamical systems. The theoretical study is accompanied by a detailed investigation of example environments and numerical experiments.</p></details> | <details><summary>85 pa...</summary><p>85 pages in main text + 4 pages of references + 26 pages of appendices, 12 figures in main text + 2 figures in appendices; source code available at https://github.com/struplm/eUDRL-GCSL-ODT-Convergence-public</p></details> |
| **[Unified token representations for sequential decision models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21448v1)** | 2025-10-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Transformers have demonstrated strong potential in offline reinforcement learning (RL) by modeling trajectories as sequences of return-to-go, states, and actions. However, existing approaches such as the Decision Transformer(DT) and its variants suffer from redundant tokenization and quadratic attention complexity, limiting their scalability in real-time or resource-constrained settings. To address this, we propose a Unified Token Representation (UTR) that merges return-to-go, state, and action into a single token, substantially reducing sequence length and model complexity. Theoretical analysis shows that UTR leads to a tighter Rademacher complexity bound, suggesting improved generalization. We further develop two variants: UDT and UDC, built upon transformer and gated CNN backbones, respectively. Both achieve comparable or superior performance to state-of-the-art methods with markedly lower computation. These findings demonstrate that UTR generalizes well across architectures and may provide an efficient foundation for scalable control in future large decision models.</p></details> |  |

Modern decision Transformers - trained similarly to LLMs - are able to learn competent gameplay, but it is unclear to what extent they truly capture the rules of chess. To investigate this, we train a 270M parameter chess Transformer and test it on out-of-distribution scenarios, designed to reveal failures of systematic generalization. Our analysis shows that Transformers exhibit compositional generalization, as evidenced by strong rule extrapolation: they adhere to fundamental syntactic rules of the game by consistently choosing valid moves even in situations very different from the training data. Moreover, they also generate high-quality moves for OOD puzzles. In a more challenging test, we evaluate the models on variants including Chess960 (Fischer Random Chess) - a variant of chess where starting positions of pieces are randomized. We found that while the model exhibits basic strategy adaptation, they are inferior to symbolic AI algorithms that perform explicit search, but gap is smaller when playing against users on Lichess. Moreover, the training dynamics revealed that the model initially learns to move only its own pieces, suggesting an emergent compositional understanding of the game.</p></details> |  |

The tasks share a common structure and an algorithm should exploit the shared structure to minimize the cumulative regret for an unseen but related test task. We use a transformer as a decision-making algorithm to learn this shared structure from data collected by a demonstrator on a set of training task instances. Our objective is to devise a training procedure such that the transformer will learn to outperform the demonstrator's learning algorithm on unseen test task instances. Prior work on pretraining decision transformers either requires privileged information like access to optimal arms or cannot outperform the demonstrator. Going beyond these approaches, we introduce a pre-training approach that trains a transformer network to learn a near-optimal policy in-context. This approach leverages the shared structure across tasks, does not require access to optimal actions, and can outperform the demonstrator. We validate these claims over a wide variety of structured bandit problems to show that our proposed solution is general and can quickly identify expected rewards on unseen test tasks to support effective exploration.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in Reinforcement Learning Conference 2025</p></details> |

Yet, the adversarial robustness of reinforcement learning methods based on sequence modeling remains largely unexplored. Here we introduce the Conservative Adversarially Robust Decision Transformer (CART), to our knowledge the first framework designed to enhance the robustness of DT in adversarial stochastic games. We formulate the interaction between the protagonist and the adversary at each stage as a stage game, where the payoff is defined as the expected maximum value over subsequent states, thereby explicitly incorporating stochastic state transitions. By conditioning Transformer policies on the NashQ value derived from these stage games, CART generates policy that are simultaneously less exploitable (adversarially robust) and conservative to transition uncertainty. Empirically, CART achieves more accurate minimax value estimation and consistently attains superior worst-case returns across a range of adversarial stochastic games.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by Reliable ML Workshop @ NeurIPS 2025</p></details> |

In this paper, we introduce MDT4Rec, an offline RLRS framework that builds on the Decision Transformer (DT) to address two major challenges: learning from sub-optimal histories and representing complex user-item interactions. First, MDT4Rec shifts the trajectory stitching procedure from the training phase to action inference, allowing the system to shorten its historical context when necessary and thereby ignore negative or unsuccessful past experiences. Second, MDT4Rec initializes DT with a pre-trained large language model (LLM) for knowledge transfer, replaces linear embedding layers with Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs) for more flexible representations, and employs Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) to efficiently fine-tune only a small subset of parameters. We evaluate MDT4Rec on five public datasets and in an online simulation environment, demonstrating that it outperforms existing methods.</p></details> | CIKM'25 |
| **[Adjusting the Output of Decision Transformer with Action Gradient](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05285v1)** | 2025-10-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Decision Transformer (DT), which integrates reinforcement learning (RL) with the transformer model, introduces a novel approach to offline RL. Unlike classical algorithms that take maximizing cumulative discounted rewards as objective, DT instead maximizes the likelihood of actions. This paradigm shift, however, presents two key challenges: stitching trajectories and extrapolation of action. Existing methods, such as substituting specific tokens with predictive values and integrating the Policy Gradient (PG) method, address these challenges individually but fail to improve performance stably when combined due to inherent instability. To address this, we propose Action Gradient (AG), an innovative methodology that directly adjusts actions to fulfill a function analogous to that of PG, while also facilitating efficient integration with token prediction techniques. AG utilizes the gradient of the Q-value with respect to the action to optimize the action. The empirical results demonstrate that our method can significantly enhance the performance of DT-based algorithms, with some results achieving state-of-the-art levels.</p></details> |  |

The Prompting Decision Transformer (PDT) enables task generalization via trajectory prompts sampled uniformly from expert demonstrations -- without accounting for prompt informativeness. In this work, we propose a bandit-based prompt-tuning method that learns to construct optimal trajectory prompts from demonstration data at inference time. We devise a structured bandit architecture operating in the trajectory prompt space, achieving linear rather than combinatorial scaling with prompt size. Additionally, we show that the pre-trained PDT itself can serve as a powerful feature extractor for the bandit, enabling efficient reward modeling across various environments. We theoretically establish regret bounds and demonstrate empirically that our method consistently enhances performance across a wide range of tasks, high-dimensional environments, and out-of-distribution scenarios, outperforming existing baselines in prompt tuning.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at NeurIPS 2025</p></details> |

Therefore, we propose an effective two-stage learning from demonstrations training framework, FISHER, to highlight the adaptability of reinforcement learning (RL) methods in the multi-AUV underwater target tracking task, while addressing its limitations such as extensive requirements for environmental interactions and the challenges in designing reward functions. The first stage utilizes imitation learning (IL) to realize policy improvement and generate offline datasets. To be specific, we introduce multi-agent discriminator-actor-critic based on improvements of the generative adversarial IL algorithm and multi-agent IL optimization objective derived from the Nash equilibrium condition. Then in the second stage, we develop multi-agent independent generalized decision transformer, which analyzes the latent representation to match the future states of high-quality samples rather than reward function, attaining further enhanced policies capable of handling various scenarios. Besides, we propose a simulation to simulation demonstration generation procedure to facilitate the generation of expert demonstrations in underwater environments, which capitalizes on traditional control methods and can easily accomplish the domain transfer to obtain demonstrations. Extensive simulation experiments from multiple scenarios showcase that FISHER possesses strong stability, multi-task performance and capability of generalization.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been accepted by IEEE Transactions on Mobile Computing.

Most existing methods primarily focus on training policies that maximize cumulative returns from a given dataset. However, many real-world applications require precise control over policy performance levels, rather than simply pursuing the best possible return. Reinforcement learning via supervised learning (RvS) frames offline RL as a sequence modeling task, enabling the extraction of diverse policies by conditioning on different desired returns. Yet, existing RvS-based transformers, such as Decision Transformer (DT), struggle to reliably align the actual achieved returns with specified target returns, especially when interpolating within underrepresented returns or extrapolating beyond the dataset. To address this limitation, we propose Doctor, a novel approach that Double Checks the Transformer with target alignment for Offline RL. Doctor integrates the strengths of supervised learning (SL) and temporal difference (TD) learning by jointly optimizing the action prediction and value estimation. During inference, Doctor introduces a double-check mechanism: actions are first sampled around the desired target returns and then validated with value functions. This ensures more accurate alignment between predicted actions and desired target returns. We evaluate Doctor on the D4RL and EpiCare benchmarks, demonstrating aligned control yields stronger performance and tunable expertise, showing its effectiveness in a wide range of tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Multi-Agent Path Finding via Offline RL and LLM Collaboration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22130v1)** | 2025-09-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-Agent Path Finding (MAPF) poses a significant and challenging problem critical for applications in robotics and logistics, particularly due to its combinatorial complexity and the partial observability inherent in realistic environments. Decentralized reinforcement learning methods commonly encounter two substantial difficulties: first, they often yield self-centered behaviors among agents, resulting in frequent collisions, and second, their reliance on complex communication modules leads to prolonged training times, sometimes spanning weeks. To address these challenges, we propose an efficient decentralized planning framework based on the Decision Transformer (DT), uniquely leveraging offline reinforcement learning to substantially reduce training durations from weeks to mere hours. Crucially, our approach effectively handles long-horizon credit assignment and significantly improves performance in scenarios with sparse and delayed rewards. Furthermore, to overcome adaptability limitations inherent in standard RL methods under dynamic environmental changes, we integrate a large language model (GPT-4o) to dynamically guide agent policies. Extensive experiments in both static and dynamically changing environments demonstrate that our DT-based approach, augmented briefly by GPT-4o, significantly enhances adaptability and performance.</p></details> |  |

This study introduces GNN-DT, a novel Decision Transformer (DT) architecture that integrates Graph Neural Network (GNN) embedders with a novel residual connection between input and output tokens crucial for handling dynamic environments. By learning from previously collected trajectories, GNN-DT tackles the sparse rewards limitations of online RL algorithms and delivers high-quality solutions in real-time. We evaluate GNN-DT on the complex electric vehicle (EV) charging optimization problem and prove that its performance is superior and requires significantly fewer training trajectories, thus improving sample efficiency compared to existing DT and offline RL baselines. Furthermore, GNN-DT exhibits robust generalization to unseen environments and larger action spaces, addressing a critical gap in prior offline and online RL approaches.</p></details> |  |
| **[Large Language Model-Empowered Decision Transformer for UAV-Enabled Data Collection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13934v2)** | 2025-09-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The deployment of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) for reliable and energy-efficient data collection from spatially distributed devices holds great promise in supporting diverse Internet of Things (IoT) applications. Nevertheless, the limited endurance and communication range of UAVs necessitate intelligent trajectory planning. While reinforcement learning (RL) has been extensively explored for UAV trajectory optimization, its interactive nature entails high costs and risks in real-world environments. Offline RL mitigates these issues but remains susceptible to unstable training and heavily rely on expert-quality datasets. To address these challenges, we formulate a joint UAV trajectory planning and resource allocation problem to maximize energy efficiency of data collection. The resource allocation subproblem is first transformed into an equivalent linear programming formulation and solved optimally with polynomial-time complexity. Then, we propose a large language model (LLM)-empowered critic-regularized decision transformer (DT) framework, termed LLM-CRDT, to learn effective UAV control policies. In LLM-CRDT, we incorporate critic networks to regularize the DT model training, thereby integrating the sequence modeling capabilities of DT with critic-based value guidance to enable learning effective policies from suboptimal datasets. Furthermore, to mitigate the data-hungry nature of transformer models, we employ a pre-trained LLM as the transformer backbone of the DT model and adopt a parameter-efficient fine-tuning strategy, i.e., LoRA, enabling rapid adaptation to UAV control tasks with small-scale dataset and low computational overhead. Extensive simulations demonstrate that LLM-CRDT outperforms benchmark online and offline RL methods, achieving up to 36.7\% higher energy efficiency than the current state-of-the-art DT approaches.</p></details> | 14pages, 8 figures |
| **[Mental Accounts for Actions: EWA-Inspired Attention in Decision Transformers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15498v1)** | 2025-09-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Transformers have emerged as a compelling architecture for sequential decision-making by modeling trajectories via self-attention. In reinforcement learning (RL), they enable return-conditioned control without relying on value function approximation. Decision Transformers (DTs) exploit this by casting RL as supervised sequence modeling, but they are restricted to offline data and lack exploration. Online Decision Transformers (ODTs) address this limitation through entropy-regularized training on on-policy rollouts, offering a stable alternative to traditional RL methods like Soft Actor-Critic, which depend on bootstrapped targets and reward shaping. Despite these advantages, ODTs use standard attention, which lacks explicit memory of action-specific outcomes. This leads to inefficiencies in learning long-term action effectiveness. Inspired by cognitive models such as Experience-Weighted Attraction (EWA), we propose Experience-Weighted Attraction with Vector Quantization for Online Decision Transformers (EWA-VQ-ODT), a lightweight module that maintains per-action mental accounts summarizing recent successes and failures. Continuous actions are routed via direct grid lookup to a compact vector-quantized codebook, where each code stores a scalar attraction updated online through decay and reward-based reinforcement. These attractions modulate attention by biasing the columns associated with action tokens, requiring no change to the backbone or training objective. On standard continuous-control benchmarks, EWA-VQ-ODT improves sample efficiency and average return over ODT, particularly in early training. The module is computationally efficient, interpretable via per-code traces, and supported by theoretical guarantees that bound the attraction dynamics and its impact on attention drift.</p></details> |  |

However, it struggles to learn optimal policies from suboptimal, reward-labelled trajectories. In this study, we explore the use of conditional generative modelling to facilitate trajectory stitching given its high-quality data generation ability. Additionally, recent advancements in Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) have shown their linear complexity and competitive sequence modelling performance over Transformers. We leverage the Test-Time Training (TTT) layer, an RNN that updates hidden states during testing, to model trajectories in the form of DT. We introduce a unified framework, called Diffusion-Refined Decision TTT (DRDT3), to achieve performance beyond DT models. Specifically, we propose the Decision TTT (DT3) module, which harnesses the sequence modelling strengths of both self-attention and the TTT layer to capture recent contextual information and make coarse action predictions. DRDT3 iteratively refines the coarse action predictions through the generative diffusion model, progressively moving closer to the optimal actions. We further integrate DT3 with the diffusion model using a unified optimization objective. With experiments on multiple tasks in the D4RL benchmark, our DT3 model without diffusion refinement demonstrates improved performance over standard DT, while DRDT3 further achieves superior results compared to state-of-the-art DT-based and offline RL methods.</p></details> |  |

We also test if we can accelerate the novelty-based training of these larger models by seeding the training with a pretrained models. The experimental results were mixed. NS-ES showed progress, but it would clearly need many more iterations for it to yield interesting agents. NSR-ES, on the other hand, proved quite capable of being straightforwardly used on larger models, since its performance appears as similar between the feed-forward model and Decision Transformer, as it was for the OpenAI-ES in our previous work.</p></details> |  |
| **[An Uncertainty-Weighted Decision Transformer for Navigation in Dense, Complex Driving Scenarios](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13132v1)** | 2025-09-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Autonomous driving in dense, dynamic environments requires decision-making systems that can exploit both spatial structure and long-horizon temporal dependencies while remaining robust to uncertainty. This work presents a novel framework that integrates multi-channel bird's-eye-view occupancy grids with transformer-based sequence modeling for tactical driving in complex roundabout scenarios. To address the imbalance between frequent low-risk states and rare safety-critical decisions, we propose the Uncertainty-Weighted Decision Transformer (UWDT). UWDT employs a frozen teacher transformer to estimate per-token predictive entropy, which is then used as a weight in the student model's loss function. This mechanism amplifies learning from uncertain, high-impact states while maintaining stability across common low-risk transitions. Experiments in a roundabout simulator, across varying traffic densities, show that UWDT consistently outperforms other baselines in terms of reward, collision rate, and behavioral stability. The results demonstrate that uncertainty-aware, spatial-temporal transformers can deliver safer and more efficient decision-making for autonomous driving in complex traffic environments.</p></details> |  |
| **[Kalman Bayesian Transformer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10695v1)** | 2025-09-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Sequential fine-tuning of transformers is useful when new data arrive sequentially, especially with shifting distributions. Unlike batch learning, sequential learning demands that training be stabilized despite a small amount of data by balancing new information and previously learned knowledge in the pre-trained models. This challenge is further complicated when training is to be completed in latency-critical environments and learning must additionally quantify and be mediated by uncertainty. Motivated by these challenges, we propose a novel method that frames sequential fine-tuning as a posterior inference problem within a Bayesian framework. Our approach integrates closed-form moment propagation of random variables, Kalman Bayesian Neural Networks, and Taylor approximations of the moments of softmax functions. By explicitly accounting for pre-trained models as priors and adaptively balancing them against new information based on quantified uncertainty, our method achieves robust and data-efficient sequential learning. The effectiveness of our method is demonstrated through numerical simulations involving sequential adaptation of a decision transformer to tasks characterized by distribution shifts and limited memory resources.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to the 64th IEEE Conference on Decision and Control (CDC 2025)</p></details> |

In our work, we propose a novel solution - the Progressive Prompt Decision Transformer (P2DT). This method enhances a transformer-based model by dynamically appending decision tokens during new task training, thus fostering task-specific policies. Our approach mitigates forgetting in continual and offline reinforcement learning scenarios. Moreover, P2DT leverages trajectories collected via traditional reinforcement learning from all tasks and generates new task-specific tokens during training, thereby retaining knowledge from previous studies. Preliminary results demonstrate that our model effectively alleviates catastrophic forgetting and scales well with increasing task environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by the 49th IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing (ICASSP 2024)</p></details> |

Optimizing their delivery involves addressing complex sequential decision-making challenges under constraints such as message utility and user fatigue. Offline reinforcement learning (RL) methods, such as Conservative Q-Learning (CQL), have been applied to this problem but face practical challenges at scale, including instability, sensitivity to distribution shifts, limited reproducibility, and difficulties with explainability in high-dimensional recommendation settings. We present a Decision Transformer (DT) based framework that reframes policy learning as return-conditioned supervised learning, improving robustness, scalability, and modeling flexibility. Our contributions include a real-world comparison with CQL, a multi-reward design suitable for non-episodic tasks, a quantile regression approach to return-to-go conditioning, and a production-ready system with circular buffer-based sequence processing for near-real-time inference. Extensive offline and online experiments in a deployed notification system show that our approach improves notification utility and overall session activity while minimizing user fatigue. Compared to a multi-objective CQL-based agent, the DT-based approach achieved a +0.72% increase in sessions for notification decision-making at LinkedIn by making notification recommendation more relevant.</p></details> |  |
| **[Learning to Ask: Decision Transformers for Adaptive Quantitative Group Testing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01723v1)** | 2025-09-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We consider the problem of quantitative group testing (QGT), where the goal is to recover a sparse binary vector from aggregate subset-sum queries: each query selects a subset of indices and returns the sum of those entries. Information-theoretic results suggest that adaptivity could yield up to a twofold reduction in the total number of required queries, yet no algorithm has surpassed the non-adaptive bound, leaving its practical benefit an open question. In this paper, we reduce the QGT problem to an integer-vector recovery task whose dimension scales with the sparsity of the original problem rather than its full ambient size. We then formulate this reduced recovery task as an offline reinforcement learning problem and employ Decision Transformers to solve it adaptively. By combining these two steps, we obtain an effective end-to-end method for solving the QGT problem. Our experiments show that, for the first time in the literature, our adaptive algorithm reduces the average number of queries below the well-known non-adaptive information-theoretic bound, demonstrating that adaptivity can indeed reduce the number of queries.</p></details> |  |

Spiking neural networks promise ultra-low-power, event-driven inference, yet no prior work has seamlessly merged spiking dynamics with return-conditioned sequence modeling. We present the Spiking Decision Transformer (SNN-DT), which embeds Leaky Integrate-and-Fire neurons into each self-attention block, trains end-to-end via surrogate gradients, and incorporates biologically inspired three-factor plasticity, phase-shifted spike-based positional encodings, and a lightweight dendritic routing module. Our implementation matches or exceeds standard Decision Transformer performance on classic control benchmarks (CartPole-v1, MountainCar-v0, Acrobot-v1, Pendulum-v1) while emitting fewer than ten spikes per decision, an energy proxy suggesting over four orders-of-magnitude reduction in per inference energy. By marrying sequence modeling with neuromorphic efficiency, SNN-DT opens a pathway toward real-time, low-power control on embedded and wearable devices.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint (31 pages, 19 images, 7 tables)</p></details> |
| **[Re:Frame -- Retrieving Experience From Associative Memory](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19344v1)** | 2025-08-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Offline reinforcement learning (RL) often deals with suboptimal data when collecting large expert datasets is unavailable or impractical. This limitation makes it difficult for agents to generalize and achieve high performance, as they must learn primarily from imperfect or inconsistent trajectories. A central challenge is therefore how to best leverage scarce expert demonstrations alongside abundant but lower-quality data. We demonstrate that incorporating even a tiny amount of expert experience can substantially improve RL agent performance. We introduce Re:Frame (Retrieving Experience From Associative Memory), a plug-in module that augments a standard offline RL policy (e.g., Decision Transformer) with a small external Associative Memory Buffer (AMB) populated by expert trajectories drawn from a separate dataset. During training on low-quality data, the policy learns to retrieve expert data from the Associative Memory Buffer (AMB) via content-based associations and integrate them into decision-making; the same AMB is queried at evaluation. This requires no environment interaction and no modifications to the backbone architecture. On D4RL MuJoCo tasks, using as few as 60 expert trajectories (0.1% of a 6000-trajectory dataset), Re:Frame consistently improves over a strong Decision Transformer baseline in three of four settings, with gains up to +10.7 normalized points. These results show that Re:Frame offers a simple and data-efficient way to inject scarce expert knowledge and substantially improve offline RL from low-quality datasets.</p></details> | 11 pages, 3 figures |
| **[GPG-HT: Generalized Policy Gradient with History-Aware Decision Transformer for Probabilistic Path Planning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17218v1)** | 2025-08-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the rapidly increased number of vehicles in urban areas, existing road infrastructure struggles to accommodate modern traffic demands, resulting in the issue of congestion. This highlights the importance of efficient path planning strategies. However, most recent navigation models focus solely on deterministic or time-dependent networks, while overlooking the correlations and the stochastic nature of traffic flows. In this work, we address the reliable shortest path problem within stochastic transportation networks under certain dependencies. We propose a path planning solution that integrates the decision Transformer with the Generalized Policy Gradient (GPG) framework. Based on the decision Transformer's capability to model long-term dependencies, our proposed solution improves the accuracy and stability of path decisions. Experimental results on the Sioux Falls Network (SFN) demonstrate that our approach outperforms previous baselines in terms of on-time arrival probability, providing more accurate path planning solutions.</p></details> |  |
| **[Toward Deployable Multi-Robot Collaboration via a Symbolically-Guided Decision Transformer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13877v1)** | 2025-08-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement learning (RL) has demonstrated great potential in robotic operations. However, its data-intensive nature and reliance on the Markov Decision Process (MDP) assumption limit its practical deployment in real-world scenarios involving complex dynamics and long-term temporal dependencies, such as multi-robot manipulation. Decision Transformers (DTs) have emerged as a promising offline alternative by leveraging causal transformers for sequence modeling in RL tasks. However, their applications to multi-robot manipulations still remain underexplored. To address this gap, we propose a novel framework, Symbolically-Guided Decision Transformer (SGDT), which integrates a neuro-symbolic mechanism with a causal transformer to enable deployable multi-robot collaboration. In the proposed SGDT framework, a neuro-symbolic planner generates a high-level task-oriented plan composed of symbolic subgoals. Guided by these subgoals, a goal-conditioned decision transformer (GCDT) performs low-level sequential decision-making for multi-robot manipulation. This hierarchical architecture enables structured, interpretable, and generalizable decision making in complex multi-robot collaboration tasks. We evaluate the performance of SGDT across a range of task scenarios, including zero-shot and few-shot scenarios. To our knowledge, this is the first work to explore DT-based technology for multi-robot manipulation.</p></details> |  |
| **[TADT-CSA: Temporal Advantage Decision Transformer with Contrastive State Abstraction for Generative Recommendation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20327v2)** | 2025-08-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the rapid advancement of Transformer-based Large Language Models (LLMs), generative recommendation has shown great potential in enhancing both the accuracy and semantic understanding of modern recommender systems. Compared to LLMs, the Decision Transformer (DT) is a lightweight generative model applied to sequential recommendation tasks. However, DT faces challenges in trajectory stitching, often producing suboptimal trajectories. Moreover, due to the high dimensionality of user states and the vast state space inherent in recommendation scenarios, DT can incur significant computational costs and struggle to learn effective state representations. To overcome these issues, we propose a novel Temporal Advantage Decision Transformer with Contrastive State Abstraction (TADT-CSA) model. Specifically, we combine the conventional Return-To-Go (RTG) signal with a novel temporal advantage (TA) signal that encourages the model to capture both long-term returns and their sequential trend. Furthermore, we integrate a contrastive state abstraction module into the DT framework to learn more effective and expressive state representations. Within this module, we introduce a TA-conditioned State Vector Quantization (TAC-SVQ) strategy, where the TA score guides the state codebooks to incorporate contextual token information. Additionally, a reward prediction network and a contrastive transition prediction (CTP) network are employed to ensure the state codebook preserves both the reward information of the current state and the transition information between adjacent states. Empirical results on both public datasets and an online recommendation system demonstrate the effectiveness of the TADT-CSA model and its superiority over baseline methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[Retrieval-Augmented Decision Transformer: External Memory for In-context RL](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07071v3)** | 2025-08-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In-context learning (ICL) is the ability of a model to learn a new task by observing a few exemplars in its context. While prevalent in NLP, this capability has recently also been observed in Reinforcement Learning (RL) settings. Prior in-context RL methods, however, require entire episodes in the agent's context. Given that complex environments typically lead to long episodes with sparse rewards, these methods are constrained to simple environments with short episodes. To address these challenges, we introduce Retrieval-Augmented Decision Transformer (RA-DT). RA-DT employs an external memory mechanism to store past experiences from which it retrieves only sub-trajectories relevant for the current situation. The retrieval component in RA-DT does not require training and can be entirely domain-agnostic. We evaluate the capabilities of RA-DT on grid-world environments, robotics simulations, and procedurally-generated video games. On grid-worlds, RA-DT outperforms baselines, while using only a fraction of their context length. Furthermore, we illuminate the limitations of current in-context RL methods on complex environments and discuss future directions. To facilitate future research, we release datasets for four of the considered environments.</p></details> |  |
| **[ADT4Coupons: An Innovative Framework for Sequential Coupon Distribution in E-commerce](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09198v1)** | 2025-08-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Coupon distribution is a critical marketing strategy used by online platforms to boost revenue and enhance user engagement. Regrettably, existing coupon distribution strategies fall far short of effectively leveraging the complex sequential interactions between platforms and users. This critical oversight, despite the abundance of e-commerce log data, has precipitated a performance plateau. In this paper, we focus on the scene that the platforms make sequential coupon distribution decision multiple times for various users, with each user interacting with the platform repeatedly. Based on this marketing scenario, we propose a novel marketing framework, named Aligned Decision Transformer for Coupons (ADT4Coupons), to directly devise coupon distribution policy for long-term revenue boosting. ADT4Coupons enables optimized online decision-making in a variety of real-world marketing scenarios. It achieves this by seamlessly integrating three key characteristics, general scenarios, sequential modeling with more comprehensive historical data, and efficient iterative updates within a unified framework. Furthermore, empirical results on real-world industrial dataset, alongside public and synthetic datasets demonstrate the superiority of our framework.</p></details> |  |

We present a new reinforcement learning (RL) framework based on the Soft Actor-Critic (SAC) algorithm to optimize engine control in series HEVs. We reformulate the control task as a sequential decision-making problem and enhance SAC by incorporating Gated Recurrent Units (GRUs) and Decision Transformers (DTs) into both actor and critic networks to capture temporal dependencies and improve planning over time. To evaluate robustness and generalization, we train the models under diverse initial battery states, drive cycle durations, power demands, and input sequence lengths. Experiments show that the SAC agent with a DT-based actor and GRU-based critic was within 1.8% of Dynamic Programming (DP) in fuel savings on the Highway Fuel Economy Test (HFET) cycle, while the SAC agent with GRUs in both actor and critic networks, and FFN actor-critic agent were within 3.16% and 3.43%, respectively. On unseen drive cycles (US06 and Heavy Heavy-Duty Diesel Truck (HHDDT) cruise segment), generalized sequence-aware agents consistently outperformed feedforward network (FFN)-based agents, highlighting their adaptability and robustness in real-world settings.</p></details> |  |

The examined evolution strategy proved to be, in general, capable of achieving strong results and managed to produce high-performing agents, showcasing evolution's ability to tackle the training of even such complex models.</p></details> |  |
| **[Decision Transformer-Based Drone Trajectory Planning with Dynamic Safety-Efficiency Trade-Offs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21506v2)** | 2025-07-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A drone trajectory planner should be able to dynamically adjust the safety-efficiency trade-off according to varying mission requirements in unknown environments. Although traditional polynomial-based planners offer computational efficiency and smooth trajectory generation, they require expert knowledge to tune multiple parameters to adjust this trade-off. Moreover, even with careful tuning, the resulting adjustment may fail to achieve the desired trade-off. Similarly, although reinforcement learning-based planners are adaptable in unknown environments, they do not explicitly address the safety-efficiency trade-off. To overcome this limitation, we introduce a Decision Transformer-based trajectory planner that leverages a single parameter, Return-to-Go (RTG), as a \emph{temperature parameter} to dynamically adjust the safety-efficiency trade-off. In our framework, since RTG intuitively measures the safety and efficiency of a trajectory, RTG tuning does not require expert knowledge. We validate our approach using Gazebo simulations in both structured grid and unstructured random environments. The experimental results demonstrate that our planner can dynamically adjust the safety-efficiency trade-off by simply tuning the RTG parameter. Furthermore, our planner outperforms existing baseline methods across various RTG settings, generating safer trajectories when tuned for safety and more efficient trajectories when tuned for efficiency. Real-world experiments further confirm the reliability and practicality of our proposed planner.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS) 2025.

The Prompting Decision Transformer (PDT) enables large-scale, multi-task offline Reinforcement Learning (RL) pre-training by leveraging stochastic trajectory prompts to identify the target task. However, these prompts are sampled uniformly from expert demonstrations, overlooking a critical limitation: not all prompts are equally informative for differentiating between tasks. This limits generalization and adaptation, especially in low-data or open-world settings where sample efficiency is crucial. To address this issue, we propose a lightweight, inference-time, bandit-based prompt-tuning framework. The bandit explores and optimizes trajectory prompt selection to enhance task performance, while avoiding costly fine-tuning of the transformer backbone. Our experiments indicate not only clear performance gains due to bandit-based prompt-tuning, but also better sample complexity, scalability, and prompt space exploration compared to prompt-tuning baselines. These results highlights the importance of adaptive prompt selection mechanisms for efficient generalization in offline multi-task RL.</p></details> |  |
| **[Should We Ever Prefer Decision Transformer for Offline Reinforcement Learning?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10174v1)** | 2025-07-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, extensive work has explored the application of the Transformer architecture to reinforcement learning problems. Among these, Decision Transformer (DT) has gained particular attention in the context of offline reinforcement learning due to its ability to frame return-conditioned policy learning as a sequence modeling task. Most recently, Bhargava et al. (2024) provided a systematic comparison of DT with more conventional MLP-based offline RL algorithms, including Behavior Cloning (BC) and Conservative Q-Learning (CQL), and claimed that DT exhibits superior performance in sparse-reward and low-quality data settings. In this paper, through experimentation on robotic manipulation tasks (Robomimic) and locomotion benchmarks (D4RL), we show that MLP-based Filtered Behavior Cloning (FBC) achieves competitive or superior performance compared to DT in sparse-reward environments. FBC simply filters out low-performing trajectories from the dataset and then performs ordinary behavior cloning on the filtered dataset. FBC is not only very straightforward, but it also requires less training data and is computationally more efficient. The results therefore suggest that DT is not preferable for sparse-reward environments. From prior work, arguably, DT is also not preferable for dense-reward environments. Thus, we pose the question: Is DT ever preferable?</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by RLBrew: Ingredients for Developing Generalist Agents workshop (RLC 2025)</p></details> |
| **[Direct Regret Optimization in Bayesian Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06529v1)** | 2025-07-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Bayesian optimization (BO) is a powerful paradigm for optimizing expensive black-box functions. Traditional BO methods typically rely on separate hand-crafted acquisition functions and surrogate models for the underlying function, and often operate in a myopic manner. In this paper, we propose a novel direct regret optimization approach that jointly learns the optimal model and non-myopic acquisition by distilling from a set of candidate models and acquisitions, and explicitly targets minimizing the multi-step regret. Our framework leverages an ensemble of Gaussian Processes (GPs) with varying hyperparameters to generate simulated BO trajectories, each guided by an acquisition function chosen from a pool of conventional choices, until a Bayesian early stop criterion is met. These simulated trajectories, capturing multi-step exploration strategies, are used to train an end-to-end decision transformer that directly learns to select next query points aimed at improving the ultimate objective. We further adopt a dense training--sparse learning paradigm: The decision transformer is trained offline with abundant simulated data sampled from ensemble GPs and acquisitions, while a limited number of real evaluations refine the GPs online. Experimental results on synthetic and real-world benchmarks suggest that our method consistently outperforms BO baselines, achieving lower simple regret and demonstrating more robust exploration in high-dimensional or noisy settings.</p></details> |  |

The same input features related to failures, ping-pongs, and other handover issues are used. Evaluation for realistic New Radio networks with 3500 MHz carrier frequency on a traffic mix including diverse user service types and a specific tunable cell-pair shows that offline-RL methods outperform rule-based MRO, offering up to 7% improvement.

| **[Optimal Return-to-Go Guided Decision Transformer for Auto-Bidding in Advertisement](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21956v1)** | 2025-06-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the realm of online advertising, advertisers partake in ad auctions to obtain advertising slots, frequently taking advantage of auto-bidding tools provided by demand-side platforms. To improve the automation of these bidding systems, we adopt generative models, namely the Decision Transformer (DT), to tackle the difficulties inherent in automated bidding. Applying the Decision Transformer to the auto-bidding task enables a unified approach to sequential modeling, which efficiently overcomes short-sightedness by capturing long-term dependencies between past bidding actions and user behavior. Nevertheless, conventional DT has certain drawbacks: (1) DT necessitates a preset return-to-go (RTG) value before generating actions, which is not inherently produced; (2) The policy learned by DT is restricted by its training data, which is consists of mixed-quality trajectories. To address these challenges, we introduce the R* Decision Transformer (R* DT), developed in a three-step process: (1) R DT: Similar to traditional DT, R DT stores actions based on state and RTG value, as well as memorizing the RTG for a given state using the training set; (2) R^ DT: We forecast the highest value (within the training set) of RTG for a given state, deriving a suboptimal policy based on the current state and the forecasted supreme RTG value; (3) R* DT: Based on R^ DT, we generate trajectories and select those with high rewards (using a simulator) to augment our training dataset. This data enhancement has been shown to improve the RTG of trajectories in the training data and gradually leads the suboptimal policy towards optimality. Comprehensive tests on a publicly available bidding dataset validate the R* DT's efficacy and highlight its superiority when dealing with mixed-quality trajectories.</p></details> |  |
| **[Return-Aligned Decision Transformer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.03923v6)** | 2025-06-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Traditional approaches in offline reinforcement learning aim to learn the optimal policy that maximizes the cumulative reward, also known as return. It is increasingly important to adjust the performance of AI agents to meet human requirements, for example, in applications like video games and education tools. Decision Transformer (DT) optimizes a policy that generates actions conditioned on the target return through supervised learning and includes a mechanism to control the agent's performance using the target return. However, the action generation is hardly influenced by the target return because DT's self-attention allocates scarce attention scores to the return tokens. In this paper, we propose Return-Aligned Decision Transformer (RADT), designed to more effectively align the actual return with the target return. RADT leverages features extracted by paying attention solely to the return, enabling action generation to consistently depend on the target return. Extensive experiments show that RADT significantly reduces the discrepancies between the actual return and the target return compared to DT-based methods.

These PLMs perform well in RL tasks, raising an intriguing question: what kind of knowledge from PLMs has been transferred to RL to achieve such good results? This work first dives into this problem by analyzing each head quantitatively and points out Markov head, a crucial component that exists in the attention heads of PLMs. It leads to extreme attention on the last-input token and performs well only in short-term environments. Furthermore, we prove that this extreme attention cannot be changed by re-training embedding layer or fine-tuning. Inspired by our analysis, we propose a general method GPT2-DTMA, which equips a pretrained DT with Mixture of Attention (MoA), to accommodate diverse attention requirements during fine-tuning. Extensive experiments corroborate our theorems and demonstrate the effectiveness of GPT2-DTMA: it achieves comparable performance in short-term environments while significantly narrowing the performance gap in long-term environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>The f...</summary><p>The first two authors contributed equally.

In this paper, we first revisit the key impact of task numbers on current MTRL method, and further reveal that naively expanding the parameters proves insufficient to counteract the performance degradation as the number of tasks escalates. Building upon these insights, we propose M3DT, a novel mixture-of-experts (MoE) framework that tackles task scalability by further unlocking the model's parameter scalability. Specifically, we enhance both the architecture and the optimization of the agent, where we strengthen the Decision Transformer (DT) backbone with MoE to reduce task load on parameter subsets, and introduce a three-stage training mechanism to facilitate efficient training with optimal performance. Experimental results show that, by increasing the number of experts, M3DT not only consistently enhances its performance as model expansion on the fixed task numbers, but also exhibits remarkable task scalability, successfully extending to 160 tasks with superior performance.</p></details> | ICML 2025 |
| **[Hierarchical Neuro-Symbolic Decision Transformer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07148v3)** | 2025-05-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present a hierarchical neuro-symbolic control framework that tightly couples a classical symbolic planner with a transformer-based policy to address long-horizon decision-making under uncertainty. At the high level, the planner assembles an interpretable sequence of operators that guarantees logical coherence with task constraints, while at the low level each operator is rendered as a sub-goal token that conditions a decision transformer to generate fine-grained actions directly from raw observations. This bidirectional interface preserves the combinatorial efficiency and explainability of symbolic reasoning without sacrificing the adaptability of deep sequence models, and it permits a principled analysis that tracks how approximation errors from both planning and execution accumulate across the hierarchy. Empirical studies in stochastic grid-world domains demonstrate that the proposed method consistently surpasses purely symbolic, purely neural and existing hierarchical baselines in both success and efficiency, highlighting its robustness for sequential tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Attention-Enhanced Prompt Decision Transformers for UAV-Assisted Communications with AoI](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22170v1)** | 2025-05-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Decision Transformer (DT) has recently demonstrated strong generalizability in dynamic resource allocation within unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) networks, compared to conventional deep reinforcement learning (DRL). However, its performance is hindered due to zero-padding for varying state dimensions, inability to manage long-term energy constraint, and challenges in acquiring expert samples for few-shot fine-tuning in new scenarios. To overcome these limitations, we propose an attention-enhanced prompt Decision Transformer (APDT) framework to optimize trajectory planning and user scheduling, aiming to minimize the average age of information (AoI) under long-term energy constraint in UAV-assisted Internet of Things (IoT) networks. Specifically, we enhance the convenional DT framework by incorporating an attention mechanism to accommodate varying numbers of terrestrial users, introducing a prompt mechanism based on short trajectory demonstrations for rapid adaptation to new scenarios, and designing a token-assisted method to address the UAV's long-term energy constraint. The APDT framework is first pre-trained on offline datasets and then efficiently generalized to new scenarios. Simulations demonstrate that APDT achieves twice faster in terms of convergence rate and reduces average AoI by $8\%$ compared to conventional DT.</p></details> |  |
| **[Prompting Decision Transformers for Zero-Shot Reach-Avoid Policies](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19337v2)** | 2025-05-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Offline goal-conditioned reinforcement learning methods have shown promise for reach-avoid tasks, where an agent must reach a target state while avoiding undesirable regions of the state space. Existing approaches typically encode avoid-region information into an augmented state space and cost function, which prevents flexible, dynamic specification of novel avoid-region information at evaluation time. They also rely heavily on well-designed reward and cost functions, limiting scalability to complex or poorly structured environments. We introduce RADT, a decision transformer model for offline, reward-free, goal-conditioned, avoid region-conditioned RL. RADT encodes goals and avoid regions directly as prompt tokens, allowing any number of avoid regions of arbitrary size to be specified at evaluation time. Using only suboptimal offline trajectories from a random policy, RADT learns reach-avoid behavior through a novel combination of goal and avoid-region hindsight relabeling. We benchmark RADT against 3 existing offline goal-conditioned RL models across 11 tasks, environments, and experimental settings. RADT generalizes in a zero-shot manner to out-of-distribution avoid region sizes and counts, outperforming baselines that require retraining. In one such zero-shot setting, RADT achieves 35.7% improvement in normalized cost over the best retrained baseline while maintaining high goal-reaching success. We apply RADT to cell reprogramming in biology, where it reduces visits to undesirable intermediate gene expression states during trajectories to desired target states, despite stochastic transitions and discrete, structured state dynamics.</p></details> |  |

In the considered system, mobile users are expected to interact with a DT model maintained on a DT server that is deployed on a base station, via effective uplink and downlink channels assisted by an RIS. Our goal is to maximize the sum of all mobile users' joint subjective and objective QoE in DT interactions across various DT scenes, by jointly optimizing phase shift matrix, receive/transmit beamforming matrix, rendering resolution configuration and computing resource allocation. While solving this problem is challenging mainly due to the uncertain evolution of the DT model, which leads to multiple scene-specific problems, and require us to constantly re-solve each of them whenever DT model evolves. To this end, leveraging the dynamic optimization capabilities of decision transformers and the generalization strengths of generative artificial intelligence (GAI), we propose a novel GAI-aided approach, called the prompt-guided decision transformer integrated with zero-forcing optimization (PG-ZFO). Simulations are conducted to evaluate the proposed PG-ZFO, demonstrating its effectiveness and superiority over counterparts.</p></details> |  |

However, DT requires high-quality, comprehensive data to perform optimally. In real-world applications, the lack of training data and the scarcity of optimal behaviours make training on offline datasets challenging, as suboptimal data can hinder performance. To address this, we propose the Counterfactual Reasoning Decision Transformer (CRDT), a novel framework inspired by counterfactual reasoning. CRDT enhances DT ability to reason beyond known data by generating and utilizing counterfactual experiences, enabling improved decision-making in unseen scenarios. Experiments across Atari and D4RL benchmarks, including scenarios with limited data and altered dynamics, demonstrate that CRDT outperforms conventional DT approaches. Additionally, reasoning counterfactually allows the DT agent to obtain stitching abilities, combining suboptimal trajectories, without architectural modifications. These results highlight the potential of counterfactual reasoning to enhance reinforcement learning agents' performance and generalization capabilities.</p></details> |  |

These models generalize effectively, and have proven to be very successful in Natural Language Processing (NLP). Inspired by the generalization capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), we investigate whether the same NTP paradigm can be applied to DBMS design and optimization tasks. Adopting NTP directly for database optimization is non-trivial due to the fundamental differences between the domains. In this paper, we present a framework, termed Probe and Learn (PoLe), for applying NTP to optimize database systems. PoLe leverages Decision Transformers and hardware-generated tokens to effectively incorporate NTP into database systems. As a proof of concept, we demonstrate PoLe in the context of the index scheduling task over NUMA servers in main-memory database systems. Preliminary results for this scheduling task demonstrate that adopting NTP and PoLe can improve both performance and generalizability.</p></details> | <details><summary>To ap...</summary><p>To appear at aiDM@SIGMOD'25</p></details> |

It enables adaptive, on-demand management of the network based on the objectives of the network operators. In this paper, we propose an innovative three-step framework for intent-driven network management based on Generative AI (GenAI) algorithms. First, we fine-tune a Large Language Model (LLM) on a custom dataset using a Quantized Low-Rank Adapter (QLoRA) to enable memory-efficient intent processing within limited computational resources. A Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) module is included to support dynamic decision-making. Second, we utilize a transformer architecture for time series forecasting to predict key parameters, such as power consumption, traffic load, and packet drop rate, to facilitate intent validation proactively. Lastly, we introduce a Hierarchical Decision Transformer with Goal Awareness (HDTGA) to optimize the selection and orchestration of network applications and hence, optimize the network. Our intent guidance and processing approach improves BERTScore by 6% and the semantic similarity score by 9% compared to the base LLM model. Again, the proposed predictive intent validation approach can successfully rule out the performance-degrading intents with an average of 88% accuracy. Finally, compared to the baselines, the proposed HDTGA algorithm increases throughput at least by 19.3%, reduces delay by 48.5%, and boosts energy efficiency by 54.9%.</p></details> | <details><summary>Curre...</summary><p>Currently under review</p></details> |

Our investigation focuses on two primary approaches: Deep Transformer Q- learning Networks (DTQN) for online learning and Decision Transformers (DT) for offline reinforcement learning. DTQN leverages the sequential modelling capabilities of Transformers to enhance Q-learning in partially observable environments,while Decision Transformers repurpose sequence modelling techniques to enable offline agents to learn from past trajectories without direct interaction with the environment. We conclude that while Transformers might have performed well in Atari games, more traditional methods perform better than Transformer based method in both the settings in the VizDoom environment.</p></details> |  |
| **[Improving Sequential Recommenders through Counterfactual Augmentation of System Exposure](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13482v1)** | 2025-04-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In sequential recommendation (SR), system exposure refers to items that are exposed to the user. Typically, only a few of the exposed items would be interacted with by the user. Although SR has achieved great success in predicting future user interests, existing SR methods still fail to fully exploit system exposure data. Most methods only model items that have been interacted with, while the large volume of exposed but non-interacted items is overlooked. Even methods that consider the whole system exposure typically train the recommender using only the logged historical system exposure, without exploring unseen user interests. In this paper, we propose counterfactual augmentation over system exposure for sequential recommendation (CaseRec). To better model historical system exposure, CaseRec introduces reinforcement learning to account for different exposure rewards. CaseRec uses a decision transformer-based sequential model to take an exposure sequence as input and assigns different rewards according to the user feedback. To further explore unseen user interests, CaseRec proposes to perform counterfactual augmentation, where exposed original items are replaced with counterfactual items. Then, a transformer-based user simulator is proposed to predict the user feedback reward for the augmented items. Augmentation, together with the user simulator, constructs counterfactual exposure sequences to uncover new user interests. Finally, CaseRec jointly uses the logged exposure sequences with the counterfactual exposure sequences to train a decision transformer-based sequential model for generating recommendation. Experiments on three real-world benchmarks show the effectiveness of CaseRec. Our code is available at https://github.com/ZiqiZhao1/CaseRec.</p></details> | <details><summary>accep...</summary><p>accepted at SIGIR 2025 (Proceedings of the 48th International ACM SIGIR Conference on Research and Development in Information Retrieval)</p></details> |
| **[Predictive Coding for Decision Transformer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03408v2)** | 2025-04-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent work in offline reinforcement learning (RL) has demonstrated the effectiveness of formulating decision-making as return-conditioned supervised learning. Notably, the decision transformer (DT) architecture has shown promise across various domains. However, despite its initial success, DTs have underperformed on several challenging datasets in goal-conditioned RL. This limitation stems from the inefficiency of return conditioning for guiding policy learning, particularly in unstructured and suboptimal datasets, resulting in DTs failing to effectively learn temporal compositionality. Moreover, this problem might be further exacerbated in long-horizon sparse-reward tasks. To address this challenge, we propose the Predictive Coding for Decision Transformer (PCDT) framework, which leverages generalized future conditioning to enhance DT methods. PCDT utilizes an architecture that extends the DT framework, conditioned on predictive codings, enabling decision-making based on both past and future factors, thereby improving generalization. Through extensive experiments on eight datasets from the AntMaze and FrankaKitchen environments, our proposed method achieves performance on par with or surpassing existing popular value-based and transformer-based methods in offline goal-conditioned RL. Furthermore, we also evaluate our method on a goal-reaching task with a physical robot.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, IROS 2024.

For example, the Decision Transformer recasts agentic decision making as a sequence modeling problem, using a decoder-only LLM to model the distribution over the discrete action space for an Atari agent. However, when adapting LLMs to non-linguistic domains, it remains unclear if softmax over discrete bins captures the continuous structure of the tokens and the potentially complex distributions needed for high quality token generation. We introduce a neural network layer, constructed using Fourier series, which we can easily substitute for any linear layer if we want the outputs to have a more continuous structure. We perform extensive analysis on synthetic datasets, as well as on large-scale decision making and time series forecasting tasks. We also provide theoretical evidence that this layer can better learn signal from data while ignoring high-frequency noise. All of our results support the effectiveness of our proposed Fourier head in scenarios where the underlying data distribution has a natural continuous structure. For example, the Fourier head improves a Decision Transformer agent's returns across four benchmark Atari games by as much as 377%, and increases a state-of-the-art times series foundation model's forecasting performance by 3.5% across 20 benchmarks unseen during training.</p></details> | <details><summary>Camer...</summary><p>Camera ready version (ICLR 2025).

| **[Target Return Optimizer for Multi-Game Decision Transformer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02311v1)** | 2025-03-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Achieving autonomous agents with robust generalization capabilities across diverse games and tasks remains one of the ultimate goals in AI research. Recent advancements in transformer-based offline reinforcement learning, exemplified by the MultiGame Decision Transformer [Lee et al., 2022], have shown remarkable performance across various games or tasks. However, these approaches depend heavily on human expertise, presenting substantial challenges for practical deployment, particularly in scenarios with limited prior game-specific knowledge. In this paper, we propose an algorithm called Multi-Game Target Return Optimizer (MTRO) to autonomously determine game-specific target returns within the Multi-Game Decision Transformer framework using solely offline datasets. MTRO addresses the existing limitations by automating the target return configuration process, leveraging environmental reward information extracted from offline datasets. Notably, MTRO does not require additional training, enabling seamless integration into existing Multi-Game Decision Transformer architectures. Our experimental evaluations on Atari games demonstrate that MTRO enhances the performance of RL policies across a wide array of games, underscoring its potential to advance the field of autonomous agent development.</p></details> | 10 pages |
| **[Tackling Data Corruption in Offline Reinforcement Learning via Sequence Modeling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04285v4)** | 2025-03-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Learning policy from offline datasets through offline reinforcement learning (RL) holds promise for scaling data-driven decision-making while avoiding unsafe and costly online interactions. However, real-world data collected from sensors or humans often contains noise and errors, posing a significant challenge for existing offline RL methods, particularly when the real-world data is limited. Our study reveals that prior research focusing on adapting predominant offline RL methods based on temporal difference learning still falls short under data corruption when the dataset is limited. In contrast, we discover that vanilla sequence modeling methods, such as Decision Transformer, exhibit robustness against data corruption, even without specialized modifications. To unlock the full potential of sequence modeling, we propose Robust Decision Rransformer (RDT) by incorporating three simple yet effective robust techniques: embedding dropout to improve the model's robustness against erroneous inputs, Gaussian weighted learning to mitigate the effects of corrupted labels, and iterative data correction to eliminate corrupted data from the source. Extensive experiments on MuJoCo, Kitchen, and Adroit tasks demonstrate RDT's superior performance under various data corruption scenarios compared to prior methods. Furthermore, RDT exhibits remarkable robustness in a more challenging setting that combines training-time data corruption with test-time observation perturbations. These results highlight the potential of sequence modeling for learning from noisy or corrupted offline datasets, thereby promoting the reliable application of offline RL in real-world scenarios.

Transformers, a standard choice for modeling time-series data, are gaining popularity in offline RL. In this context, Beam Search (BS), an approximate inference algorithm, is the go-to decoding method. Offline RL eliminates the need for costly or risky online data collection. However, the restricted dataset induces uncertainty as the agent may encounter unfamiliar sequences of states and actions during execution that were not covered in the training data. In this context, BS lacks two important properties essential for offline RL: It does not account for the aforementioned uncertainty, and its greedy left-right search approach often results in sequences with minimal variations, failing to explore potentially better alternatives. To address these limitations, we propose Portfolio Beam Search (PBS), a simple-yet-effective alternative to BS that balances exploration and exploitation within a Transformer model during decoding. We draw inspiration from financial economics and apply these principles to develop an uncertainty-aware diversification mechanism, which we integrate into a sequential decoding algorithm at inference time. We empirically demonstrate the effectiveness of PBS on the D4RL locomotion benchmark, where it achieves higher returns and significantly reduces outcome variability.</p></details> |  |
| **[Decision Transformer for Enhancing Neural Local Search on the Job Shop Scheduling Problem](https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02697v2)** | 2025-02-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The job shop scheduling problem (JSSP) and its solution algorithms have been of enduring interest in both academia and industry for decades. In recent years, machine learning (ML) is playing an increasingly important role in advancing existing and building new heuristic solutions for the JSSP, aiming to find better solutions in shorter computation times. In this paper we build on top of a state-of-the-art deep reinforcement learning (DRL) agent, called Neural Local Search (NLS), which can efficiently and effectively control a large local neighborhood search on the JSSP. In particular, we develop a method for training the decision transformer (DT) algorithm on search trajectories taken by a trained NLS agent to further improve upon the learned decision-making sequences. Our experiments show that the DT successfully learns local search strategies that are different and, in many cases, more effective than those of the NLS agent itself. In terms of the tradeoff between solution quality and acceptable computational time needed for the search, the DT is particularly superior in application scenarios where longer computational times are acceptable. In this case, it makes up for the longer inference times required per search step, which are caused by the larger neural network architecture, through better quality decisions per step. Thereby, the DT achieves state-of-the-art results for solving the JSSP with ML-enhanced search.</p></details> |  |

Current state-of-the-art approaches are based on supervised learning with a conditioned policy. However, these approaches fall short in real-world applications that involve complex tasks with rich temporal and logical structures. In this paper, we propose temporal logic Specification-conditioned Decision Transformer (SDT), a novel framework that harnesses the expressive power of signal temporal logic (STL) to specify complex temporal rules that an agent should follow and the sequential modeling capability of Decision Transformer (DT). Empirical evaluations on the DSRL benchmarks demonstrate the better capacity of SDT in learning safe and high-reward policies compared with existing approaches.

Current recommendation strategies grapple with two significant hurdles. Firstly, the future impacts of recommendation decisions remain obscured, rendering it impractical to evaluate them through direct optimization of immediate metrics. Secondly, conflicts often emerge between multiple objectives, like enhancing accuracy versus exploring diverse recommendations. Existing strategies, trapped in a "training, evaluation, and retraining" loop, grow more labor-intensive as objectives evolve. To address these challenges, we introduce a future-conditioned strategy for multi-objective controllable recommendations, allowing for the direct specification of future objectives and empowering the model to generate item sequences that align with these goals autoregressively. We present the Multi-Objective Controllable Decision Transformer (MocDT), an offline Reinforcement Learning (RL) model capable of autonomously learning the mapping from multiple objectives to item sequences, leveraging extensive offline data. Consequently, it can produce recommendations tailored to any specified objectives during the inference stage. Our empirical findings emphasize the controllable recommendation strategy's ability to produce item sequences according to different objectives while maintaining performance that is competitive with current recommendation strategies across various objectives.</p></details> |  |
| **[Integrating Multi-Modal Input Token Mixer Into Mamba-Based Decision Models: Decision MetaMamba](https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10517v5)** | 2025-01-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Sequence modeling with State Space models (SSMs) has demonstrated performance surpassing that of Transformers in various tasks, raising expectations for their potential to outperform the Decision Transformer and its enhanced variants in offline reinforcement learning (RL). However, decision models based on Mamba, a state-of-the-art SSM, failed to achieve superior performance compared to these enhanced Decision Transformers. We hypothesize that this limitation arises from information loss during the selective scanning phase. To address this, we propose the Decision MetaMamba (DMM), which augments Mamba with a token mixer in its input layer. This mixer explicitly accounts for the multimodal nature of offline RL inputs, comprising state, action, and return-to-go. The DMM demonstrates improved performance while significantly reducing parameter count compared to prior models. Notably, similar performance gains were achieved using a simple linear token mixer, emphasizing the importance of preserving information from proximate time steps rather than the specific design of the token mixer itself. This novel modification to Mamba's input layer represents a departure from conventional timestamp-based encoding approaches used in Transformers. By enhancing performance of Mamba in offline RL, characterized by memory efficiency and fast inference, this work opens new avenues for its broader application in future RL research.</p></details> | <details><summary>We ha...</summary><p>We have decided to withdraw this manuscript as we believe that the work requires significant improvements and further research to ensure its quality and impact.

| **[In-Dataset Trajectory Return Regularization for Offline Preference-based Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09104v2)** | 2024-12-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Offline preference-based reinforcement learning (PbRL) typically operates in two phases: first, use human preferences to learn a reward model and annotate rewards for a reward-free offline dataset; second, learn a policy by optimizing the learned reward via offline RL. However, accurately modeling step-wise rewards from trajectory-level preference feedback presents inherent challenges. The reward bias introduced, particularly the overestimation of predicted rewards, leads to optimistic trajectory stitching, which undermines the pessimism mechanism critical to the offline RL phase. To address this challenge, we propose In-Dataset Trajectory Return Regularization (DTR) for offline PbRL, which leverages conditional sequence modeling to mitigate the risk of learning inaccurate trajectory stitching under reward bias. Specifically, DTR employs Decision Transformer and TD-Learning to strike a balance between maintaining fidelity to the behavior policy with high in-dataset trajectory returns and selecting optimal actions based on high reward labels. Additionally, we introduce an ensemble normalization technique that effectively integrates multiple reward models, balancing the tradeoff between reward differentiation and accuracy. Empirical evaluations on various benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of DTR over other state-of-the-art baselines.</p></details> | <details><summary>20 pa...</summary><p>20 pages, Proceedings of the 39th AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence (AAAI-25)</p></details> |

Current approaches typically require long trajectory sequences to model the environment in offline RL settings. However, these models tend to over-rely on memorizing long-term representations, which impairs their ability to effectively attribute importance to trajectories and learned representations based on task-specific relevance. In this work, we introduce AdaCred, a novel approach that represents trajectories as causal graphs built from short-term action-reward-state sequences. Our model adaptively learns control policy by crediting and pruning low-importance representations, retaining only those most relevant for the downstream task. Our experiments demonstrate that AdaCred-based policies require shorter trajectory sequences and consistently outperform conventional methods in both offline reinforcement learning and imitation learning environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to 24th International Conference on Autonomous Agents and Multiagent Systems (AAMAS 2025)</p></details> |

In real-world scenarios, data collection could be costly and risky; therefore, offline RL becomes particularly challenging when the in-domain data is limited. Given recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) and their few-shot learning prowess, this paper introduces $\textbf{La}$nguage Models for $\textbf{Mo}$tion Control ($\textbf{LaMo}$), a general framework based on Decision Transformers to effectively use pre-trained Language Models (LMs) for offline RL. Our framework highlights four crucial components: (1) Initializing Decision Transformers with sequentially pre-trained LMs, (2) employing the LoRA fine-tuning method, in contrast to full-weight fine-tuning, to combine the pre-trained knowledge from LMs and in-domain knowledge effectively, (3) using the non-linear MLP transformation instead of linear projections, to generate embeddings, and (4) integrating an auxiliary language prediction loss during fine-tuning to stabilize the LMs and retain their original abilities on languages. Empirical results indicate $\textbf{LaMo}$ achieves excellent performance in sparse-reward tasks and closes the gap between value-based offline RL methods and decision transformers in dense-reward tasks. In particular, our method demonstrates superior performance in scenarios with limited data samples.</p></details> | Format adjustment |

These attacks aim to manipulate the victim into specific behaviors that align with the attacker's objectives, often bypassing traditional reward-based defenses. Prior methods have primarily focused on reducing cumulative rewards; however, rewards are typically too generic to capture complex safety requirements effectively. As a result, focusing solely on reward reduction can lead to suboptimal attack strategies, particularly in safety-critical scenarios where more precise behavior manipulation is needed. To address these challenges, we propose RAT, a method designed for universal, targeted behavior attacks. RAT trains an intention policy that is explicitly aligned with human preferences, serving as a precise behavioral target for the adversary. Concurrently, an adversary manipulates the victim's policy to follow this target behavior. To enhance the effectiveness of these attacks, RAT dynamically adjusts the state occupancy measure within the replay buffer, allowing for more controlled and effective behavior manipulation. Our empirical results on robotic simulation tasks demonstrate that RAT outperforms existing adversarial attack algorithms in inducing specific behaviors. Additionally, RAT shows promise in improving agent robustness, leading to more resilient policies. We further validate RAT by guiding Decision Transformer agents to adopt behaviors aligned with human preferences in various MuJoCo tasks, demonstrating its effectiveness across diverse tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by AAAI 2025</p></details> |

A recent key development in this area is the integration of prompting in decision transformers to facilitate few-shot policy generalization. However, current methods mainly use static prompt segments to guide rollouts, limiting their ability to provide context-specific guidance. Addressing this, we introduce a hierarchical prompting approach enabled by retrieval augmentation. Our method learns two layers of soft tokens as guiding prompts: (1) global tokens encapsulating task-level information about trajectories, and (2) adaptive tokens that deliver focused, timestep-specific instructions. The adaptive tokens are dynamically retrieved from a curated set of demonstration segments, ensuring context-aware guidance. Experiments across seven benchmark tasks in the MuJoCo and MetaWorld environments demonstrate the proposed approach consistently outperforms all baseline methods, suggesting that hierarchical prompting for decision transformers is an effective strategy to enable few-shot policy generalization.</p></details> |  |

The study first observed that DM generally outperformed DT in the games Breakout and Qbert, while DT performed better in more complicated games, such as Hero and Kung Fu Master. To understand these differences, we expanded the number of games to 12 and performed a comprehensive analysis of game characteristics, including action space complexity, visual complexity, average trajectory length, and average steps to the first non-zero reward. In order to further analyse the key factors that impact the disparity in performance between DT and DM, we employ various approaches, including quantifying visual complexity, random forest regression, correlation analysis, and action space simplification strategies. The results indicate that the performance gap between DT and DM is affected by the complex interaction of multiple factors, with the complexity of the action space and visual complexity (particularly evaluated by compression ratio) being the primary determining factors. DM performs well in environments with simple action and visual elements, while DT shows an advantage in games with higher action and visual complexity. Our findings contribute to a deeper understanding of how the game characteristics affect the performance difference in sequential modelling reinforcement learning, potentially guiding the development of future model design and applications for diverse and complex environments.</p></details> |  |
| **[Offline Reinforcement Learning and Sequence Modeling for Downlink Link Adaptation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23031v2)** | 2024-11-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Link adaptation (LA) is an essential function in modern wireless communication systems that dynamically adjusts the transmission rate of a communication link to match time- and frequency-varying radio link conditions. However, factors such as user mobility, fast fading, imperfect channel quality information, and aging of measurements make the modeling of LA challenging. To bypass the need for explicit modeling, recent research has introduced online reinforcement learning (RL) approaches as an alternative to the more commonly used rule-based algorithms. Yet, RL-based approaches face deployment challenges, as training in live networks can potentially degrade real-time performance. To address this challenge, this paper considers offline RL as a candidate to learn LA policies with minimal effects on the network operation. We propose three LA designs based on batch-constrained deep Q-learning, conservative Q-learning, and decision transformer. Our results show that offline RL algorithms can match the performance of state-of-the-art online RL methods when data is collected with a proper behavioral policy.</p></details> |  |

Previous efforts utilizing extensive offline datasets from various tasks demonstrate remarkable performance in multitasking scenarios within Reinforcement Learning. However, these works encounter challenges in extending their capabilities to new tasks. Recent approaches integrate textual guidance or visual trajectory into decision networks to provide task-specific contextual cues, representing a promising direction. However, it is observed that relying solely on textual guidance or visual trajectory is insufficient for accurately conveying the contextual information of tasks. This paper explores enhanced forms of task guidance for agents, enabling them to comprehend gameplay instructions, thereby facilitating a "read-to-play" capability. Drawing inspiration from the success of multimodal instruction tuning in visual tasks, we treat the visual-based RL task as a long-horizon vision task and construct a set of multimodal game instructions to incorporate instruction tuning into a decision transformer. Experimental results demonstrate that incorporating multimodal game instructions significantly enhances the decision transformer's multitasking and generalization capabilities.</p></details> |  |
| **[Enhancing Decision Transformer with Diffusion-Based Trajectory Branch Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11327v1)** | 2024-11-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Decision Transformer (DT) can learn effective policy from offline datasets by converting the offline reinforcement learning (RL) into a supervised sequence modeling task, where the trajectory elements are generated auto-regressively conditioned on the return-to-go (RTG).However, the sequence modeling learning approach tends to learn policies that converge on the sub-optimal trajectories within the dataset, for lack of bridging data to move to better trajectories, even if the condition is set to the highest RTG.To address this issue, we introduce Diffusion-Based Trajectory Branch Generation (BG), which expands the trajectories of the dataset with branches generated by a diffusion model.The trajectory branch is generated based on the segment of the trajectory within the dataset, and leads to trajectories with higher returns.We concatenate the generated branch with the trajectory segment as an expansion of the trajectory.After expanding, DT has more opportunities to learn policies to move to better trajectories, preventing it from converging to the sub-optimal trajectories.Empirically, after processing with BG, DT outperforms state-of-the-art sequence modeling methods on D4RL benchmark, demonstrating the effectiveness of adding branches to the dataset without further modifications.</p></details> |  |

Since then, the heterogeneity in the design space of hardware has only increased to the point that DBMS performance may vary significantly up to an order of magnitude in modern servers. An important factor that affects performance includes the location of the logical cores where the DBMS queries are scheduled, and the locations of the data that the queries access. This paper introduces P-MOSS, a learned spatial scheduling framework that schedules query execution to certain logical cores, and places data accordingly to certain integrated memory controllers (IMC), to integrate hardware consciousness into the system. In the spirit of hardware-software synergy, P-MOSS solely guides its scheduling decision based on low-level hardware statistics collected by performance monitoring counters with the aid of a Decision Transformer. Experimental evaluation is performed in the context of the B-tree and R-tree indexes. Performance results demonstrate that P-MOSS has up to 6x improvement over traditional schedules in terms of query throughput.</p></details> |  |
| **[Multi-Agent Decision Transformers for Dynamic Dispatching in Material Handling Systems Leveraging Enterprise Big Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02584v1)** | 2024-11-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Dynamic dispatching rules that allocate resources to tasks in real-time play a critical role in ensuring efficient operations of many automated material handling systems across industries. Traditionally, the dispatching rules deployed are typically the result of manually crafted heuristics based on domain experts' knowledge. Generating these rules is time-consuming and often sub-optimal. As enterprises increasingly accumulate vast amounts of operational data, there is significant potential to leverage this big data to enhance the performance of automated systems. One promising approach is to use Decision Transformers, which can be trained on existing enterprise data to learn better dynamic dispatching rules for improving system throughput. In this work, we study the application of Decision Transformers as dynamic dispatching policies within an actual multi-agent material handling system and identify scenarios where enterprises can effectively leverage Decision Transformers on existing big data to gain business value. Our empirical results demonstrate that Decision Transformers can improve the material handling system's throughput by a considerable amount when the heuristic originally used in the enterprise data exhibits moderate performance and involves no randomness. When the original heuristic has strong performance, Decision Transformers can still improve the throughput but with a smaller improvement margin. However, when the original heuristics contain an element of randomness or when the performance of the dataset is below a certain threshold, Decision Transformers fail to outperform the original heuristic. These results highlight both the potential and limitations of Decision Transformers as dispatching policies for automated industrial material handling systems.</p></details> |  |

Recent advancements approach this through sequence modeling, leveraging the Transformer architecture's scalability and the benefits of parameter sharing to exploit task similarities. However, variations in task content and complexity pose significant challenges in policy formulation, necessitating judicious parameter sharing and management of conflicting gradients for optimal policy performance. Furthermore, identifying the optimal parameter subspace for each task often necessitates prior knowledge of the task identifier during inference, limiting applicability in real-world scenarios with variable task content and unknown current tasks. In this work, we introduce the Harmony Multi-Task Decision Transformer (HarmoDT), a novel solution designed to identify an optimal harmony subspace of parameters for each task. We formulate this as a bi-level optimization problem within a meta-learning framework, where the upper level learns masks to define the harmony subspace, while the inner level focuses on updating parameters to improve the overall performance of the unified policy. To eliminate the need for task identifiers, we further design a group-wise variant (G-HarmoDT) that clusters tasks into coherent groups based on gradient information, and utilizes a gating network to determine task identifiers during inference. Empirical evaluations across various benchmarks highlight the superiority of our approach, demonstrating its effectiveness in the multi-task context with specific improvements of 8% gain in task-provided settings, 5% in task-agnostic settings, and 10% in unseen settings.</p></details> | <details><summary>Exten...</summary><p>Extension of corresponding ICML edition arXiv:2405.18080. arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:2405.18080</p></details> |

However, current VLN frameworks often rely on static environments and optimal expert supervision, limiting their real-world applicability. To address this, we introduce Human-Aware Vision-and-Language Navigation (HA-VLN), extending traditional VLN by incorporating dynamic human activities and relaxing key assumptions. We propose the Human-Aware 3D (HA3D) simulator, which combines dynamic human activities with the Matterport3D dataset, and the Human-Aware Room-to-Room (HA-R2R) dataset, extending R2R with human activity descriptions. To tackle HA-VLN challenges, we present the Expert-Supervised Cross-Modal (VLN-CM) and Non-Expert-Supervised Decision Transformer (VLN-DT) agents, utilizing cross-modal fusion and diverse training strategies for effective navigation in dynamic human environments. A comprehensive evaluation, including metrics considering human activities, and systematic analysis of HA-VLN's unique challenges, underscores the need for further research to enhance HA-VLN agents' real-world robustness and adaptability. Ultimately, this work provides benchmarks and insights for future research on embodied AI and Sim2Real transfer, paving the way for more realistic and applicable VLN systems in human-populated environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>Spotl...</summary><p>Spotlight at NeurIPS 2024 D&B Track. 32 pages, 18 figures, Project Page: https://lpercc.github.io/HA3D_simulator/</p></details> |
| **[Adversarially Robust Decision Transformer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18414v2)** | 2024-11-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Decision Transformer (DT), as one of the representative Reinforcement Learning via Supervised Learning (RvS) methods, has achieved strong performance in offline learning tasks by leveraging the powerful Transformer architecture for sequential decision-making. However, in adversarial environments, these methods can be non-robust, since the return is dependent on the strategies of both the decision-maker and adversary. Training a probabilistic model conditioned on observed return to predict action can fail to generalize, as the trajectories that achieve a return in the dataset might have done so due to a suboptimal behavior adversary. To address this, we propose a worst-case-aware RvS algorithm, the Adversarially Robust Decision Transformer (ARDT), which learns and conditions the policy on in-sample minimax returns-to-go. ARDT aligns the target return with the worst-case return learned through minimax expectile regression, thereby enhancing robustness against powerful test-time adversaries. In experiments conducted on sequential games with full data coverage, ARDT can generate a maximin (Nash Equilibrium) strategy, the solution with the largest adversarial robustness. In large-scale sequential games and continuous adversarial RL environments with partial data coverage, ARDT demonstrates significantly superior robustness to powerful test-time adversaries and attains higher worst-case returns compared to contemporary DT methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to NeurIPS 2024</p></details> |
| **[Reinforcement Learning Gradients as Vitamin for Online Finetuning Decision Transformers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.24108v1)** | 2024-10-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Decision Transformers have recently emerged as a new and compelling paradigm for offline Reinforcement Learning (RL), completing a trajectory in an autoregressive way. While improvements have been made to overcome initial shortcomings, online finetuning of decision transformers has been surprisingly under-explored. The widely adopted state-of-the-art Online Decision Transformer (ODT) still struggles when pretrained with low-reward offline data. In this paper, we theoretically analyze the online-finetuning of the decision transformer, showing that the commonly used Return-To-Go (RTG) that's far from the expected return hampers the online fine-tuning process. This problem, however, is well-addressed by the value function and advantage of standard RL algorithms. As suggested by our analysis, in our experiments, we hence find that simply adding TD3 gradients to the finetuning process of ODT effectively improves the online finetuning performance of ODT, especially if ODT is pretrained with low-reward offline data. These findings provide new directions to further improve decision transformers.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted as NeurIPS 2024 spotlight. 33 pages, 26 figures</p></details> |
| **[Return Augmented Decision Transformer for Off-Dynamics Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23450v1)** | 2024-10-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We study offline off-dynamics reinforcement learning (RL) to utilize data from an easily accessible source domain to enhance policy learning in a target domain with limited data. Our approach centers on return-conditioned supervised learning (RCSL), particularly focusing on the decision transformer (DT), which can predict actions conditioned on desired return guidance and complete trajectory history. Previous works tackle the dynamics shift problem by augmenting the reward in the trajectory from the source domain to match the optimal trajectory in the target domain. However, this strategy can not be directly applicable in RCSL owing to (1) the unique form of the RCSL policy class, which explicitly depends on the return, and (2) the absence of a straightforward representation of the optimal trajectory distribution. We propose the Return Augmented Decision Transformer (RADT) method, where we augment the return in the source domain by aligning its distribution with that in the target domain. We provide the theoretical analysis demonstrating that the RCSL policy learned from RADT achieves the same level of suboptimality as would be obtained without a dynamics shift. We introduce two practical implementations RADT-DARA and RADT-MV respectively. Extensive experiments conducted on D4RL datasets reveal that our methods generally outperform dynamic programming based methods in off-dynamics RL scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>26 pa...</summary><p>26 pages, 10 tables, 10 figures</p></details> |

Yet, it poses challenges due to substantial parameter size and limited scalability, which is particularly critical in sequential decision-making scenarios where resources are constrained such as in robots and drones with limited computational power. Mamba, a promising new linear-time sequence model, offers performance on par with transformers while delivering substantially fewer parameters on long sequences. As it remains unclear whether Mamba is compatible with trajectory optimization, this work aims to conduct comprehensive experiments to explore the potential of Decision Mamba (dubbed DeMa) in offline RL from the aspect of data structures and essential components with the following insights: (1) Long sequences impose a significant computational burden without contributing to performance improvements since DeMa's focus on sequences diminishes approximately exponentially. Consequently, we introduce a Transformer-like DeMa as opposed to an RNN-like DeMa. (2) For the components of DeMa, we identify the hidden attention mechanism as a critical factor in its success, which can also work well with other residual structures and does not require position embedding. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that our specially designed DeMa is compatible with trajectory optimization and surpasses previous methods, outperforming Decision Transformer (DT) with higher performance while using 30\% fewer parameters in Atari, and exceeding DT with only a quarter of the parameters in MuJoCo.</p></details> | 23 pages, 11 figures |

The language and vision communities have seen remarkable progress toward this trend by scaling up transformer-based models trained on massive datasets, while reinforcement learning (RL) agents still suffer from poor generalization capacity under such paradigms. To tackle this challenge, we propose Meta Decision Transformer (Meta-DT), which leverages the sequential modeling ability of the transformer architecture and robust task representation learning via world model disentanglement to achieve efficient generalization in offline meta-RL. We pretrain a context-aware world model to learn a compact task representation, and inject it as a contextual condition to the causal transformer to guide task-oriented sequence generation. Then, we subtly utilize history trajectories generated by the meta-policy as a self-guided prompt to exploit the architectural inductive bias. We select the trajectory segment that yields the largest prediction error on the pretrained world model to construct the prompt, aiming to encode task-specific information complementary to the world model maximally. Notably, the proposed framework eliminates the requirement of any expert demonstration or domain knowledge at test time. Experimental results on MuJoCo and Meta-World benchmarks across various dataset types show that Meta-DT exhibits superior few and zero-shot generalization capacity compared to strong baselines while being more practical with fewer prerequisites.

In this work, we introduce two novel methods, Decision Mamba (DM) and Hierarchical Decision Mamba (HDM), aimed at enhancing the performance of the Transformer models. Through extensive experimentation across diverse environments such as OpenAI Gym and D4RL, leveraging varying demonstration data sets, we demonstrate the superiority of Mamba models over their Transformer counterparts in a majority of tasks.

However, efficiently integrating world models with decision transformers remains a challenge. In this paper, we introduce a novel approach that combines the Dreamer algorithm's ability to generate anticipatory trajectories with the adaptive learning strengths of the Online Decision Transformer. Our methodology enables parallel training where Dreamer-produced trajectories enhance the contextual decision-making of the transformer, creating a bidirectional enhancement loop. We empirically demonstrate the efficacy of our approach on a suite of challenging benchmarks, achieving notable improvements in sample efficiency and reward maximization over existing methods. Our results indicate that the proposed integrated framework not only accelerates learning but also showcases robustness in diverse and dynamic scenarios, marking a significant step forward in model-based reinforcement learning.</p></details> |  |
| **[Decision Transformers for Wireless Communications: A New Paradigm of Resource Management](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05199v2)** | 2024-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As the next generation of mobile systems evolves, artificial intelligence (AI) is expected to deeply integrate with wireless communications for resource management in variable environments. In particular, deep reinforcement learning (DRL) is an important tool for addressing stochastic optimization issues of resource allocation. However, DRL has to start each new training process from the beginning once the state and action spaces change, causing low sample efficiency and poor generalization ability. Moreover, each DRL training process may take a large number of epochs to converge, which is unacceptable for time-sensitive scenarios. In this paper, we adopt an alternative AI technology, namely, Decision Transformer (DT), and propose a DT-based adaptive decision architecture for wireless resource management. This architecture innovates through constructing pre-trained models in the cloud and then fine-tuning personalized models at the edges. By leveraging the power of DT models learned over offline datasets, the proposed architecture is expected to achieve rapid convergence with many fewer training epochs and higher performance in new scenarios with different state and action spaces, compared with DRL. We then design DT frameworks for two typical communication scenarios: intelligent reflecting surfaces-aided communications and unmanned aerial vehicle-aided mobile edge computing. Simulations demonstrate that the proposed DT frameworks achieve over $3$-$6$ times speedup in convergence and better performance relative to the classic DRL method, namely, proximal policy optimization.</p></details> |  |
| **[Solving Multi-Goal Robotic Tasks with Decision Transformer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06347v1)** | 2024-10-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Artificial intelligence plays a crucial role in robotics, with reinforcement learning (RL) emerging as one of the most promising approaches for robot control. However, several key challenges hinder its broader application. First, many RL methods rely on online learning, which requires either real-world hardware or advanced simulation environments--both of which can be costly, time-consuming, and impractical. Offline reinforcement learning offers a solution, enabling models to be trained without ongoing access to physical robots or simulations. A second challenge is learning multi-goal tasks, where robots must achieve multiple objectives simultaneously. This adds complexity to the training process, as the model must generalize across different goals. At the same time, transformer architectures have gained significant popularity across various domains, including reinforcement learning. Yet, no existing methods effectively combine offline training, multi-goal learning, and transformer-based architectures. In this paper, we address these challenges by introducing a novel adaptation of the decision transformer architecture for offline multi-goal reinforcement learning in robotics. Our approach integrates goal-specific information into the decision transformer, allowing it to handle complex tasks in an offline setting. To validate our method, we developed a new offline reinforcement learning dataset using the Panda robotic platform in simulation. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that the decision transformer can outperform state-of-the-art online reinforcement learning methods.</p></details> |  |

Recent successes of Transformers inspire casting offline RL as sequence modeling, which, however, fails in stochastic environments with incorrect assumptions that identical actions can consistently achieve the same goal. In this paper, we introduce an UNcertainty-awaRE deciSion Transformer (UNREST) for planning in stochastic driving environments without introducing additional transition or complex generative models. Specifically, UNREST estimates uncertainties by conditional mutual information between transitions and returns. Discovering 'uncertainty accumulation' and 'temporal locality' properties of driving environments, we replace the global returns in decision transformers with truncated returns less affected by environments to learn from actual outcomes of actions rather than environment transitions. We also dynamically evaluate uncertainty at inference for cautious planning. Extensive experiments demonstrate UNREST's superior performance in various driving scenarios and the power of our uncertainty estimation strategy.</p></details> |  |

However, they often struggle with long-horizon tasks due to the high compounding error of auto-regressive models. To overcome this limitation, we go beyond next-token prediction and introduce Planning Tokens, which contain high-level, long time-scale information about the agent's future. Predicting dual time-scale tokens at regular intervals enables our model to use these long-horizon Planning Tokens as a form of implicit planning to guide its low-level policy and reduce compounding error. This architectural modification significantly enhances performance on long-horizon tasks, establishing a new state-of-the-art in complex D4RL environments. Additionally, we demonstrate that Planning Tokens improve the interpretability of the model's policy through the interpretable plan visualisations and attention map.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 5 figures, Submitted to AAAI</p></details> |
| **[Q-value Regularized Decision ConvFormer for Offline Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08062v1)** | 2024-09-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As a data-driven paradigm, offline reinforcement learning (Offline RL) has been formulated as sequence modeling, where the Decision Transformer (DT) has demonstrated exceptional capabilities. Unlike previous reinforcement learning methods that fit value functions or compute policy gradients, DT adjusts the autoregressive model based on the expected returns, past states, and actions, using a causally masked Transformer to output the optimal action. However, due to the inconsistency between the sampled returns within a single trajectory and the optimal returns across multiple trajectories, it is challenging to set an expected return to output the optimal action and stitch together suboptimal trajectories. Decision ConvFormer (DC) is easier to understand in the context of modeling RL trajectories within a Markov Decision Process compared to DT. We propose the Q-value Regularized Decision ConvFormer (QDC), which combines the understanding of RL trajectories by DC and incorporates a term that maximizes action values using dynamic programming methods during training. This ensures that the expected returns of the sampled actions are consistent with the optimal returns. QDC achieves excellent performance on the D4RL benchmark, outperforming or approaching the optimal level in all tested environments. It particularly demonstrates outstanding competitiveness in trajectory stitching capability.</p></details> |  |

However, RL trajectories possess unique properties to be distinguished from the conventional sequence (e.g., text or audio): (1) local correlation, where the next states in RL are theoretically determined solely by current states and actions based on the Markov Decision Process (MDP), and (2) global correlation, where each step's features are related to long-term historical information due to the time-continuous nature of trajectories. In this paper, we propose a novel action sequence predictor, named Mamba Decision Maker (MambaDM), where Mamba is expected to be a promising alternative for sequence modeling paradigms, owing to its efficient modeling of multi-scale dependencies. In particular, we introduce a novel mixer module that proficiently extracts and integrates both global and local features of the input sequence, effectively capturing interrelationships in RL datasets. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MambaDM achieves state-of-the-art performance in Atari and OpenAI Gym datasets. Furthermore, we empirically investigate the scaling laws of MambaDM, finding that increasing model size does not bring performance improvement, but scaling the dataset amount by 2x for MambaDM can obtain up to 33.7% score improvement on Atari dataset. This paper delves into the sequence modeling capabilities of MambaDM in the RL domain, paving the way for future advancements in robust and efficient decision-making systems.</p></details> | 8 pages, 4 figures |

Its application, however, has been limited by the lack of interpretability and interactivity for clinicians. To address these challenges, we propose the medical decision transformer (MeDT), a novel and versatile framework based on the goal-conditioned reinforcement learning paradigm for sepsis treatment recommendation. MeDT uses the decision transformer architecture to learn a policy for drug dosage recommendation. During offline training, MeDT utilizes collected treatment trajectories to predict administered treatments for each time step, incorporating known treatment outcomes, target acuity scores, past treatment decisions, and current and past medical states. This analysis enables MeDT to capture complex dependencies among a patient's medical history, treatment decisions, outcomes, and short-term effects on stability. Our proposed conditioning uses acuity scores to address sparse reward issues and to facilitate clinician-model interactions, enhancing decision-making. Following training, MeDT can generate tailored treatment recommendations by conditioning on the desired positive outcome (survival) and user-specified short-term stability improvements. We carry out rigorous experiments on data from the MIMIC-III dataset and use off-policy evaluation to demonstrate that MeDT recommends interventions that outperform or are competitive with existing offline reinforcement learning methods while enabling a more interpretable, personalized and clinician-directed approach.</p></details> |  |

The prevailing approach, tracking-by-detection (TbD), first detects objects and then links detections, resulting in a simple yet effective method. However, contemporary detectors may occasionally miss some objects in certain frames, causing trackers to cease tracking prematurely. To tackle this issue, we propose BUSCA, meaning `to search', a versatile framework compatible with any online TbD system, enhancing its ability to persistently track those objects missed by the detector, primarily due to occlusions. Remarkably, this is accomplished without modifying past tracking results or accessing future frames, i.e., in a fully online manner. BUSCA generates proposals based on neighboring tracks, motion, and learned tokens. Utilizing a decision Transformer that integrates multimodal visual and spatiotemporal information, it addresses the object-proposal association as a multi-choice question-answering task. BUSCA is trained independently of the underlying tracker, solely on synthetic data, without requiring fine-tuning. Through BUSCA, we showcase consistent performance enhancements across five different trackers and establish a new state-of-the-art baseline across three different benchmarks.

| **[Multi-State-Action Tokenisation in Decision Transformers for Multi-Discrete Action Spaces](https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01310v1)** | 2024-07-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Decision Transformers, in their vanilla form, struggle to perform on image-based environments with multi-discrete action spaces. Although enhanced Decision Transformer architectures have been developed to improve performance, these methods have not specifically addressed this problem of multi-discrete action spaces which hampers existing Decision Transformer architectures from learning good representations. To mitigate this, we propose Multi-State Action Tokenisation (M-SAT), an approach for tokenising actions in multi-discrete action spaces that enhances the model's performance in such environments. Our approach involves two key changes: disentangling actions to the individual action level and tokenising the actions with auxiliary state information. These two key changes also improve individual action level interpretability and visibility within the attention layers. We demonstrate the performance gains of M-SAT on challenging ViZDoom environments with multi-discrete action spaces and image-based state spaces, including the Deadly Corridor and My Way Home scenarios, where M-SAT outperforms the baseline Decision Transformer without any additional data or heavy computational overheads. Additionally, we find that removing positional encoding does not adversely affect M-SAT's performance and, in some cases, even improves it.</p></details> |  |
| **[Exploring a Physics-Informed Decision Transformer for Distribution System Restoration: Methodology and Performance Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00808v1)** | 2024-06-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Driven by advancements in sensing and computing, deep reinforcement learning (DRL)-based methods have demonstrated significant potential in effectively tackling distribution system restoration (DSR) challenges under uncertain operational scenarios. However, the data-intensive nature of DRL poses obstacles in achieving satisfactory DSR solutions for large-scale, complex distribution systems. Inspired by the transformative impact of emerging foundation models, including large language models (LLMs), across various domains, this paper explores an innovative approach harnessing LLMs' powerful computing capabilities to address scalability challenges inherent in conventional DRL methods for solving DSR. To our knowledge, this study represents the first exploration of foundation models, including LLMs, in revolutionizing conventional DRL applications in power system operations. Our contributions are twofold: 1) introducing a novel LLM-powered Physics-Informed Decision Transformer (PIDT) framework that leverages LLMs to transform conventional DRL methods for DSR operations, and 2) conducting comparative studies to assess the performance of the proposed LLM-powered PIDT framework at its initial development stage for solving DSR problems. While our primary focus in this paper is on DSR operations, the proposed PIDT framework can be generalized to optimize sequential decision-making across various power system operations.</p></details> |  |

| **[Sequential Recommendation for Optimizing Both Immediate Feedback and Long-term Retention](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03637v2)** | 2024-06-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the landscape of Recommender System (RS) applications, reinforcement learning (RL) has recently emerged as a powerful tool, primarily due to its proficiency in optimizing long-term rewards. Nevertheless, it suffers from instability in the learning process, stemming from the intricate interactions among bootstrapping, off-policy training, and function approximation. Moreover, in multi-reward recommendation scenarios, designing a proper reward setting that reconciles the inner dynamics of various tasks is quite intricate. In response to these challenges, we introduce DT4IER, an advanced decision transformer-based recommendation model that is engineered to not only elevate the effectiveness of recommendations but also to achieve a harmonious balance between immediate user engagement and long-term retention. The DT4IER applies an innovative multi-reward design that adeptly balances short and long-term rewards with user-specific attributes, which serve to enhance the contextual richness of the reward sequence ensuring a more informed and personalized recommendation process. To enhance its predictive capabilities, DT4IER incorporates a high-dimensional encoder, skillfully designed to identify and leverage the intricate interrelations across diverse tasks. Furthermore, we integrate a contrastive learning approach within the action embedding predictions, a strategy that significantly boosts the model's overall performance. Experiments on three real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of DT4IER against state-of-the-art Sequential Recommender Systems (SRSs) and Multi-Task Learning (MTL) models in terms of both prediction accuracy and effectiveness in specific tasks.

However, due to the typical limitations of simulation environments (e.g., data inefficiency), most of the work cannot be broadly applied in all domains. To counter these challenges, recent advancements have leveraged offline reinforcement learning methods, notable for their data-driven approach utilizing offline datasets. A prominent example of this is the Decision Transformer. Despite its popularity, the Decision Transformer approach has inherent drawbacks, particularly evident in recommendation methods based on it. This paper identifies two key shortcomings in existing Decision Transformer-based methods: a lack of stitching capability and limited effectiveness in online adoption. In response, we introduce a novel methodology named Max-Entropy enhanced Decision Transformer with Reward Relabeling for Offline RLRS (EDT4Rec). Our approach begins with a max entropy perspective, leading to the development of a max entropy enhanced exploration strategy. This strategy is designed to facilitate more effective exploration in online environments. Additionally, to augment the model's capability to stitch sub-optimal trajectories, we incorporate a unique reward relabeling technique. To validate the effectiveness and superiority of EDT4Rec, we have conducted comprehensive experiments across six real-world offline datasets and in an online simulator.</p></details> |  |

Transformer-based agents could emerge with self-improvement in online environments by providing task contexts, such as multiple trajectories, called in-context RL. However, due to the quadratic computation complexity of attention in transformers, current in-context RL methods suffer from huge computational costs as the task horizon increases. In contrast, the Mamba model is renowned for its efficient ability to process long-term dependencies, which provides an opportunity for in-context RL to solve tasks that require long-term memory. To this end, we first implement Decision Mamba (DM) by replacing the backbone of Decision Transformer (DT). Then, we propose a Decision Mamba-Hybrid (DM-H) with the merits of transformers and Mamba in high-quality prediction and long-term memory. Specifically, DM-H first generates high-value sub-goals from long-term memory through the Mamba model. Then, we use sub-goals to prompt the transformer, establishing high-quality predictions. Experimental results demonstrate that DM-H achieves state-of-the-art in long and short-term tasks, such as D4RL, Grid World, and Tmaze benchmarks. Regarding efficiency, the online testing of DM-H in the long-term task is 28$\times$ times faster than the transformer-based baselines.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2405.20692. arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2405.20692; text overlap with arXiv:2305.16554, arXiv:2210.14215 by other authors</p></details> |
| **[In-Context Decision Transformer: Reinforcement Learning via Hierarchical Chain-of-Thought](https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20692v1)** | 2024-05-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In-context learning is a promising approach for offline reinforcement learning (RL) to handle online tasks, which can be achieved by providing task prompts. Recent works demonstrated that in-context RL could emerge with self-improvement in a trial-and-error manner when treating RL tasks as an across-episodic sequential prediction problem. Despite the self-improvement not requiring gradient updates, current works still suffer from high computational costs when the across-episodic sequence increases with task horizons. To this end, we propose an In-context Decision Transformer (IDT) to achieve self-improvement in a high-level trial-and-error manner. Specifically, IDT is inspired by the efficient hierarchical structure of human decision-making and thus reconstructs the sequence to consist of high-level decisions instead of low-level actions that interact with environments. As one high-level decision can guide multi-step low-level actions, IDT naturally avoids excessively long sequences and solves online tasks more efficiently. Experimental results show that IDT achieves state-of-the-art in long-horizon tasks over current in-context RL methods. In particular, the online evaluation time of our IDT is \textbf{36$\times$} times faster than baselines in the D4RL benchmark and \textbf{27$\times$} times faster in the Grid World benchmark.</p></details> |  |

In offline reinforcement learning (RL), Decision Transformer (DT) is emerging as a promising model based on Transformer. However, we discovered that the attention module of DT is not appropriate to capture the inherent local dependence pattern in trajectories of RL modeled as a Markov decision process. To overcome the limitations of DT, we propose a novel action sequence predictor, named Decision ConvFormer (DC), based on the architecture of MetaFormer, which is a general structure to process multiple entities in parallel and understand the interrelationship among the multiple entities. DC employs local convolution filtering as the token mixer and can effectively capture the inherent local associations of the RL dataset. In extensive experiments, DC achieved state-of-the-art performance across various standard RL benchmarks while requiring fewer resources. Furthermore, we show that DC better understands the underlying meaning in data and exhibits enhanced generalization capability.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ICLR2024.

Learning-based methods have been recognized as an interesting paradigm and been increasingly investigated. However, existing approaches encounter difficulties in long-horizon goal-conditioned tasks due to the intricate compositional structure, which requires decision-making for a sequence of sub-steps and understanding of inherent dynamics of goal-reaching tasks. In this paper, we propose a new learning-based framework by leveraging the strong reasoning capability of the GPT-based architecture to automate surgical robotic tasks. The key to our approach is developing a goal-conditioned decision transformer to achieve sequential representations with goal-aware future indicators in order to enhance temporal reasoning. Moreover, considering to exploit a general understanding of dynamics inherent in manipulations, thus making the model's reasoning ability to be task-agnostic, we also design a cross-task pretraining paradigm that uses multiple training objectives associated with data from diverse tasks. We have conducted extensive experiments on 10 tasks using the surgical robot learning simulator SurRoL~\cite{long2023human}. The results show that our new approach achieves promising performance and task versatility compared to existing methods. The learned trajectories can be deployed on the da Vinci Research Kit (dVRK) for validating its practicality in real surgical robot settings.

| **[Think Before You Act: Decision Transformers with Working Memory](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.16338v3)** | 2024-05-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Decision Transformer-based decision-making agents have shown the ability to generalize across multiple tasks. However, their performance relies on massive data and computation. We argue that this inefficiency stems from the forgetting phenomenon, in which a model memorizes its behaviors in parameters throughout training. As a result, training on a new task may deteriorate the model's performance on previous tasks. In contrast to LLMs' implicit memory mechanism, the human brain utilizes distributed memory storage, which helps manage and organize multiple skills efficiently, mitigating the forgetting phenomenon. Inspired by this, we propose a working memory module to store, blend, and retrieve information for different downstream tasks. Evaluation results show that the proposed method improves training efficiency and generalization in Atari games and Meta-World object manipulation tasks. Moreover, we demonstrate that memory fine-tuning further enhances the adaptability of the proposed architecture.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ICML 2024</p></details> |

Recent advancements approach this through sequence modeling, leveraging the Transformer architecture's scalability and the benefits of parameter sharing to exploit task similarities. However, variations in task content and complexity pose significant challenges in policy formulation, necessitating judicious parameter sharing and management of conflicting gradients for optimal policy performance. In this work, we introduce the Harmony Multi-Task Decision Transformer (HarmoDT), a novel solution designed to identify an optimal harmony subspace of parameters for each task. We approach this as a bi-level optimization problem, employing a meta-learning framework that leverages gradient-based techniques. The upper level of this framework is dedicated to learning a task-specific mask that delineates the harmony subspace, while the inner level focuses on updating parameters to enhance the overall performance of the unified policy. Empirical evaluations on a series of benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of HarmoDT, verifying the effectiveness of our approach.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published at ICML 2024</p></details> |

A natural question to ask is whether this performance gain can only be achieved with language pre-training, or can be achieved with simpler pre-training schemes which do not involve language. In this paper, we first show that language is not essential for improved performance, and indeed pre-training with synthetic IID data for a small number of updates can match the performance gains from pre-training with a large language corpus; moreover, pre-training with data generated by a one-step Markov chain can further improve the performance. Inspired by these experimental results, we then consider pre-training Conservative Q-Learning (CQL), a popular offline DRL algorithm, which is Q-learning-based and typically employs a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) backbone. Surprisingly, pre-training with simple synthetic data for a small number of updates can also improve CQL, providing consistent performance improvement on D4RL Gym locomotion datasets. The results of this paper not only illustrate the importance of pre-training for offline DRL but also show that the pre-training data can be synthetic and generated with remarkably simple mechanisms.</p></details> | <details><summary>37 pa...</summary><p>37 pages, 17 figures; Published at ICLR 2024; Code: https://github.com/Victor-wang-902/synthetic-pretrain-rl</p></details> |

Meanwhile, Decision Transformer (DT) abstracts the RL as sequence modeling, showcasing competitive performance on offline RL benchmarks. However, recent studies demonstrate that DT lacks of stitching capacity, thus exploiting stitching capability for DT is vital to further improve its performance. In order to endow stitching capability to DT, we abstract trajectory stitching as expert matching and introduce our approach, ContextFormer, which integrates contextual information-based imitation learning (IL) and sequence modeling to stitch sub-optimal trajectory fragments by emulating the representations of a limited number of expert trajectories. To validate our approach, we conduct experiments from two perspectives: 1) We conduct extensive experiments on D4RL benchmarks under the settings of IL, and experimental results demonstrate ContextFormer can achieve competitive performance in multiple IL settings. 2) More importantly, we conduct a comparison of ContextFormer with various competitive DT variants using identical training datasets. The experimental results unveiled ContextFormer's superiority, as it outperformed all other variants, showcasing its remarkable performance.</p></details> |  |

However, the inherent variability in state variables and action spaces among personalized agents poses significant aggregation challenges for traditional federated learning algorithms. To tackle these challenges, we introduce the Federated Split Decision Transformer (FSDT), an innovative framework designed explicitly for AI agent decision tasks. The FSDT framework excels at navigating the intricacies of personalized agents by harnessing distributed data for training while preserving data privacy. It employs a two-stage training process, with local embedding and prediction models on client agents and a global transformer decoder model on the server. Our comprehensive evaluation using the benchmark D4RL dataset highlights the superior performance of our algorithm in federated split learning for personalized agents, coupled with significant reductions in communication and computational overhead compared to traditional centralized training approaches. The FSDT framework demonstrates strong potential for enabling efficient and privacy-preserving collaborative learning in applications such as autonomous driving decision systems.

| **[A Minimalist Prompt for Zero-Shot Policy Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06063v1)** | 2024-05-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Transformer-based methods have exhibited significant generalization ability when prompted with target-domain demonstrations or example solutions during inference. Although demonstrations, as a way of task specification, can capture rich information that may be hard to specify by language, it remains unclear what information is extracted from the demonstrations to help generalization. Moreover, assuming access to demonstrations of an unseen task is impractical or unreasonable in many real-world scenarios, especially in robotics applications. These questions motivate us to explore what the minimally sufficient prompt could be to elicit the same level of generalization ability as the demonstrations. We study this problem in the contextural RL setting which allows for quantitative measurement of generalization and is commonly adopted by meta-RL and multi-task RL benchmarks. In this setting, the training and test Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) only differ in certain properties, which we refer to as task parameters. We show that conditioning a decision transformer on these task parameters alone can enable zero-shot generalization on par with or better than its demonstration-conditioned counterpart. This suggests that task parameters are essential for the generalization and DT models are trying to recover it from the demonstration prompt. To extract the remaining generalizable information from the supervision, we introduce an additional learnable prompt which is demonstrated to further boost zero-shot generalization across a range of robotic control, manipulation, and navigation benchmark tasks.</p></details> |  |

However, CORL faces challenges in balancing stability and plasticity. Existing methods, employing Actor-Critic structures and experience replay (ER), suffer from distribution shifts, low efficiency, and weak knowledge-sharing. We aim to investigate whether Decision Transformer (DT), another offline RL paradigm, can serve as a more suitable offline continuous learner to address these issues. We first compare AC-based offline algorithms with DT in the CORL framework. DT offers advantages in learning efficiency, distribution shift mitigation, and zero-shot generalization but exacerbates the forgetting problem during supervised parameter updates. We introduce multi-head DT (MH-DT) and low-rank adaptation DT (LoRA-DT) to mitigate DT's forgetting problem. MH-DT stores task-specific knowledge using multiple heads, facilitating knowledge sharing with common components. It employs distillation and selective rehearsal to enhance current task learning when a replay buffer is available. In buffer-unavailable scenarios, LoRA-DT merges less influential weights and fine-tunes DT's decisive MLP layer to adapt to the current task. Extensive experiments on MoJuCo and Meta-World benchmarks demonstrate that our methods outperform SOTA CORL baselines and showcase enhanced learning capabilities and superior memory efficiency.</p></details> | 11 pages, 6 figures |

Moreover, it requires a delicate integration of controller and estimator designs to achieve the desired system behavior. To establish a general controller synthesis framework, we explore the Decision Transformer (DT) architecture. Specifically, we first frame the control task as predicting the current optimal action based on past observations, actions, and rewards, eliminating the need for a separate estimator design. Then, we leverage the pre-trained language models, i.e., the Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT) series, to initialize DT and subsequently train it for control tasks using low-rank adaptation (LoRA). Our comprehensive experiments across five distinct control tasks, ranging from maneuvering aerospace systems to controlling partial differential equations (PDEs), demonstrate DT's capability to capture the parameter-agnostic structures intrinsic to control tasks. DT exhibits remarkable zero-shot generalization abilities for completely new tasks and rapidly surpasses expert performance levels with a minimal amount of demonstration data.

Yet, they grapple with challenges, notably in crafting reward functions and harnessing large pre-existing datasets within the RL framework. Recent advancements in offline RLRS provide a solution for how to address these two challenges. However, existing methods mainly rely on the transformer architecture, which, as sequence lengths increase, can introduce challenges associated with computational resources and training costs. Additionally, the prevalent methods employ fixed-length input trajectories, restricting their capacity to capture evolving user preferences. In this study, we introduce a new offline RLRS method to deal with the above problems. We reinterpret the RLRS challenge by modeling sequential decision-making as an inference task, leveraging adaptive masking configurations. This adaptive approach selectively masks input tokens, transforming the recommendation task into an inference challenge based on varying token subsets, thereby enhancing the agent's ability to infer across diverse trajectory lengths. Furthermore, we incorporate a multi-scale segmented retention mechanism that facilitates efficient modeling of long sequences, significantly enhancing computational efficiency. Our experimental analysis, conducted on both online simulator and offline datasets, clearly demonstrates the advantages of our proposed method.</p></details> |  |

Three popular algorithms for offline RL are Conservative Q-Learning (CQL), Behavior Cloning (BC), and Decision Transformer (DT), from the class of Q-Learning, Imitation Learning, and Sequence Modeling respectively. A key open question is: which algorithm is preferred under what conditions? We study this question empirically by exploring the performance of these algorithms across the commonly used D4RL and Robomimic benchmarks. We design targeted experiments to understand their behavior concerning data suboptimality, task complexity, and stochasticity. Our key findings are: (1) DT requires more data than CQL to learn competitive policies but is more robust; (2) DT is a substantially better choice than both CQL and BC in sparse-reward and low-quality data settings; (3) DT and BC are preferable as task horizon increases, or when data is obtained from human demonstrators; and (4) CQL excels in situations characterized by the combination of high stochasticity and low data quality. We also investigate architectural choices and scaling trends for DT on Atari and D4RL and make design/scaling recommendations. We find that scaling the amount of data for DT by 5x gives a 2.5x average score improvement on Atari.</p></details> | <details><summary>Inter...</summary><p>International Conference on Learning Representations (ICLR) 2024</p></details> |

For this reason, it is crucial to find mechanisms for adapting reinforcement learning techniques to the constraints imposed by lower computational power and smaller memory capacities of these ultra low-cost robotic platforms. We try to address this need by proposing a method for making imitation learning deployable onto resource-constrained robotic platforms. Here we cast the imitation learning problem as a conditional sequence modeling task and we train a decision transformer using expert demonstrations augmented with a custom reward. Then, we compress the resulting generative model using software optimization schemes, including quantization and pruning. We test our method in simulation using Isaac Gym, a realistic physics simulation environment designed for reinforcement learning. We empirically demonstrate that our method achieves natural looking gaits for Bittle, a resource-constrained quadruped robot. We also run multiple simulations to show the effects of pruning and quantization on the performance of the model. Our results show that quantization (down to 4 bits) and pruning reduce model size by around 30\% while maintaining a competitive reward, making the model deployable in a resource-constrained system.</p></details> | 10 pages, 4 figures |

We first introduce a quality of experience (QoE) metric to measure user experience, which considers the MEC system's latency, user attention levels, and preferred resolutions. Then, a QoE maximization problem is formulated for resource allocation to ensure the highest possible user experience,which is cast as a reinforcement learning problem, aiming to learn a generalized policy applicable across diverse user environments for all MEC servers. To learn the generalized policy, we propose a framework that employs federated learning (FL) and prompt-based sequence modeling to pre-train a common decision model across MEC servers, which is named FedPromptDT. Using FL solves the problem of insufficient local MEC data while protecting user privacy during offline training. The design of prompts integrating user-environment cues and user-preferred allocation improves the model's adaptability to various user environments during online execution.</p></details> |  |
| **[Limitations of Agents Simulated by Predictive Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.05829v1)** | 2024-02-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>There is increasing focus on adapting predictive models into agent-like systems, most notably AI assistants based on language models. We outline two structural reasons for why these models can fail when turned into agents. First, we discuss auto-suggestive delusions. Prior work has shown theoretically that models fail to imitate agents that generated the training data if the agents relied on hidden observations: the hidden observations act as confounding variables, and the models treat actions they generate as evidence for nonexistent observations. Second, we introduce and formally study a related, novel limitation: predictor-policy incoherence. When a model generates a sequence of actions, the model's implicit prediction of the policy that generated those actions can serve as a confounding variable. The result is that models choose actions as if they expect future actions to be suboptimal, causing them to be overly conservative. We show that both of those failures are fixed by including a feedback loop from the environment, that is, re-training the models on their own actions. We give simple demonstrations of both limitations using Decision Transformers and confirm that empirical results agree with our conceptual and formal analysis. Our treatment provides a unifying view of those failure modes, and informs the question of why fine-tuning offline learned policies with online learning makes them more effective.</p></details> |  |

However, DT generates actions conditioned on a desired future return, which is known to bear some weaknesses such as the susceptibility to environmental stochasticity. To overcome DT's weaknesses, we propose to empower DT with dynamic programming. Our method comprises three steps. First, we employ in-sample value iteration to obtain approximated value functions, which involves dynamic programming over the MDP structure. Second, we evaluate action quality in context with estimated advantages. We introduce two types of advantage estimators, IAE and GAE, which are suitable for different tasks. Third, we train an Advantage-Conditioned Transformer (ACT) to generate actions conditioned on the estimated advantages. Finally, during testing, ACT generates actions conditioned on a desired advantage. Our evaluation results validate that, by leveraging the power of dynamic programming, ACT demonstrates effective trajectory stitching and robust action generation in spite of the environmental stochasticity, outperforming baseline methods across various benchmarks. Additionally, we conduct an in-depth analysis of ACT's various design choices through ablation studies. Our code is available at https://github.com/LAMDA-RL/ACT.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by AAAI 2024</p></details> |

Inspired by recent advances in foundation models for vision and language, we propose a multi-embodiment, multi-task generalist agent for robotic manipulation. This agent, named RoboCat, is a visual goal-conditioned decision transformer capable of consuming action-labelled visual experience. This data spans a large repertoire of motor control skills from simulated and real robotic arms with varying sets of observations and actions. With RoboCat, we demonstrate the ability to generalise to new tasks and robots, both zero-shot as well as through adaptation using only 100-1000 examples for the target task. We also show how a trained model itself can be used to generate data for subsequent training iterations, thus providing a basic building block for an autonomous improvement loop. We investigate the agent's capabilities, with large-scale evaluations both in simulation and on three different real robot embodiments. We find that as we grow and diversify its training data, RoboCat not only shows signs of cross-task transfer, but also becomes more efficient at adapting to new tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Trans...</summary><p>Transactions on Machine Learning Research (12/2023)</p></details> |
| **[Critic-Guided Decision Transformer for Offline Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.13716v1)** | 2023-12-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in offline reinforcement learning (RL) have underscored the capabilities of Return-Conditioned Supervised Learning (RCSL), a paradigm that learns the action distribution based on target returns for each state in a supervised manner. However, prevailing RCSL methods largely focus on deterministic trajectory modeling, disregarding stochastic state transitions and the diversity of future trajectory distributions. A fundamental challenge arises from the inconsistency between the sampled returns within individual trajectories and the expected returns across multiple trajectories. Fortunately, value-based methods offer a solution by leveraging a value function to approximate the expected returns, thereby addressing the inconsistency effectively. Building upon these insights, we propose a novel approach, termed the Critic-Guided Decision Transformer (CGDT), which combines the predictability of long-term returns from value-based methods with the trajectory modeling capability of the Decision Transformer. By incorporating a learned value function, known as the critic, CGDT ensures a direct alignment between the specified target returns and the expected returns of actions. This integration bridges the gap between the deterministic nature of RCSL and the probabilistic characteristics of value-based methods. Empirical evaluations on stochastic environments and D4RL benchmark datasets demonstrate the superiority of CGDT over traditional RCSL methods. These results highlight the potential of CGDT to advance the state of the art in offline RL and extend the applicability of RCSL to a wide range of RL tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at AAAI 2024</p></details> |
| **[Real-time Network Intrusion Detection via Decision Transformers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.07696v2)** | 2023-12-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Many cybersecurity problems that require real-time decision-making based on temporal observations can be abstracted as a sequence modeling problem, e.g., network intrusion detection from a sequence of arriving packets. Existing approaches like reinforcement learning may not be suitable for such cybersecurity decision problems, since the Markovian property may not necessarily hold and the underlying network states are often not observable. In this paper, we cast the problem of real-time network intrusion detection as casual sequence modeling and draw upon the power of the transformer architecture for real-time decision-making. By conditioning a causal decision transformer on past trajectories, consisting of the rewards, network packets, and detection decisions, our proposed framework will generate future detection decisions to achieve the desired return. It enables decision transformers to be applied to real-time network intrusion detection, as well as a novel tradeoff between the accuracy and timeliness of detection. The proposed solution is evaluated on public network intrusion detection datasets and outperforms several baseline algorithms using reinforcement learning and sequence modeling, in terms of detection accuracy and timeliness.</p></details> |  |

The dynamic nature of traffic flow has prompted researchers to explore Reinforcement Learning (RL) for traffic signal control (TSC). Compared with traditional methods, RL-based solutions have shown preferable performance. However, the application of RL-based traffic signal controllers in the real world is limited by the low sample efficiency and high computational requirements of these solutions. In this work, we propose DTLight, a simple yet powerful lightweight Decision Transformer-based TSC method that can learn policy from easily accessible offline datasets. DTLight novelly leverages knowledge distillation to learn a lightweight controller from a well-trained larger teacher model to reduce implementation computation. Additionally, it integrates adapter modules to mitigate the expenses associated with fine-tuning, which makes DTLight practical for online adaptation with minimal computation and only a few fine-tuning steps during real deployment. Moreover, DTLight is further enhanced to be more applicable to real-world TSC problems. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world scenarios show that DTLight pre-trained purely on offline datasets can outperform state-of-the-art online RL-based methods in most scenarios. Experiment results also show that online fine-tuning further improves the performance of DTLight by up to 42.6% over the best online RL baseline methods. In this work, we also introduce Datasets specifically designed for TSC with offline RL (referred to as DTRL). Our datasets and code are publicly available.</p></details> |  |

Leveraging Natural Language Feedback in Goal-Conditioned Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04736v1)** | 2023-12-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite numerous successes, the field of reinforcement learning (RL) remains far from matching the impressive generalisation power of human behaviour learning. One possible way to help bridge this gap be to provide RL agents with richer, more human-like feedback expressed in natural language. To investigate this idea, we first extend BabyAI to automatically generate language feedback from the environment dynamics and goal condition success. Then, we modify the Decision Transformer architecture to take advantage of this additional signal. We find that training with language feedback either in place of or in addition to the return-to-go or goal descriptions improves agents' generalisation performance, and that agents can benefit from feedback even when this is only available during training, but not at inference.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at Workshop on Goal-conditioned Reinforcement Learning, NeurIPS 2023</p></details> |

The root cause of this underperformance lies in their inability to seamlessly connect segments of suboptimal trajectories. To overcome this limitation, we present a novel approach to enhance RvS methods by integrating intermediate targets. We introduce the Waypoint Transformer (WT), using an architecture that builds upon the DT framework and conditioned on automatically-generated waypoints. The results show a significant increase in the final return compared to existing RvS methods, with performance on par or greater than existing state-of-the-art temporal difference learning-based methods. Additionally, the performance and stability improvements are largest in the most challenging environments and data configurations, including AntMaze Large Play/Diverse and Kitchen Mixed/Partial.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to the Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems 2023 (NeurIPS 2023)</p></details> |

We address these challenges by proposing Language Decision Transformers (LDTs), a framework that is based on transformer language models and decision transformers (DTs). Our LDTs extend DTs with 3 components: (1) exponential tilt to guide the agent towards high obtainable goals, (2) novel goal conditioning methods yielding better results than the traditional return-to-go (sum of all future rewards), and (3) a model of future observations that improves agent performance. LDTs are the first to address offline RL with DTs on these challenging games. Our experiments show that LDTs achieve the highest scores among many different types of agents on some of the most challenging Jericho games, such as Enchanter.</p></details> | <details><summary>19 pa...</summary><p>19 pages, 6 figures, 5 tables</p></details> |

The advent of Artificial Intelligence (AI) is bringing in a personal choice revolution, wherein AI-driven individual decisions transform food systems from dinner tables, to the farms, and back to our plates. In this context, AI algorithms refine personal dietary choices, subsequently shaping agricultural outputs, and promoting an optimized feedback loop from consumption to cultivation. Initially, we delve into AI tools and techniques spanning the food supply chain, and subsequently assess how AI subfields$\unicode{x2013}$encompassing machine learning, computer vision, and speech recognition$\unicode{x2013}$are harnessed within the AI-enabled Food System (AIFS) framework, which increasingly leverages Internet of Things, multimodal sensors and real-time data exchange. We spotlight the AIFS framework, emphasizing its fusion of AI with technologies such as digitalization, big data analytics, biotechnology, and IoT extensively used in modern food systems in every component. This paradigm shifts the conventional "farm to fork" narrative to a cyclical "consumer-driven farm to fork" model for better achieving sustainable, nutritious diets. This paper explores AI's promise and the intrinsic challenges it poses within the food domain. By championing stringent AI governance, uniform data architectures, and cross-disciplinary partnerships, we argue that AI, when synergized with consumer-centric strategies, holds the potential to steer food systems toward a sustainable trajectory. We furnish a comprehensive survey for the state-of-the-art in diverse facets of food systems, subsequently pinpointing gaps and advocating for the judicious and efficacious deployment of emergent AI methodologies.</p></details> |  |
| **[Rethinking Decision Transformer via Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.00267v1)** | 2023-11-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Decision Transformer (DT) is an innovative algorithm leveraging recent advances of the transformer architecture in reinforcement learning (RL). However, a notable limitation of DT is its reliance on recalling trajectories from datasets, losing the capability to seamlessly stitch sub-optimal trajectories together. In this work we introduce a general sequence modeling framework for studying sequential decision making through the lens of Hierarchical RL. At the time of making decisions, a high-level policy first proposes an ideal prompt for the current state, a low-level policy subsequently generates an action conditioned on the given prompt. We show DT emerges as a special case of this framework with certain choices of high-level and low-level policies, and discuss the potential failure of these choices. Inspired by these observations, we study how to jointly optimize the high-level and low-level policies to enable the stitching ability, which further leads to the development of new offline RL algorithms. Our empirical results clearly show that the proposed algorithms significantly surpass DT on several control and navigation benchmarks. We hope our contributions can inspire the integration of transformer architectures within the field of RL.</p></details> |  |
| **[Elastic Decision Transformer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.02484v6)** | 2023-10-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper introduces Elastic Decision Transformer (EDT), a significant advancement over the existing Decision Transformer (DT) and its variants. Although DT purports to generate an optimal trajectory, empirical evidence suggests it struggles with trajectory stitching, a process involving the generation of an optimal or near-optimal trajectory from the best parts of a set of sub-optimal trajectories. The proposed EDT differentiates itself by facilitating trajectory stitching during action inference at test time, achieved by adjusting the history length maintained in DT. Further, the EDT optimizes the trajectory by retaining a longer history when the previous trajectory is optimal and a shorter one when it is sub-optimal, enabling it to "stitch" with a more optimal trajectory. Extensive experimentation demonstrates EDT's ability to bridge the performance gap between DT-based and Q Learning-based approaches. In particular, the EDT outperforms Q Learning-based methods in a multi-task regime on the D4RL locomotion benchmark and Atari games.

When learning from scratch, safe RL agents tend to be overly conservative, which impedes exploration and restrains the overall performance. In many realistic tasks, e.g. autonomous driving, large-scale expert demonstration data are available. We argue that extracting expert policy from offline data to guide online exploration is a promising solution to mitigate the conserveness issue. Large-capacity models, e.g. decision transformers (DT), have been proven to be competent in offline policy learning. However, data collected in real-world scenarios rarely contain dangerous cases (e.g., collisions), which makes it prohibitive for the policies to learn safety concepts. Besides, these bulk policy networks cannot meet the computation speed requirements at inference time on real-world tasks such as autonomous driving. To this end, we propose Guided Online Distillation (GOLD), an offline-to-online safe RL framework. GOLD distills an offline DT policy into a lightweight policy network through guided online safe RL training, which outperforms both the offline DT policy and online safe RL algorithms. Experiments in both benchmark safe RL tasks and real-world driving tasks based on the Waymo Open Motion Dataset (WOMD) demonstrate that GOLD can successfully distill lightweight policies and solve decision-making problems in challenging safety-critical scenarios.</p></details> |  |

Our model uses a decision transformer to learn a sequence of editing actions that maximizes query retrieval metrics such as mean average precision. We conduct a series of experiments showing that our query rewriting system achieves a relative increase in the effectiveness of the queries of up to 42%, while producing editing action sequences that are human interpretable.</p></details> | <details><summary>AACL ...</summary><p>AACL 2023 (long paper)</p></details> |

To create such models, we generally require centralized training objectives, data, and compute. It is of interest if we can more flexibly create generalist policies by merging together multiple, task-specific, individually trained policies. In this work, we take a preliminary step in this direction through merging, or averaging, subsets of Decision Transformers in parameter space trained on different MuJoCo locomotion problems, forming multi-task models without centralized training. We also demonstrate the importance of various methodological choices when merging policies, such as utilizing common pre-trained initializations, increasing model capacity, and utilizing Fisher information for weighting parameter importance. In general, we believe research in this direction could help democratize and distribute the process that forms multi-task robotics policies. Our implementation is available at https://github.com/daniellawson9999/merging-decision-transformers.</p></details> |  |
| **[The Quality-Diversity Transformer: Generating Behavior-Conditioned Trajectories with Decision Transformers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.16207v3)** | 2023-09-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the context of neuroevolution, Quality-Diversity algorithms have proven effective in generating repertoires of diverse and efficient policies by relying on the definition of a behavior space. A natural goal induced by the creation of such a repertoire is trying to achieve behaviors on demand, which can be done by running the corresponding policy from the repertoire. However, in uncertain environments, two problems arise. First, policies can lack robustness and repeatability, meaning that multiple episodes under slightly different conditions often result in very different behaviors. Second, due to the discrete nature of the repertoire, solutions vary discontinuously. Here we present a new approach to achieve behavior-conditioned trajectory generation based on two mechanisms: First, MAP-Elites Low-Spread (ME-LS), which constrains the selection of solutions to those that are the most consistent in the behavior space. Second, the Quality-Diversity Transformer (QDT), a Transformer-based model conditioned on continuous behavior descriptors, which trains on a dataset generated by policies from a ME-LS repertoire and learns to autoregressively generate sequences of actions that achieve target behaviors. Results show that ME-LS produces consistent and robust policies, and that its combination with the QDT yields a single policy capable of achieving diverse behaviors on demand with high accuracy.</p></details> | 10+7 pages |
| **[Multi-Objective Decision Transformers for Offline Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.16379v1)** | 2023-08-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Offline Reinforcement Learning (RL) is structured to derive policies from static trajectory data without requiring real-time environment interactions. Recent studies have shown the feasibility of framing offline RL as a sequence modeling task, where the sole aim is to predict actions based on prior context using the transformer architecture. However, the limitation of this single task learning approach is its potential to undermine the transformer model's attention mechanism, which should ideally allocate varying attention weights across different tokens in the input context for optimal prediction. To address this, we reformulate offline RL as a multi-objective optimization problem, where the prediction is extended to states and returns. We also highlight a potential flaw in the trajectory representation used for sequence modeling, which could generate inaccuracies when modeling the state and return distributions. This is due to the non-smoothness of the action distribution within the trajectory dictated by the behavioral policy. To mitigate this issue, we introduce action space regions to the trajectory representation. Our experiments on D4RL benchmark locomotion tasks reveal that our propositions allow for more effective utilization of the attention mechanism in the transformer model, resulting in performance that either matches or outperforms current state-of-the art methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[Statistically Efficient Variance Reduction with Double Policy Estimation for Off-Policy Evaluation in Sequence-Modeled Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.14897v1)** | 2023-08-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Offline reinforcement learning aims to utilize datasets of previously gathered environment-action interaction records to learn a policy without access to the real environment. Recent work has shown that offline reinforcement learning can be formulated as a sequence modeling problem and solved via supervised learning with approaches such as decision transformer. While these sequence-based methods achieve competitive results over return-to-go methods, especially on tasks that require longer episodes or with scarce rewards, importance sampling is not considered to correct the policy bias when dealing with off-policy data, mainly due to the absence of behavior policy and the use of deterministic evaluation policies. To this end, we propose DPE: an RL algorithm that blends offline sequence modeling and offline reinforcement learning with Double Policy Estimation (DPE) in a unified framework with statistically proven properties on variance reduction. We validate our method in multiple tasks of OpenAI Gym with D4RL benchmarks. Our method brings a performance improvements on selected methods which outperforms SOTA baselines in several tasks, demonstrating the advantages of enabling double policy estimation for sequence-modeled reinforcement learning.</p></details> |  |
| **[Causal Decision Transformer for Recommender Systems via Offline Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.07920v2)** | 2023-08-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement learning-based recommender systems have recently gained popularity. However, the design of the reward function, on which the agent relies to optimize its recommendation policy, is often not straightforward. Exploring the causality underlying users' behavior can take the place of the reward function in guiding the agent to capture the dynamic interests of users. Moreover, due to the typical limitations of simulation environments (e.g., data inefficiency), most of the work cannot be broadly applied in large-scale situations. Although some works attempt to convert the offline dataset into a simulator, data inefficiency makes the learning process even slower. Because of the nature of reinforcement learning (i.e., learning by interaction), it cannot collect enough data to train during a single interaction. Furthermore, traditional reinforcement learning algorithms do not have a solid capability like supervised learning methods to learn from offline datasets directly. In this paper, we propose a new model named the causal decision transformer for recommender systems (CDT4Rec). CDT4Rec is an offline reinforcement learning system that can learn from a dataset rather than from online interaction. Moreover, CDT4Rec employs the transformer architecture, which is capable of processing large offline datasets and capturing both short-term and long-term dependencies within the data to estimate the causal relationship between action, state, and reward. To demonstrate the feasibility and superiority of our model, we have conducted experiments on six real-world offline datasets and one online simulator.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by SIGIR'23, please check the camera-ready version for more details such as the implementation</p></details> |

Such archives are usually composed of a finite number of reactive agents which are each associated to a unique behavior descriptor, and instantiating behavior descriptors outside of that coarsely discretized space is not straight-forward. While a few recent works suggest solutions to that issue, the trajectory that is generated is not easily customizable beyond the specification of a target behavior descriptor. We propose to jointly solve those problems in environments where semantic information about static scene elements is available by leveraging a Large Language Model to augment the repertoire with natural language descriptions of trajectories, and training a policy conditioned on those descriptions. Thus, our method allows a user to not only specify an arbitrary target behavior descriptor, but also provide the model with a high-level textual prompt to shape the generated trajectory. We also propose an LLM-based approach to evaluating the performance of such generative agents. Furthermore, we develop a benchmark based on simulated robot navigation in a 2d maze that we use for experimental validation.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages, 9 figures, 2 tables</p></details> |
| **[Karma: Adaptive Video Streaming via Causal Sequence Modeling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.10230v1)** | 2023-08-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Optimal adaptive bitrate (ABR) decision depends on a comprehensive characterization of state transitions that involve interrelated modalities over time including environmental observations, returns, and actions. However, state-of-the-art learning-based ABR algorithms solely rely on past observations to decide the next action. This paradigm tends to cause a chain of deviations from optimal action when encountering unfamiliar observations, which consequently undermines the model generalization. This paper presents Karma, an ABR algorithm that utilizes causal sequence modeling to improve generalization by comprehending the interrelated causality among past observations, returns, and actions and timely refining action when deviation occurs. Unlike direct observation-to-action mapping, Karma recurrently maintains a multi-dimensional time series of observations, returns, and actions as input and employs causal sequence modeling via a decision transformer to determine the next action. In the input sequence, Karma uses the maximum cumulative future quality of experience (QoE) (a.k.a, QoE-to-go) as an extended return signal, which is periodically estimated based on current network conditions and playback status. We evaluate Karma through trace-driven simulations and real-world field tests, demonstrating superior performance compared to existing state-of-the-art ABR algorithms, with an average QoE improvement ranging from 10.8% to 18.7% across diverse network conditions. Furthermore, Karma exhibits strong generalization capabilities, showing leading performance under unseen networks in both simulations and real-world tests.</p></details> |  |

However, a challenge that often arises is the trade-off between both the computational efficiency of the decision-making process and the ability of the learned agent to solve a particular task. This is particularly critical in real-time settings such as video games where the agent needs to take relevant decisions at a very high frequency, with a very limited inference time. In this work, we propose a generic offline learning approach where the computation cost of the input features is taken into account. We derive the Budgeted Decision Transformer as an extension of the Decision Transformer that incorporates cost constraints to limit its cost at inference. As a result, the model can dynamically choose the best input features at each timestep. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on several tasks, including D4RL benchmarks and complex 3D environments similar to those found in video games, and show that it can achieve similar performance while using significantly fewer computational resources compared to classical approaches.</p></details> |  |

While the application of foundation models to RL has received considerable attention, most approaches rely on either (1) the curation of expert demonstrations (either through manual design or task-specific pretraining) or (2) adaptation to the task of interest using gradient methods (either fine-tuning or training of adapter layers). Both of these techniques have drawbacks. Collecting demonstrations is labor-intensive, and algorithms that rely on them do not outperform the experts from which the demonstrations were derived. All gradient techniques are inherently slow, sacrificing the "few-shot" quality that made in-context learning attractive to begin with. In this work, we present an algorithm, ICPI, that learns to perform RL tasks without expert demonstrations or gradients. Instead we present a policy-iteration method in which the prompt content is the entire locus of learning. ICPI iteratively updates the contents of the prompt from which it derives its policy through trial-and-error interaction with an RL environment. In order to eliminate the role of in-weights learning (on which approaches like Decision Transformer rely heavily), we demonstrate our algorithm using Codex, a language model with no prior knowledge of the domains on which we evaluate it.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 4 figures, submitted to ICLR 2023</p></details> |

Recent works have shown that reinforcement learning (RL) can improve human performance in chip placement. However, such an RL-based approach suffers from long training time and low transfer ability in unseen chip circuits. To resolve these challenges, we cast the chip placement as an offline RL formulation and present ChiPFormer that enables learning a transferable placement policy from fixed offline data. ChiPFormer has several advantages that prior arts do not have. First, ChiPFormer can exploit offline placement designs to learn transferable policies more efficiently in a multi-task setting. Second, ChiPFormer can promote effective finetuning for unseen chip circuits, reducing the placement runtime from hours to minutes. Third, extensive experiments on 32 chip circuits demonstrate that ChiPFormer achieves significantly better placement quality while reducing the runtime by 10x compared to recent state-of-the-art approaches in both public benchmarks and realistic industrial tasks.

| **[Constrained Decision Transformer for Offline Safe Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.07351v2)** | 2023-06-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Safe reinforcement learning (RL) trains a constraint satisfaction policy by interacting with the environment. We aim to tackle a more challenging problem: learning a safe policy from an offline dataset. We study the offline safe RL problem from a novel multi-objective optimization perspective and propose the $ε$-reducible concept to characterize problem difficulties. The inherent trade-offs between safety and task performance inspire us to propose the constrained decision transformer (CDT) approach, which can dynamically adjust the trade-offs during deployment. Extensive experiments show the advantages of the proposed method in learning an adaptive, safe, robust, and high-reward policy. CDT outperforms its variants and strong offline safe RL baselines by a large margin with the same hyperparameters across all tasks, while keeping the zero-shot adaptation capability to different constraint thresholds, making our approach more suitable for real-world RL under constraints.

Since transformers are parameter-heavy, cannot benefit from history longer than a fixed window size, and are not computed using recurrence, we set out to investigate the suitability of the S4 family of models, which are based on state-space layers and have been shown to outperform transformers, especially in modeling long-range dependencies. In this work we present two main algorithms: (i) an off-policy training procedure that works with trajectories, while still maintaining the training efficiency of the S4 model. (ii) An on-policy training procedure that is trained in a recurrent manner, benefits from long-range dependencies, and is based on a novel stable actor-critic mechanism. Our results indicate that our method outperforms multiple variants of decision transformers, as well as the other baseline methods on most tasks, while reducing the latency, number of parameters, and training time by several orders of magnitude, making our approach more suitable for real-world RL.</p></details> | 21 pages,13 figures |
| **[Future-conditioned Unsupervised Pretraining for Decision Transformer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.16683v1)** | 2023-05-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent research in offline reinforcement learning (RL) has demonstrated that return-conditioned supervised learning is a powerful paradigm for decision-making problems. While promising, return conditioning is limited to training data labeled with rewards and therefore faces challenges in learning from unsupervised data. In this work, we aim to utilize generalized future conditioning to enable efficient unsupervised pretraining from reward-free and sub-optimal offline data. We propose Pretrained Decision Transformer (PDT), a conceptually simple approach for unsupervised RL pretraining. PDT leverages future trajectory information as a privileged context to predict actions during training. The ability to make decisions based on both present and future factors enhances PDT's capability for generalization. Besides, this feature can be easily incorporated into a return-conditioned framework for online finetuning, by assigning return values to possible futures and sampling future embeddings based on their respective values. Empirically, PDT outperforms or performs on par with its supervised pretraining counterpart, especially when dealing with sub-optimal data. Further analysis reveals that PDT can extract diverse behaviors from offline data and controllably sample high-return behaviors by online finetuning.

| **[Q-learning Decision Transformer: Leveraging Dynamic Programming for Conditional Sequence Modelling in Offline RL](https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.03993v4)** | 2023-05-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent works have shown that tackling offline reinforcement learning (RL) with a conditional policy produces promising results. The Decision Transformer (DT) combines the conditional policy approach and a transformer architecture, showing competitive performance against several benchmarks. However, DT lacks stitching ability -- one of the critical abilities for offline RL to learn the optimal policy from sub-optimal trajectories. This issue becomes particularly significant when the offline dataset only contains sub-optimal trajectories. On the other hand, the conventional RL approaches based on Dynamic Programming (such as Q-learning) do not have the same limitation; however, they suffer from unstable learning behaviours, especially when they rely on function approximation in an off-policy learning setting. In this paper, we propose the Q-learning Decision Transformer (QDT) to address the shortcomings of DT by leveraging the benefits of Dynamic Programming (Q-learning). It utilises the Dynamic Programming results to relabel the return-to-go in the training data to then train the DT with the relabelled data. Our approach efficiently exploits the benefits of these two approaches and compensates for each other's shortcomings to achieve better performance. We empirically show these in both simple toy environments and the more complex D4RL benchmark, showing competitive performance gains.</p></details> |  |
| **[Prompt-Tuning Decision Transformer with Preference Ranking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.09648v1)** | 2023-05-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Prompt-tuning has emerged as a promising method for adapting pre-trained models to downstream tasks or aligning with human preferences. Prompt learning is widely used in NLP but has limited applicability to RL due to the complex physical meaning and environment-specific information contained within RL prompts. These factors require supervised learning to imitate the demonstrations and may result in a loss of meaning after learning. Additionally, directly extending prompt-tuning approaches to RL is challenging because RL prompts guide agent behavior based on environmental modeling and analysis, rather than filling in missing information, making it unlikely that adjustments to the prompt format for downstream tasks, as in NLP, can yield significant improvements. In this work, we propose the Prompt-Tuning DT algorithm to address these challenges by using trajectory segments as prompts to guide RL agents in acquiring environmental information and optimizing prompts via black-box tuning to enhance their ability to contain more relevant information, thereby enabling agents to make better decisions. Our approach involves randomly sampling a Gaussian distribution to fine-tune the elements of the prompt trajectory and using preference ranking function to find the optimization direction, thereby providing more informative prompts and guiding the agent towards specific preferences in the target environment. Extensive experiments show that with only 0.03% of the parameters learned, Prompt-Tuning DT achieves comparable or even better performance than full-model fine-tuning in low-data scenarios. Our work contributes to the advancement of prompt-tuning approaches in RL, providing a promising direction for optimizing large RL agents for specific preference tasks.</p></details> | 18 pages |

However, the scalability of existing Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) methods based on SG is severely constrained by network structures or environmental limitations. To address this issue, we propose the Stackelberg Decision Transformer (STEER), a heuristic approach that resolves the difficulties of hierarchical coordination among agents. STEER efficiently manages decision-making processes in both spatial and temporal contexts by incorporating the hierarchical decision structure of SG, the modeling capability of autoregressive sequence models, and the exploratory learning methodology of MARL. Our research contributes to the development of an effective and adaptable asynchronous action coordination method that can be widely applied to various task types and environmental configurations in MAS. Experimental results demonstrate that our method can converge to Stackelberg equilibrium solutions and outperforms other existing methods in complex scenarios.</p></details> | 11pages, 7papers |

In practice, an agent's preferences over the objectives may not be known apriori, and hence, we require policies that can generalize to arbitrary preferences at test time. In this work, we propose a new data-driven setup for offline MORL, where we wish to learn a preference-agnostic policy agent using only a finite dataset of offline demonstrations of other agents and their preferences. The key contributions of this work are two-fold. First, we introduce D4MORL, (D)atasets for MORL that are specifically designed for offline settings. It contains 1.8 million annotated demonstrations obtained by rolling out reference policies that optimize for randomly sampled preferences on 6 MuJoCo environments with 2-3 objectives each. Second, we propose Pareto-Efficient Decision Agents (PEDA), a family of offline MORL algorithms that builds and extends Decision Transformers via a novel preference-and-return-conditioned policy. Empirically, we show that PEDA closely approximates the behavioral policy on the D4MORL benchmark and provides an excellent approximation of the Pareto-front with appropriate conditioning, as measured by the hypervolume and sparsity metrics.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in ICLR 2023</p></details> |

Decision Transformer is a step towards this direction, showing how to train transformers with a similar next-step prediction objective on offline data. Another important development in this area is the recent emergence of large-scale datasets collected from the internet, such as the ones composed of tutorial videos with captions where people talk about what they are doing. To take advantage of this language component, we propose a novel method for unifying language reasoning with actions in a single policy. Specifically, we augment a transformer policy with word outputs, so it can generate textual captions interleaved with actions. When tested on the most challenging task in BabyAI, with captions describing next subgoals, our reasoning policy consistently outperforms the caption-free baseline.</p></details> |  |
| **[Hyper-Decision Transformer for Efficient Online Policy Adaptation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.08487v1)** | 2023-04-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Decision Transformers (DT) have demonstrated strong performances in offline reinforcement learning settings, but quickly adapting to unseen novel tasks remains challenging. To address this challenge, we propose a new framework, called Hyper-Decision Transformer (HDT), that can generalize to novel tasks from a handful of demonstrations in a data- and parameter-efficient manner. To achieve such a goal, we propose to augment the base DT with an adaptation module, whose parameters are initialized by a hyper-network. When encountering unseen tasks, the hyper-network takes a handful of demonstrations as inputs and initializes the adaptation module accordingly. This initialization enables HDT to efficiently adapt to novel tasks by only fine-tuning the adaptation module. We validate HDT's generalization capability on object manipulation tasks. We find that with a single expert demonstration and fine-tuning only 0.5% of DT parameters, HDT adapts faster to unseen tasks than fine-tuning the whole DT model. Finally, we explore a more challenging setting where expert actions are not available, and we show that HDT outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in terms of task success rates by a large margin.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICLR ...</summary><p>ICLR 2023.

| **[Guiding Online Reinforcement Learning with Action-Free Offline Pretraining](https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.12876v2)** | 2023-03-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Offline RL methods have been shown to reduce the need for environment interaction by training agents using offline collected episodes. However, these methods typically require action information to be logged during data collection, which can be difficult or even impossible in some practical cases. In this paper, we investigate the potential of using action-free offline datasets to improve online reinforcement learning, name this problem Reinforcement Learning with Action-Free Offline Pretraining (AFP-RL). We introduce Action-Free Guide (AF-Guide), a method that guides online training by extracting knowledge from action-free offline datasets. AF-Guide consists of an Action-Free Decision Transformer (AFDT) implementing a variant of Upside-Down Reinforcement Learning. It learns to plan the next states from the offline dataset, and a Guided Soft Actor-Critic (Guided SAC) that learns online with guidance from AFDT. Experimental results show that AF-Guide can improve sample efficiency and performance in online training thanks to the knowledge from the action-free offline dataset.

| **[User Retention-oriented Recommendation with Decision Transformer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.06347v1)** | 2023-03-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Improving user retention with reinforcement learning~(RL) has attracted increasing attention due to its significant importance in boosting user engagement. However, training the RL policy from scratch without hurting users' experience is unavoidable due to the requirement of trial-and-error searches. Furthermore, the offline methods, which aim to optimize the policy without online interactions, suffer from the notorious stability problem in value estimation or unbounded variance in counterfactual policy evaluation. To this end, we propose optimizing user retention with Decision Transformer~(DT), which avoids the offline difficulty by translating the RL as an autoregressive problem. However, deploying the DT in recommendation is a non-trivial problem because of the following challenges: (1) deficiency in modeling the numerical reward value; (2) data discrepancy between the policy learning and recommendation generation; (3) unreliable offline performance evaluation. In this work, we, therefore, contribute a series of strategies for tackling the exposed issues. We first articulate an efficient reward prompt by weighted aggregation of meta embeddings for informative reward embedding. Then, we endow a weighted contrastive learning method to solve the discrepancy between training and inference. Furthermore, we design two robust offline metrics to measure user retention. Finally, the significant improvement in the benchmark datasets demonstrates the superiority of the proposed method.</p></details> | 9 pages, 5 figures |
| **[Graph Decision Transformer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.03747v1)** | 2023-03-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Offline reinforcement learning (RL) is a challenging task, whose objective is to learn policies from static trajectory data without interacting with the environment. Recently, offline RL has been viewed as a sequence modeling problem, where an agent generates a sequence of subsequent actions based on a set of static transition experiences. However, existing approaches that use transformers to attend to all tokens naively can overlook the dependencies between different tokens and limit long-term dependency learning. In this paper, we propose the Graph Decision Transformer (GDT), a novel offline RL approach that models the input sequence into a causal graph to capture potential dependencies between fundamentally different concepts and facilitate temporal and causal relationship learning. GDT uses a graph transformer to process the graph inputs with relation-enhanced mechanisms, and an optional sequence transformer to handle fine-grained spatial information in visual tasks. Our experiments show that GDT matches or surpasses the performance of state-of-the-art offline RL methods on image-based Atari and OpenAI Gym.</p></details> | 14 pages |
| **[Decision Transformer under Random Frame Dropping](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.03391v1)** | 2023-03-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Controlling agents remotely with deep reinforcement learning~(DRL) in the real world is yet to come. One crucial stepping stone is to devise RL algorithms that are robust in the face of dropped information from corrupted communication or malfunctioning sensors. Typical RL methods usually require considerable online interaction data that are costly and unsafe to collect in the real world. Furthermore, when applying to the frame dropping scenarios, they perform unsatisfactorily even with moderate drop rates. To address these issues, we propose Decision Transformer under Random Frame Dropping~(DeFog), an offline RL algorithm that enables agents to act robustly in frame dropping scenarios without online interaction. DeFog first randomly masks out data in the offline datasets and explicitly adds the time span of frame dropping as inputs. After that, a finetuning stage on the same offline dataset with a higher mask rate would further boost the performance. Empirical results show that DeFog outperforms strong baselines under severe frame drop rates like 90\%, while maintaining similar returns under non-frame-dropping conditions in the regular MuJoCo control benchmarks and the Atari environments. Our approach offers a robust and deployable solution for controlling agents in real-world environments with limited or unreliable data.</p></details> | <details><summary>20 pa...</summary><p>20 pages, 17 figures; accepted to ICLR 2023</p></details> |
| **[Reliable Conditioning of Behavioral Cloning for Offline Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.05158v2)** | 2023-02-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Behavioral cloning (BC) provides a straightforward solution to offline RL by mimicking offline trajectories via supervised learning. Recent advances (Chen et al., 2021; Janner et al., 2021; Emmons et al., 2021) have shown that by conditioning on desired future returns, BC can perform competitively to their value-based counterparts, while enjoying much more simplicity and training stability. While promising, we show that these methods can be unreliable, as their performance may degrade significantly when conditioned on high, out-of-distribution (ood) returns. This is crucial in practice, as we often expect the policy to perform better than the offline dataset by conditioning on an ood value. We show that this unreliability arises from both the suboptimality of training data and model architectures. We propose ConserWeightive Behavioral Cloning (CWBC), a simple and effective method for improving the reliability of conditional BC with two key components: trajectory weighting and conservative regularization. Trajectory weighting upweights the high-return trajectories to reduce the train-test gap for BC methods, while conservative regularizer encourages the policy to stay close to the data distribution for ood conditioning. We study CWBC in the context of RvS (Emmons et al., 2021) and Decision Transformers (Chen et al., 2021), and show that CWBC significantly boosts their performance on various benchmarks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Clinical Decision Transformer: Intended Treatment Recommendation through Goal Prompting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.00612v1)** | 2023-02-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With recent achievements in tasks requiring context awareness, foundation models have been adopted to treat large-scale data from electronic health record (EHR) systems. However, previous clinical recommender systems based on foundation models have a limited purpose of imitating clinicians' behavior and do not directly consider a problem of missing values. In this paper, we propose Clinical Decision Transformer (CDT), a recommender system that generates a sequence of medications to reach a desired range of clinical states given as goal prompts. For this, we conducted goal-conditioned sequencing, which generated a subsequence of treatment history with prepended future goal state, and trained the CDT to model sequential medications required to reach that goal state. For contextual embedding over intra-admission and inter-admissions, we adopted a GPT-based architecture with an admission-wise attention mask and column embedding. In an experiment, we extracted a diabetes dataset from an EHR system, which contained treatment histories of 4788 patients. We observed that the CDT achieved the intended treatment effect according to goal prompt ranges (e.g., NormalA1c, LowerA1c, and HigherA1c), contrary to the case with behavior cloning. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to explore clinical recommendations from the perspective of goal prompting.

| **[Skill Decision Transformer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.13573v1)** | 2023-01-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent work has shown that Large Language Models (LLMs) can be incredibly effective for offline reinforcement learning (RL) by representing the traditional RL problem as a sequence modelling problem (Chen et al., 2021; Janner et al., 2021). However many of these methods only optimize for high returns, and may not extract much information from a diverse dataset of trajectories. Generalized Decision Transformers (GDTs) (Furuta et al., 2021) have shown that utilizing future trajectory information, in the form of information statistics, can help extract more information from offline trajectory data. Building upon this, we propose Skill Decision Transformer (Skill DT). Skill DT draws inspiration from hindsight relabelling (Andrychowicz et al., 2017) and skill discovery methods to discover a diverse set of primitive behaviors, or skills. We show that Skill DT can not only perform offline state-marginal matching (SMM), but can discovery descriptive behaviors that can be easily sampled. Furthermore, we show that through purely reward-free optimization, Skill DT is still competitive with supervised offline RL approaches on the D4RL benchmark.

In most robotic systems, perception is typically independent of motion planning. For example, traditional object detection is passive: it operates only on the images it receives. However, we have a chance to improve the results if we allow planning to consume detection signals and move the robot to collect views that maximize the quality of the results. In this paper, we use reinforcement learning (RL) methods to control the robot in order to obtain images that maximize the detection quality. Specifically, we propose using a Decision Transformer with online fine-tuning, which first optimizes the policy with a pre-collected expert dataset and then improves the learned policy by exploring better solutions in the environment. We evaluate the performance of proposed method on an interactive dataset collected from an indoor scenario simulator. Experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms all baselines, including expert policy and pure offline RL methods.

While it is possible to condition on the entire language instruction directly, such an approach could suffer from generalization issues. In our work, we propose \emph{Learning Interpretable Skill Abstractions (LISA)}, a hierarchical imitation learning framework that can learn diverse, interpretable primitive behaviors or skills from language-conditioned demonstrations to better generalize to unseen instructions. LISA uses vector quantization to learn discrete skill codes that are highly correlated with language instructions and the behavior of the learned policy. In navigation and robotic manipulation environments, LISA outperforms a strong non-hierarchical Decision Transformer baseline in the low data regime and is able to compose learned skills to solve tasks containing unseen long-range instructions. Our method demonstrates a more natural way to condition on language in sequential decision-making problems and achieve interpretable and controllable behavior with the learned skills.</p></details> | <details><summary>NeurI...</summary><p>NeurIPS 2022.

However, simply conditioning a probabilistic model on a desired return and taking the predicted action can fail dramatically in stochastic environments since trajectories that result in a return may have only achieved that return due to luck. In this work, we describe the limitations of RvS approaches in stochastic environments and propose a solution. Rather than simply conditioning on the return of a single trajectory as is standard practice, our proposed method, ESPER, learns to cluster trajectories and conditions on average cluster returns, which are independent from environment stochasticity. Doing so allows ESPER to achieve strong alignment between target return and expected performance in real environments. We demonstrate this in several challenging stochastic offline-RL tasks including the challenging puzzle game 2048, and Connect Four playing against a stochastic opponent. In all tested domains, ESPER achieves significantly better alignment between the target return and achieved return than simply conditioning on returns. ESPER also achieves higher maximum performance than even the value-based baselines.</p></details> | <details><summary>Added...</summary><p>Added experiments with Decision Transformers; Fixed error in Theorem 2.1; Updated related works; Added link for code</p></details> |

In this paper, we analyze how crucial the Transformer model is in the complete DT architecture on continuous control tasks. Namely, we replace the Transformer by an LSTM model while keeping the other parts unchanged to obtain what we call a Decision LSTM model. We compare it to DT on continuous control tasks, including pendulum swing-up and stabilization, in simulation and on physical hardware. Our experiments show that DT struggles with continuous control problems, such as inverted pendulum and Furuta pendulum stabilization. On the other hand, the proposed Decision LSTM is able to achieve expert-level performance on these tasks, in addition to learning a swing-up controller on the real system. These results suggest that the strength of the Decision Transformer for continuous control tasks may lie in the overall sequential modeling architecture and not in the Transformer per se.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 6 figures, Foundation Models for Decision Making Workshop at Neural Information Processing Systems, 2022</p></details> |
| **[Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning is a Sequence Modeling Problem](https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.14953v3)** | 2022-10-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large sequence model (SM) such as GPT series and BERT has displayed outstanding performance and generalization capabilities on vision, language, and recently reinforcement learning tasks. A natural follow-up question is how to abstract multi-agent decision making into an SM problem and benefit from the prosperous development of SMs. In this paper, we introduce a novel architecture named Multi-Agent Transformer (MAT) that effectively casts cooperative multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) into SM problems wherein the task is to map agents' observation sequence to agents' optimal action sequence. Our goal is to build the bridge between MARL and SMs so that the modeling power of modern sequence models can be unleashed for MARL. Central to our MAT is an encoder-decoder architecture which leverages the multi-agent advantage decomposition theorem to transform the joint policy search problem into a sequential decision making process; this renders only linear time complexity for multi-agent problems and, most importantly, endows MAT with monotonic performance improvement guarantee. Unlike prior arts such as Decision Transformer fit only pre-collected offline data, MAT is trained by online trials and errors from the environment in an on-policy fashion. To validate MAT, we conduct extensive experiments on StarCraftII, Multi-Agent MuJoCo, Dexterous Hands Manipulation, and Google Research Football benchmarks. Results demonstrate that MAT achieves superior performance and data efficiency compared to strong baselines including MAPPO and HAPPO. Furthermore, we demonstrate that MAT is an excellent few-short learner on unseen tasks regardless of changes in the number of agents.

| **[Dichotomy of Control: Separating What You Can Control from What You Cannot](https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.13435v1)** | 2022-10-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Future- or return-conditioned supervised learning is an emerging paradigm for offline reinforcement learning (RL), where the future outcome (i.e., return) associated with an observed action sequence is used as input to a policy trained to imitate those same actions. While return-conditioning is at the heart of popular algorithms such as decision transformer (DT), these methods tend to perform poorly in highly stochastic environments, where an occasional high return can arise from randomness in the environment rather than the actions themselves. Such situations can lead to a learned policy that is inconsistent with its conditioning inputs; i.e., using the policy to act in the environment, when conditioning on a specific desired return, leads to a distribution of real returns that is wildly different than desired. In this work, we propose the dichotomy of control (DoC), a future-conditioned supervised learning framework that separates mechanisms within a policy's control (actions) from those beyond a policy's control (environment stochasticity). We achieve this separation by conditioning the policy on a latent variable representation of the future, and designing a mutual information constraint that removes any information from the latent variable associated with randomness in the environment. Theoretically, we show that DoC yields policies that are consistent with their conditioning inputs, ensuring that conditioning a learned policy on a desired high-return future outcome will correctly induce high-return behavior. Empirically, we show that DoC is able to achieve significantly better performance than DT on environments that have highly stochastic rewards and transition</p></details> |  |

In the subfields of vision and language, this was largely achieved by scaling up transformer-based models and training them on large, diverse datasets. Motivated by this progress, we investigate whether the same strategy can be used to produce generalist reinforcement learning agents. Specifically, we show that a single transformer-based model - with a single set of weights - trained purely offline can play a suite of up to 46 Atari games simultaneously at close-to-human performance. When trained and evaluated appropriately, we find that the same trends observed in language and vision hold, including scaling of performance with model size and rapid adaptation to new games via fine-tuning. We compare several approaches in this multi-game setting, such as online and offline RL methods and behavioral cloning, and find that our Multi-Game Decision Transformer models offer the best scalability and performance.

The high-level mechanism guides the low-level controller through the task by selecting sub-goals for the latter to reach. This sequence replaces the returns-to-go of previous methods, improving its performance overall, especially in tasks with longer episodes and scarcer rewards. We validate our method in multiple tasks of OpenAIGym, D4RL and RoboMimic benchmarks. Our method outperforms the baselines in eight out of ten tasks of varied horizons and reward frequencies without prior task knowledge, showing the advantages of the hierarchical model approach for learning from demonstrations using a sequence model.</p></details> |  |
| **[Online Decision Transformer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.05607v2)** | 2022-07-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent work has shown that offline reinforcement learning (RL) can be formulated as a sequence modeling problem (Chen et al., 2021; Janner et al., 2021) and solved via approaches similar to large-scale language modeling. However, any practical instantiation of RL also involves an online component, where policies pretrained on passive offline datasets are finetuned via taskspecific interactions with the environment. We propose Online Decision Transformers (ODT), an RL algorithm based on sequence modeling that blends offline pretraining with online finetuning in a unified framework. Our framework uses sequence-level entropy regularizers in conjunction with autoregressive modeling objectives for sample-efficient exploration and finetuning. Empirically, we show that ODT is competitive with the state-of-the-art in absolute performance on the D4RL benchmark but shows much more significant gains during the finetuning procedure.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ICML 2022 (Long Oral Presentation)</p></details> |
| **[Prompting Decision Transformer for Few-Shot Policy Generalization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.13499v1)** | 2022-06-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Humans can leverage prior experience and learn novel tasks from a handful of demonstrations. In contrast to offline meta-reinforcement learning, which aims to achieve quick adaptation through better algorithm design, we investigate the effect of architecture inductive bias on the few-shot learning capability. We propose a Prompt-based Decision Transformer (Prompt-DT), which leverages the sequential modeling ability of the Transformer architecture and the prompt framework to achieve few-shot adaptation in offline RL. We design the trajectory prompt, which contains segments of the few-shot demonstrations, and encodes task-specific information to guide policy generation. Our experiments in five MuJoCo control benchmarks show that Prompt-DT is a strong few-shot learner without any extra finetuning on unseen target tasks. Prompt-DT outperforms its variants and strong meta offline RL baselines by a large margin with a trajectory prompt containing only a few timesteps. Prompt-DT is also robust to prompt length changes and can generalize to out-of-distribution (OOD) environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICML ...</summary><p>ICML 2022.

| **[Offline Pre-trained Multi-Agent Decision Transformer: One Big Sequence Model Tackles All SMAC Tasks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.02845v3)** | 2022-06-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Offline reinforcement learning leverages previously-collected offline datasets to learn optimal policies with no necessity to access the real environment. Such a paradigm is also desirable for multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) tasks, given the increased interactions among agents and with the enviroment. Yet, in MARL, the paradigm of offline pre-training with online fine-tuning has not been studied, nor datasets or benchmarks for offline MARL research are available. In this paper, we facilitate the research by providing large-scale datasets, and use them to examine the usage of the Decision Transformer in the context of MARL. We investigate the generalisation of MARL offline pre-training in the following three aspects: 1) between single agents and multiple agents, 2) from offline pretraining to the online fine-tuning, and 3) to that of multiple downstream tasks with few-shot and zero-shot capabilities. We start by introducing the first offline MARL dataset with diverse quality levels based on the StarCraftII environment, and then propose the novel architecture of multi-agent decision transformer (MADT) for effective offline learning. MADT leverages transformer's modelling ability of sequence modelling and integrates it seamlessly with both offline and online MARL tasks. A crucial benefit of MADT is that it learns generalisable policies that can transfer between different types of agents under different task scenarios. On StarCraft II offline dataset, MADT outperforms the state-of-the-art offline RL baselines. When applied to online tasks, the pre-trained MADT significantly improves sample efficiency, and enjoys strong performance both few-short and zero-shot cases. To our best knowledge, this is the first work that studies and demonstrates the effectiveness of offline pre-trained models in terms of sample efficiency and generalisability enhancements in MARL.</p></details> | 17 pages, 6 figures |
| **[Generalized Decision Transformer for Offline Hindsight Information Matching](https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.10364v3)** | 2022-02-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>How to extract as much learning signal from each trajectory data has been a key problem in reinforcement learning (RL), where sample inefficiency has posed serious challenges for practical applications. Recent works have shown that using expressive policy function approximators and conditioning on future trajectory information -- such as future states in hindsight experience replay or returns-to-go in Decision Transformer (DT) -- enables efficient learning of multi-task policies, where at times online RL is fully replaced by offline behavioral cloning, e.g. sequence modeling. We demonstrate that all these approaches are doing hindsight information matching (HIM) -- training policies that can output the rest of trajectory that matches some statistics of future state information. We present Generalized Decision Transformer (GDT) for solving any HIM problem, and show how different choices for the feature function and the anti-causal aggregator not only recover DT as a special case, but also lead to novel Categorical DT (CDT) and Bi-directional DT (BDT) for matching different statistics of the future. For evaluating CDT and BDT, we define offline multi-task state-marginal matching (SMM) and imitation learning (IL) as two generic HIM problems, propose a Wasserstein distance loss as a metric for both, and empirically study them on MuJoCo continuous control benchmarks. CDT, which simply replaces anti-causal summation with anti-causal binning in DT, enables the first effective offline multi-task SMM algorithm that generalizes well to unseen and even synthetic multi-modal state-feature distributions. BDT, which uses an anti-causal second transformer as the aggregator, can learn to model any statistics of the future and outperforms DT variants in offline multi-task IL. Our generalized formulations from HIM and GDT greatly expand the role of powerful sequence modeling architectures in modern RL.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ICLR2022, Spotlight.

| **[Transfer learning with causal counterfactual reasoning in Decision Transformers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.14355v1)** | 2021-10-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The ability to adapt to changes in environmental contingencies is an important challenge in reinforcement learning. Indeed, transferring previously acquired knowledge to environments with unseen structural properties can greatly enhance the flexibility and efficiency by which novel optimal policies may be constructed. In this work, we study the problem of transfer learning under changes in the environment dynamics. In this study, we apply causal reasoning in the offline reinforcement learning setting to transfer a learned policy to new environments. Specifically, we use the Decision Transformer (DT) architecture to distill a new policy on the new environment. The DT is trained on data collected by performing policy rollouts on factual and counterfactual simulations from the source environment. We show that this mechanism can bootstrap a successful policy on the target environment while retaining most of the reward.</p></details> |  |
| **[Decision Transformer: Reinforcement Learning via Sequence Modeling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.01345v2)** | 2021-06-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce a framework that abstracts Reinforcement Learning (RL) as a sequence modeling problem. This allows us to draw upon the simplicity and scalability of the Transformer architecture, and associated advances in language modeling such as GPT-x and BERT. In particular, we present Decision Transformer, an architecture that casts the problem of RL as conditional sequence modeling. Unlike prior approaches to RL that fit value functions or compute policy gradients, Decision Transformer simply outputs the optimal actions by leveraging a causally masked Transformer. By conditioning an autoregressive model on the desired return (reward), past states, and actions, our Decision Transformer model can generate future actions that achieve the desired return. Despite its simplicity, Decision Transformer matches or exceeds the performance of state-of-the-art model-free offline RL baselines on Atari, OpenAI Gym, and Key-to-Door tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>First...</summary><p>First two authors contributed equally.

It helps to match a photo to the device that clicked it. In today's scenario, where millions and millions of images are uploaded every hour, it is very easy to compute this unique PRNU pattern from a couple of shared images on social profiles. This endangers the privacy of the camera owner and becomes a cause of major concern for the privacy-aware society. We propose SSS-PRNU scheme that facilitates the forensic investigators to carry out their crime investigation without breaching the privacy of the people. Thus, maintaining a balance between the two. To preserve privacy, extraction of camera fingerprint and PRNU noise for a suspicious image is computed in a trusted execution environment such as ARM TrustZone. After extraction, the sensitive information of camera fingerprint and PRNU noise is distributed into multiple obfuscated shares using Shamir secret sharing(SSS) scheme. These shares are information-theoretically secure and leak no information of underlying content. The encrypted information is distributed to multiple third-part servers where correlation is computed on a share basis between the camera fingerprint and the PRNU noise. These partial correlation values are combined together to obtain the final correlation value that becomes the basis for a match decision. Transforming the computation of the correlation value in the encrypted domain and making it well suited for a distributed environment is the main contribution of the paper. Experiment results validate the feasibility of the proposed scheme that provides a secure framework for PRNU based source camera attribution. The security analysis and evaluation of computational and storage overheads are performed to analysis the practical feasibility of the scheme.</p></details> |  |

Several powerful concepts have emerged to facilitate this vision, whether involving the human context whenever required or directly impacting user behavior and decisions. As these become the stepping stones to develop the IoT into a novel people-centric utility, this paper outlines a path to materialize this decisive transformation.

We continue with a unique system-level performance characterization of a representative urban IoT scenario and quantify the benefits of keeping people in the loop on various levels. Our comprehensive numerical results confirm the significant gains that have been made available with tighter user involvement, and also corroborate the development of efficient incentivization mechanisms, thereby opening the door to future commoditization of the global people-centric IoT utility.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 5 figures.

Cybernetics extracts the full potential of data to serve the spectrum of health care, from acute to chronic problems. Building actionable cybernetic navigation tools can greatly empower optimal health decisions, especially by quantifying lifestyle and environmental data.
