| **[ACoT-VLA: Action Chain-of-Thought for Vision-Language-Action Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11404v1)** | 2026-01-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have emerged as essential generalist robot policies for diverse manipulation tasks, conventionally relying on directly translating multimodal inputs into actions via Vision-Language Model (VLM) embeddings. Recent advancements have introduced explicit intermediary reasoning, such as sub-task prediction (language) or goal image synthesis (vision), to guide action generation. However, these intermediate reasoning are often indirect and inherently limited in their capacity to convey the full, granular information required for precise action execution. Instead, we posit that the most effective form of reasoning is one that deliberates directly in the action space. We introduce Action Chain-of-Thought (ACoT), a paradigm where the reasoning process itself is formulated as a structured sequence of coarse action intents that guide the final policy. In this paper, we propose ACoT-VLA, a novel architecture that materializes the ACoT paradigm. Specifically, we introduce two complementary components: an Explicit Action Reasoner (EAR) and Implicit Action Reasoner (IAR). The former proposes coarse reference trajectories as explicit action-level reasoning steps, while the latter extracts latent action priors from internal representations of multimodal input, co-forming an ACoT that conditions the downstream action head to enable grounded policy learning. Extensive experiments in real-world and simulation environments demonstrate the superiority of our proposed method, which achieves 98.5%, 84.1%, and 47.4% on LIBERO, LIBERO-Plus and VLABench, respectively.</p></details> |  |
| **[VLAgents: A Policy Server for Efficient VLA Inference](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11250v1)** | 2026-01-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid emergence of Vision-Language-Action models (VLAs) has a significant impact on robotics. However, their deployment remains complex due to the fragmented interfaces and the inherent communication latency in distributed setups. To address this, we introduce VLAgents, a modular policy server that abstracts VLA inferencing behind a unified Gymnasium-style protocol. Crucially, its communication layer transparently adapts to the context by supporting both zero-copy shared memory for high-speed simulation and compressed streaming for remote hardware. In this work, we present the architecture of VLAgents and validate it by integrating seven policies -- including OpenVLA and Pi Zero. In a benchmark with both local and remote communication, we further demonstrate how it outperforms the default policy servers provided by OpenVLA, OpenPi, and LeRobot. VLAgents is available at https://github.com/RobotControlStack/vlagents</p></details> |  |
| **[What Can RL Bring to VLA Generalization? An Empirical Study](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19789v4)** | 2026-01-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Vision-Language Action (VLA) models have shown significant potential for embodied AI. However, their predominant training via supervised fine-tuning (SFT) limits generalization due to susceptibility to compounding errors under distribution shifts. Reinforcement learning (RL) offers a path to overcome these limitations by optimizing for task objectives via trial-and-error, yet a systematic understanding of its specific generalization benefits for VLAs compared to SFT is lacking. To address this, our study introduces a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating VLA generalization and systematically investigates the impact of RL fine-tuning across diverse visual, semantic, and execution dimensions. Our extensive experiments reveal that RL fine-tuning, particularly with PPO, significantly enhances generalization in semantic understanding and execution robustness over SFT, while maintaining comparable visual robustness. We identify PPO as a more effective RL algorithm for VLAs than LLM-derived methods like DPO and GRPO. We also develop a simple recipe for efficient PPO training on VLAs, and demonstrate its practical utility for improving VLA generalization.

| **[On-the-Fly VLA Adaptation via Test-Time Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06748v2)** | 2026-01-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-Language-Action models have recently emerged as a powerful paradigm for general-purpose robot learning, enabling agents to map visual observations and natural-language instructions into executable robotic actions. Though popular, they are primarily trained via supervised fine-tuning or training-time reinforcement learning, requiring explicit fine-tuning phases, human interventions, or controlled data collection. Consequently, existing methods remain unsuitable for challenging simulated- or physical-world deployments, where robots must respond autonomously and flexibly to evolving environments. To address this limitation, we introduce a Test-Time Reinforcement Learning for VLAs (TT-VLA), a framework that enables on-the-fly policy adaptation during inference. TT-VLA formulates a dense reward mechanism that leverages step-by-step task-progress signals to refine action policies during test time while preserving the SFT/RL-trained priors, making it an effective supplement to current VLA models. Empirical results show that our approach enhances overall adaptability, stability, and task success in dynamic, previously unseen scenarios under simulated and real-world settings. We believe TT-VLA offers a principled step toward self-improving, deployment-ready VLAs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Dream-VL & Dream-VLA: Open Vision-Language and Vision-Language-Action Models with Diffusion Language Model Backbone](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22615v2)** | 2026-01-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While autoregressive Large Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have achieved remarkable success, their sequential generation often limits their efficacy in complex visual planning and dynamic robotic control. In this work, we investigate the potential of constructing Vision-Language Models upon diffusion-based large language models (dLLMs) to overcome these limitations. We introduce Dream-VL, an open diffusion-based VLM (dVLM) that achieves state-of-the-art performance among previous dVLMs. Dream-VL is comparable to top-tier AR-based VLMs trained on open data on various benchmarks but exhibits superior potential when applied to visual planning tasks. Building upon Dream-VL, we introduce Dream-VLA, a dLLM-based Vision-Language-Action model (dVLA) developed through continuous pre-training on open robotic datasets. We demonstrate that the natively bidirectional nature of this diffusion backbone serves as a superior foundation for VLA tasks, inherently suited for action chunking and parallel generation, leading to significantly faster convergence in downstream fine-tuning. Dream-VLA achieves top-tier performance of 97.2% average success rate on LIBERO, 71.4% overall average on SimplerEnv-Bridge, and 60.5% overall average on SimplerEnv-Fractal, surpassing leading models such as $π_0$ and GR00T-N1. We also validate that dVLMs surpass AR baselines on downstream tasks across different training objectives. We release both Dream-VL and Dream-VLA to facilitate further research in the community.</p></details> | <details><summary>Add r...</summary><p>Add real-world experiments</p></details> |
| **[VLA-RAIL: A Real-Time Asynchronous Inference Linker for VLA Models and Robots](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24673v1)** | 2025-12-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have achieved remarkable breakthroughs in robotics, with the action chunk playing a dominant role in these advances. Given the real-time and continuous nature of robotic motion control, the strategies for fusing a queue of successive action chunks have a profound impact on the overall performance of VLA models. Existing methods suffer from jitter, stalling, or even pauses in robotic action execution, which not only limits the achievable execution speed but also reduces the overall success rate of task completion. This paper introduces VLA-RAIL (A Real-Time Asynchronous Inference Linker), a novel framework designed to address these issues by conducting model inference and robot motion control asynchronously and guaranteeing smooth, continuous, and high-speed action execution. The core contributions of the paper are two fold: a Trajectory Smoother that effectively filters out the noise and jitter in the trajectory of one action chunk using polynomial fitting and a Chunk Fuser that seamlessly align the current executing trajectory and the newly arrived chunk, ensuring position, velocity, and acceleration continuity between two successive action chunks. We validate the effectiveness of VLA-RAIL on a benchmark of dynamic simulation tasks and several real-world manipulation tasks. Experimental results demonstrate that VLA-RAIL significantly reduces motion jitter, enhances execution speed, and improves task success rates, which will become a key infrastructure for the large-scale deployment of VLA models.</p></details> |  |
| **[Counterfactual VLA: Self-Reflective Vision-Language-Action Model with Adaptive Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24426v1)** | 2025-12-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent reasoning-augmented Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have improved the interpretability of end-to-end autonomous driving by generating intermediate reasoning traces. Yet these models primarily describe what they perceive and intend to do, rarely questioning whether their planned actions are safe or appropriate. This work introduces Counterfactual VLA (CF-VLA), a self-reflective VLA framework that enables the model to reason about and revise its planned actions before execution. CF-VLA first generates time-segmented meta-actions that summarize driving intent, and then performs counterfactual reasoning conditioned on both the meta-actions and the visual context. This step simulates potential outcomes, identifies unsafe behaviors, and outputs corrected meta-actions that guide the final trajectory generation. To efficiently obtain such self-reflective capabilities, we propose a rollout-filter-label pipeline that mines high-value scenes from a base (non-counterfactual) VLA's rollouts and labels counterfactual reasoning traces for subsequent training rounds. Experiments on large-scale driving datasets show that CF-VLA improves trajectory accuracy by up to 17.6%, enhances safety metrics by 20.5%, and exhibits adaptive thinking: it only enables counterfactual reasoning in challenging scenarios. By transforming reasoning traces from one-shot descriptions to causal self-correction signals, CF-VLA takes a step toward self-reflective autonomous driving agents that learn to think before they act.</p></details> |  |
| **[VLA-Arena: An Open-Source Framework for Benchmarking Vision-Language-Action Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22539v1)** | 2025-12-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While Vision-Language-Action models (VLAs) are rapidly advancing towards generalist robot policies, it remains difficult to quantitatively understand their limits and failure modes. To address this, we introduce a comprehensive benchmark called VLA-Arena. We propose a novel structured task design framework to quantify difficulty across three orthogonal axes: (1) Task Structure, (2) Language Command, and (3) Visual Observation. This allows us to systematically design tasks with fine-grained difficulty levels, enabling a precise measurement of model capability frontiers. For Task Structure, VLA-Arena's 170 tasks are grouped into four dimensions: Safety, Distractor, Extrapolation, and Long Horizon. Each task is designed with three difficulty levels (L0-L2), with fine-tuning performed exclusively on L0 to assess general capability. Orthogonal to this, language (W0-W4) and visual (V0-V4) perturbations can be applied to any task to enable a decoupled analysis of robustness. Our extensive evaluation of state-of-the-art VLAs reveals several critical limitations, including a strong tendency toward memorization over generalization, asymmetric robustness, a lack of consideration for safety constraints, and an inability to compose learned skills for long-horizon tasks. To foster research addressing these challenges and ensure reproducibility, we provide the complete VLA-Arena framework, including an end-to-end toolchain from task definition to automated evaluation and the VLA-Arena-S/M/L datasets for fine-tuning. Our benchmark, data, models, and leaderboard are available at https://vla-arena.github.io.</p></details> |  |
| **[STARE-VLA: Progressive Stage-Aware Reinforcement for Fine-Tuning Vision-Language-Action Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05107v2)** | 2025-12-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models, powered by large language models and reinforcement learning-based fine-tuning, have shown remarkable progress in robotic manipulation. Existing methods often treat long-horizon actions as linguistic sequences and apply trajectory-level optimization methods such as Trajectory-wise Preference Optimization (TPO) or Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), leading to coarse credit assignment and unstable training. However, unlike language, where a unified semantic meaning is preserved despite flexible sentence order, action trajectories progress through causally chained stages with different learning difficulties. This motivates progressive stage optimization. Thereby, we present Stage-Aware Reinforcement (STARE), a module that decomposes a long-horizon action trajectory into semantically meaningful stages and provides dense, interpretable, and stage-aligned reinforcement signals. Integrating STARE into TPO and PPO, we yield Stage-Aware TPO (STA-TPO) and Stage-Aware PPO (STA-PPO) for offline stage-wise preference and online intra-stage interaction, respectively. Further building on supervised fine-tuning as initialization, we propose the Imitation -> Preference -> Interaction (IPI), a serial fine-tuning pipeline for improving action accuracy in VLA models. Experiments on SimplerEnv and ManiSkill3 demonstrate substantial gains, achieving state-of-the-art success rates of 98.0 percent on SimplerEnv and 96.4 percent on ManiSkill3 tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Discrete Diffusion VLA: Bringing Discrete Diffusion to Action Decoding in Vision-Language-Action Policies](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20072v3)** | 2025-12-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models adapt large vision-language backbones to map images and instructions into robot actions. However, prevailing VLAs either generate actions auto-regressively in a fixed left-to-right order or attach separate MLP or diffusion heads outside the backbone, leading to fragmented information pathways and specialized training requirements that hinder a unified, scalable architecture. We present Discrete Diffusion VLA, a unified-transformer policy that models discretized action chunks with discrete diffusion. The design retains diffusion's progressive refinement paradigm while remaining natively compatible with the discrete token interface of VLMs. Our method achieves an adaptive decoding order that resolves easy action elements before harder ones and uses secondary re-masking to revisit uncertain predictions across refinement rounds, which improves consistency and enables robust error correction. This unified decoder preserves pre-trained vision-language priors, supports parallel decoding, breaks the autoregressive bottleneck, and reduces the number of function evaluations. Discrete Diffusion VLA achieves 96.3% avg. success rates on LIBERO, 71.2% visual matching on SimplerEnv-Fractal and 54.2% overall on SimplerEnv-Bridge. We also provide ablation study on vision-language ability retention on LIBERO-OOD (Out-of-Distribution) benchmark, with our method improving over autoregressive, MLP decoder and continuous diffusion baselines. These findings indicate that discrete-diffusion VLA supports precise action modeling and consistent training, laying groundwork for scaling VLA to larger models and datasets. Our code is available at https://github.com/Liang-ZX/DiscreteDiffusionVLA/tree/libero.</p></details> | <details><summary>New e...</summary><p>New experiments on VL retention and new ablations. 18 pages</p></details> |
| **[Open-Source Multimodal Moxin Models with Moxin-VLM and Moxin-VLA](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22208v1)** | 2025-12-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have undergone a significant transformation, marked by a rapid rise in both their popularity and capabilities. Leading this evolution are proprietary LLMs like GPT-4 and GPT-o1, which have captured widespread attention in the AI community due to their remarkable performance and versatility. Simultaneously, open-source LLMs, such as LLaMA and Mistral, have made great contributions to the ever-increasing popularity of LLMs due to the ease to customize and deploy the models across diverse applications. Moxin 7B is introduced as a fully open-source LLM developed in accordance with the Model Openness Framework, which moves beyond the simple sharing of model weights to embrace complete transparency in training, datasets, and implementation detail, thus fostering a more inclusive and collaborative research environment that can sustain a healthy open-source ecosystem. To further equip Moxin with various capabilities in different tasks, we develop three variants based on Moxin, including Moxin-VLM, Moxin-VLA, and Moxin-Chinese, which target the vision-language, vision-language-action, and Chinese capabilities, respectively. Experiments show that our models achieve superior performance in various evaluations. We adopt open-source framework and open data for the training. We release our models, along with the available data and code to derive these models.</p></details> |  |
| **[QDepth-VLA: Quantized Depth Prediction as Auxiliary Supervision for Vision-Language-Action Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14836v2)** | 2025-12-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatial perception and reasoning are crucial for Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models to accomplish fine-grained manipulation tasks. However, existing approaches often lack the ability to understand and reason over the essential 3D structures necessary for precise control. To address this limitation, we propose QDepth-VLA, a general framework that augments VLA models with an auxiliary depth prediction task. A dedicated depth expert is designed to predict quantized latent tokens of depth maps obtained from a VQ-VAE encoder, enabling the model to learn depth-aware representations that capture critical geometric cues. Experimental results on the simulation benchmarks and real-world tasks demonstrate that QDepth-VLA yields strong spatial reasoning and competitive performance on manipulation tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[cVLA: Towards Efficient Camera-Space VLAs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02190v2)** | 2025-12-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models offer a compelling framework for tackling complex robotic manipulation tasks, but they are often expensive to train. In this paper, we propose a novel VLA approach that leverages the competitive performance of Vision Language Models (VLMs) on 2D images to directly infer robot end-effector poses in image frame coordinates. Unlike prior VLA models that output low-level controls, our model predicts trajectory waypoints, making it both more efficient to train and robot embodiment agnostic. Despite its lightweight design, our next-token prediction architecture effectively learns meaningful and executable robot trajectories. We further explore the underutilized potential of incorporating depth images, inference-time techniques such as decoding strategies, and demonstration-conditioned action generation. Our model is trained on a simulated dataset and exhibits strong sim-to-real transfer capabilities. We evaluate our approach using a combination of simulated and real data, demonstrating its effectiveness on a real robotic system.</p></details> | <details><summary>20 pa...</summary><p>20 pages, 10 figures; CoRL 2025 Workshop on Generalizable Priors for Robot Manipulation</p></details> |
| **[Robotic VLA Benefits from Joint Learning with Motion Image Diffusion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18007v1)** | 2025-12-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have achieved remarkable progress in robotic manipulation by mapping multimodal observations and instructions directly to actions. However, they typically mimic expert trajectories without predictive motion reasoning, which limits their ability to reason about what actions to take. To address this limitation, we propose joint learning with motion image diffusion, a novel strategy that enhances VLA models with motion reasoning capabilities. Our method extends the VLA architecture with a dual-head design: while the action head predicts action chunks as in vanilla VLAs, an additional motion head, implemented as a Diffusion Transformer (DiT), predicts optical-flow-based motion images that capture future dynamics. The two heads are trained jointly, enabling the shared VLM backbone to learn representations that couple robot control with motion knowledge. This joint learning builds temporally coherent and physically grounded representations without modifying the inference pathway of standard VLAs, thereby maintaining test-time latency. Experiments in both simulation and real-world environments demonstrate that joint learning with motion image diffusion improves the success rate of pi-series VLAs to 97.5% on the LIBERO benchmark and 58.0% on the RoboTwin benchmark, yielding a 23% improvement in real-world performance and validating its effectiveness in enhancing the motion reasoning capability of large-scale VLAs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Websi...</summary><p>Website: https://vla-motion.github.io/</p></details> |
| **[mimic-video: Video-Action Models for Generalizable Robot Control Beyond VLAs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15692v2)** | 2025-12-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Prevailing Vision-Language-Action Models (VLAs) for robotic manipulation are built upon vision-language backbones pretrained on large-scale, but disconnected static web data. As a result, despite improved semantic generalization, the policy must implicitly infer complex physical dynamics and temporal dependencies solely from robot trajectories. This reliance creates an unsustainable data burden, necessitating continuous, large-scale expert data collection to compensate for the lack of innate physical understanding. We contend that while vision-language pretraining effectively captures semantic priors, it remains blind to physical causality. A more effective paradigm leverages video to jointly capture semantics and visual dynamics during pretraining, thereby isolating the remaining task of low-level control. To this end, we introduce mimic-video, a novel Video-Action Model (VAM) that pairs a pretrained Internet-scale video model with a flow matching-based action decoder conditioned on its latent representations. The decoder serves as an Inverse Dynamics Model (IDM), generating low-level robot actions from the latent representation of video-space action plans. Our extensive evaluation shows that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on simulated and real-world robotic manipulation tasks, improving sample efficiency by 10x and convergence speed by 2x compared to traditional VLA architectures.</p></details> | <details><summary>Revis...</summary><p>Revised Introduction, Related Work, and Appendix.

| **[VLA-AN: An Efficient and Onboard Vision-Language-Action Framework for Aerial Navigation in Complex Environments](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15258v2)** | 2025-12-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper proposes VLA-AN, an efficient and onboard Vision-Language-Action (VLA) framework dedicated to autonomous drone navigation in complex environments. VLA-AN addresses four major limitations of existing large aerial navigation models: the data domain gap, insufficient temporal navigation with reasoning, safety issues with generative action policies, and onboard deployment constraints. First, we construct a high-fidelity dataset utilizing 3D Gaussian Splatting (3D-GS) to effectively bridge the domain gap. Second, we introduce a progressive three-stage training framework that sequentially reinforces scene comprehension, core flight skills, and complex navigation capabilities. Third, we design a lightweight, real-time action module coupled with geometric safety correction. This module ensures fast, collision-free, and stable command generation, mitigating the safety risks inherent in stochastic generative policies. Finally, through deep optimization of the onboard deployment pipeline, VLA-AN achieves a robust real-time 8.3x improvement in inference throughput on resource-constrained UAVs. Extensive experiments demonstrate that VLA-AN significantly improves spatial grounding, scene reasoning, and long-horizon navigation, achieving a maximum single-task success rate of 98.1%, and providing an efficient, practical solution for realizing full-chain closed-loop autonomy in lightweight aerial robots.</p></details> |  |
| **[Phantom Menace: Exploring and Enhancing the Robustness of VLA Models Against Physical Sensor Attacks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10008v2)** | 2025-12-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models revolutionize robotic systems by enabling end-to-end perception-to-action pipelines that integrate multiple sensory modalities, such as visual signals processed by cameras and auditory signals captured by microphones. This multi-modality integration allows VLA models to interpret complex, real-world environments using diverse sensor data streams. Given the fact that VLA-based systems heavily rely on the sensory input, the security of VLA models against physical-world sensor attacks remains critically underexplored. To address this gap, we present the first systematic study of physical sensor attacks against VLAs, quantifying the influence of sensor attacks and investigating the defenses for VLA models. We introduce a novel "Real-Sim-Real" framework that automatically simulates physics-based sensor attack vectors, including six attacks targeting cameras and two targeting microphones, and validates them on real robotic systems. Through large-scale evaluations across various VLA architectures and tasks under varying attack parameters, we demonstrate significant vulnerabilities, with susceptibility patterns that reveal critical dependencies on task types and model designs. We further develop an adversarial-training-based defense that enhances VLA robustness against out-of-distribution physical perturbations caused by sensor attacks while preserving model performance. Our findings expose an urgent need for standardized robustness benchmarks and mitigation strategies to secure VLA deployments in safety-critical environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by AAAI 2026 main track</p></details> |
| **[GeoPredict: Leveraging Predictive Kinematics and 3D Gaussian Geometry for Precise VLA Manipulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16811v1)** | 2025-12-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models achieve strong generalization in robotic manipulation but remain largely reactive and 2D-centric, making them unreliable in tasks that require precise 3D reasoning. We propose GeoPredict, a geometry-aware VLA framework that augments a continuous-action policy with predictive kinematic and geometric priors. GeoPredict introduces a trajectory-level module that encodes motion history and predicts multi-step 3D keypoint trajectories of robot arms, and a predictive 3D Gaussian geometry module that forecasts workspace geometry with track-guided refinement along future keypoint trajectories. These predictive modules serve exclusively as training-time supervision through depth-based rendering, while inference requires only lightweight additional query tokens without invoking any 3D decoding. Experiments on RoboCasa Human-50, LIBERO, and real-world manipulation tasks show that GeoPredict consistently outperforms strong VLA baselines, especially in geometry-intensive and spatially demanding scenarios.</p></details> |  |
| **[EVOLVE-VLA: Test-Time Training from Environment Feedback for Vision-Language-Action Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14666v1)** | 2025-12-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Achieving truly adaptive embodied intelligence requires agents that learn not just by imitating static demonstrations, but by continuously improving through environmental interaction, which is akin to how humans master skills through practice. Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have advanced robotic manipulation by leveraging large language models, yet remain fundamentally limited by Supervised Finetuning (SFT): requiring hundreds of demonstrations per task, rigidly memorizing trajectories, and failing to adapt when deployment conditions deviate from training. We introduce EVOLVE-VLA, a test-time training framework enabling VLAs to continuously adapt through environment interaction with minimal or zero task-specific demonstrations. The key technical challenge is replacing oracle reward signals (unavailable at test time) with autonomous feedback. We address this through a learned progress estimator providing dense feedback, and critically, we design our framework to ``tame'' this inherently noisy signal via two mechanisms: (1) an accumulative progress estimation mechanism smoothing noisy point-wise estimates, and (2) a progressive horizon extension strategy enabling gradual policy evolution. EVOLVE-VLA achieves substantial gains: +8.6\% on long-horizon tasks, +22.0\% in 1-shot learning, and enables cross-task generalization -- achieving 20.8\% success on unseen tasks without task-specific demonstrations training (vs. 0\% for pure SFT). Qualitative analysis reveals emergent capabilities absent in demonstrations, including error recovery and novel strategies. This work represents a critical step toward VLAs that truly learn and adapt, moving beyond static imitation toward continuous self-improvements.</p></details> | 15 pages |
| **[Sample-Efficient Robot Skill Learning for Construction Tasks: Benchmarking Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning and Vision-Language-Action VLA Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14031v1)** | 2025-12-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This study evaluates two leading approaches for teaching construction robots new skills to understand their applicability for construction automation: a Vision-Language-Action (VLA) model and Reinforcement Learning (RL) methods. The goal is to understand both task performance and the practical effort needed to deploy each approach on real jobs. The authors developed two teleoperation interfaces to control the robots and collect the demonstrations needed, both of which proved effective for training robots for long-horizon and dexterous tasks. In addition, the authors conduct a three-stage evaluation. First, the authors compare a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) policy with a Deep Q-network (DQN) imitation model to identify the stronger RL baseline, focusing on model performance, generalization, and a pick-up experiment. Second, three different VLA models are trained in two different scenarios and compared with each other. Third, the authors benchmark the selected RL baseline against the VLA model using computational and sample-efficiency measures and then a robot experiment on a multi-stage panel installation task that includes transport and installation. The VLA model demonstrates strong generalization and few-shot capability, achieving 60% and 100% success in the pickup phase. In comparison, DQN can be made robust but needs additional noise during tuning, which increases the workload. Overall, the findings indicate that VLA offers practical advantages for changing tasks by reducing programming effort and enabling useful performance with minimal data, while DQN provides a viable baseline when sufficient tuning effort is acceptable.</p></details> |  |
| **[Spatial-Aware VLA Pretraining through Visual-Physical Alignment from Human Videos](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13080v1)** | 2025-12-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models provide a promising paradigm for robot learning by integrating visual perception with language-guided policy learning. However, most existing approaches rely on 2D visual inputs to perform actions in 3D physical environments, creating a significant gap between perception and action grounding. To bridge this gap, we propose a Spatial-Aware VLA Pretraining paradigm that performs explicit alignment between visual space and physical space during pretraining, enabling models to acquire 3D spatial understanding before robot policy learning. Starting from pretrained vision-language models, we leverage large-scale human demonstration videos to extract 3D visual and 3D action annotations, forming a new source of supervision that aligns 2D visual observations with 3D spatial reasoning. We instantiate this paradigm with VIPA-VLA, a dual-encoder architecture that incorporates a 3D visual encoder to augment semantic visual representations with 3D-aware features. When adapted to downstream robot tasks, VIPA-VLA achieves significantly improved grounding between 2D vision and 3D action, resulting in more robust and generalizable robotic policies.</p></details> |  |
| **[WholeBodyVLA: Towards Unified Latent VLA for Whole-Body Loco-Manipulation Control](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11047v2)** | 2025-12-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Humanoid robots require precise locomotion and dexterous manipulation to perform challenging loco-manipulation tasks. Yet existing approaches, modular or end-to-end, are deficient in manipulation-aware locomotion. This confines the robot to a limited workspace, preventing it from performing large-space loco-manipulation. We attribute this to: (1) the challenge of acquiring loco-manipulation knowledge due to the scarcity of humanoid teleoperation data, and (2) the difficulty of faithfully and reliably executing locomotion commands, stemming from the limited precision and stability of existing RL controllers. To acquire richer loco-manipulation knowledge, we propose a unified latent learning framework that enables Vision-Language-Action (VLA) system to learn from low-cost action-free egocentric videos. Moreover, an efficient human data collection pipeline is devised to augment the dataset and scale the benefits. To execute the desired locomotion commands more precisely, we present a loco-manipulation-oriented (LMO) RL policy specifically tailored for accurate and stable core loco-manipulation movements, such as advancing, turning, and squatting. Building on these components, we introduce WholeBodyVLA, a unified framework for humanoid loco-manipulation. To the best of our knowledge, WholeBodyVLA is one of its kind enabling large-space humanoid loco-manipulation. It is verified via comprehensive experiments on the AgiBot X2 humanoid, outperforming prior baseline by 21.3%.

While Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models show potential in learning skills from demonstrations, their scalability is limited by scarce high-quality training data. Existing data collection methods face inherent constraints: manual teleoperation overloads human operators, while automated planning often produces unnatural motions. We propose a Shared Autonomy framework that divides control between macro and micro motions. A human operator guides the robot's arm pose through intuitive VR teleoperation, while an autonomous DexGrasp-VLA policy handles fine-grained hand control using real-time tactile and visual feedback. This division significantly reduces cognitive load and enables efficient collection of high-quality coordinated arm-hand demonstrations. Using this data, we train an end-to-end VLA policy enhanced with our novel Arm-Hand Feature Enhancement module, which captures both distinct and shared representations of macro and micro movements for more natural coordination. Our Corrective Teleoperation system enables continuous policy improvement through human-in-the-loop failure recovery. Experiments demonstrate that our framework generates high-quality data with minimal manpower and achieves a 90% success rate across diverse objects, including unseen instances. Comprehensive evaluations validate the system's effectiveness in developing dexterous manipulation capabilities.</p></details> |  |

We introduce Atomic Action Slicing (AAS), a planner-aligned approach that decomposes long-horizon demonstrations into short, typed atomic actions that are easier for planners to use and policies to learn. Using LIBERO demonstrations, AAS produces a validated dataset of 2,124 atomic segments labeled with action type, temporal span, and confidence. A stronger segmenter (Gemini 2.5 Pro) closely matches planner-defined plans and remains robust under keyframe jitter, while smaller models perform worse on multi-object tasks. Fine-tuning CLIP-RT+ on our atomic dataset improves task success from 94.2% to 95.3% on LIBERO-Goal and 83.8% to 88.8% on LIBERO-Long. We publicly release the GATE-VLAP dataset on HuggingFace(https://huggingface.co/datasets/gate-institute/GATE-VLAP-datasets)</p></details> | <details><summary>The 4...</summary><p>The 41st ACM/SIGAPP Symposium On Applied Computing</p></details> |

This paper presents an efficient fine-tuning methodology and real-world deployment analysis for adapting VLA models to low-cost robotic manipulation systems.We propose a resource-efficient fine-tuning strategy using Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) and quantization techniques that enable multi-billion parameter VLA models ( 3.1B parameters) to run on consumer-grade GPUs with 8GB VRAM. Our methodology addresses the critical challenge of adapting pre-trained VLA models to new robot embodiments with limited demonstration data, focusing on the trade-offs between frozen and unfrozen vision encoders. Through real-world deployment on the SO101 robotic arm for a button-pressing manipulation task, we demonstrate that our approach achieves effective manipulation performance while maintaining computational efficiency. We provide detailed analysis of deployment challenges, failure modes, and the relationship between training data quantity and real-world performance,trained on 200 demonstration episodes. Our results show that with proper fine-tuning methodology, VLA models can be successfully deployed on affordable robotic platforms,making advanced manipulation capabilities accessible beyond expensive research robots.</p></details> |  |

However, most VLAs assume the Markov property, relying only on the current observation and thus suffering from temporal myopia that degrades long-horizon coherence. In this work, we view motion as a more compact and informative representation of temporal context and world dynamics, capturing inter-state changes while filtering static pixel-level noise. Building on this idea, we propose HiF-VLA (Hindsight, Insight, and Foresight for VLAs), a unified framework that leverages motion for bidirectional temporal reasoning. HiF-VLA encodes past dynamics through hindsight priors, anticipates future motion via foresight reasoning, and integrates both through a hindsight-modulated joint expert to enable a ''think-while-acting'' paradigm for long-horizon manipulation. As a result, HiF-VLA surpasses strong baselines on LIBERO-Long and CALVIN ABC-D benchmarks, while incurring negligible additional inference latency. Furthermore, HiF-VLA achieves substantial improvements in real-world long-horizon manipulation tasks, demonstrating its broad effectiveness in practical robotic settings.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://hifvla.github.io Github: https://github.com/OpenHelix-Team/HiF-VLA</p></details> |
| **[PosA-VLA: Enhancing Action Generation via Pose-Conditioned Anchor Attention](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03724v2)** | 2025-12-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have demonstrated remarkable performance on embodied tasks and shown promising potential for real-world applications. However, current VLAs still struggle to produce consistent and precise target-oriented actions, as they often generate redundant or unstable motions along trajectories, limiting their applicability in time-sensitive scenarios.In this work, we attribute these redundant actions to the spatially uniform perception field of existing VLAs, which causes them to be distracted by target-irrelevant objects, especially in complex environments.To address this issue, we propose an efficient PosA-VLA framework that anchors visual attention via pose-conditioned supervision, consistently guiding the model's perception toward task-relevant regions. The pose-conditioned anchor attention mechanism enables the model to better align instruction semantics with actionable visual cues, thereby improving action generation precision and efficiency. Moreover, our framework adopts a lightweight architecture and requires no auxiliary perception modules (e.g., segmentation or grounding networks), ensuring efficient inference. Extensive experiments verify that our method executes embodied tasks with precise and time-efficient behavior across diverse robotic manipulation benchmarks and shows robust generalization in a variety of challenging environments.</p></details> |  |
| **[Affordance Field Intervention: Enabling VLAs to Escape Memory Traps in Robotic Manipulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07472v1)** | 2025-12-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have shown great performance in robotic manipulation by mapping visual observations and language instructions directly to actions. However, they remain brittle under distribution shifts: when test scenarios change, VLAs often reproduce memorized trajectories instead of adapting to the updated scene, which is a failure mode we refer to as the "Memory Trap". This limitation stems from the end-to-end design, which lacks explicit 3D spatial reasoning and prevents reliable identification of actionable regions in unfamiliar environments. To compensate for this missing spatial understanding, 3D Spatial Affordance Fields (SAFs) can provide a geometric representation that highlights where interactions are physically feasible, offering explicit cues about regions the robot should approach or avoid. We therefore introduce Affordance Field Intervention (AFI), a lightweight hybrid framework that uses SAFs as an on-demand plug-in to guide VLA behavior. Our system detects memory traps through proprioception, repositions the robot to recent high-affordance regions, and proposes affordance-driven waypoints that anchor VLA-generated actions. A SAF-based scorer then selects trajectories with the highest cumulative affordance. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves an average improvement of 23.5% across different VLA backbones ($π_{0}$ and $π_{0.5}$) under out-of-distribution scenarios on real-world robotic platforms, and 20.2% on the LIBERO-Pro benchmark, validating its effectiveness in enhancing VLA robustness to distribution shifts.</p></details> |  |
| **[WAM-Diff: A Masked Diffusion VLA Framework with MoE and Online Reinforcement Learning for Autonomous Driving](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11872v1)** | 2025-12-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>End-to-end autonomous driving systems based on vision-language-action (VLA) models integrate multimodal sensor inputs and language instructions to generate planning and control signals. While autoregressive large language models and continuous diffusion policies are prevalent, the potential of discrete masked diffusion for trajectory generation remains largely unexplored. This paper presents WAM-Diff, a VLA framework that employs masked diffusion to iteratively refine a discrete sequence representing future ego-trajectories. Our approach features three key innovations: a systematic adaptation of masked diffusion for autonomous driving that supports flexible, non-causal decoding orders; scalable model capacity via a sparse MoE architecture trained jointly on motion prediction and driving-oriented visual question answering (VQA); and online reinforcement learning using Group Sequence Policy Optimization (GSPO) to optimize sequence-level driving rewards. Remarkably, our model achieves 91.0 PDMS on NAVSIM-v1 and 89.7 EPDMS on NAVSIM-v2, demonstrating the effectiveness of masked diffusion for autonomous driving. The approach provides a promising alternative to autoregressive and diffusion-based policies, supporting scenario-aware decoding strategies for trajectory generation.

| **[HiMoE-VLA: Hierarchical Mixture-of-Experts for Generalist Vision-Language-Action Policies](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05693v1)** | 2025-12-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The development of foundation models for embodied intelligence critically depends on access to large-scale, high-quality robot demonstration data. Recent approaches have sought to address this challenge by training on large collections of heterogeneous robotic datasets. However, unlike vision or language data, robotic demonstrations exhibit substantial heterogeneity across embodiments and action spaces as well as other prominent variations such as senor configurations and action control frequencies. The lack of explicit designs for handling such heterogeneity causes existing methods to struggle with integrating diverse factors, thereby limiting their generalization and leading to degraded performance when transferred to new settings. In this paper, we present HiMoE-VLA, a novel vision-language-action (VLA) framework tailored to effectively handle diverse robotic data with heterogeneity. Specifically, we introduce a Hierarchical Mixture-of-Experts (HiMoE) architecture for the action module which adaptively handles multiple sources of heterogeneity across layers and gradually abstracts them into shared knowledge representations. Through extensive experimentation with simulation benchmarks and real-world robotic platforms, HiMoE-VLA demonstrates a consistent performance boost over existing VLA baselines, achieving higher accuracy and robust generalization across diverse robots and action spaces.

| **[FPC-VLA: A Vision-Language-Action Framework with a Supervisor for Failure Prediction and Correction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04018v2)** | 2025-12-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Robotic manipulation is a fundamental component of automation. However, traditional perception-planning pipelines often fall short in open-ended tasks due to limited flexibility, while the architecture of a single end-to-end Vision-Language-Action (VLA) offers promising capabilities but lacks crucial mechanisms for anticipating and recovering from failure. To address these challenges, we propose FPC-VLA, a dual-model framework that integrates VLA with a supervisor for failure prediction and correction. The supervisor evaluates action viability through vision-language queries and generates corrective strategies when risks arise, trained efficiently without manual labeling. A dual-stream fusion module further refines actions by leveraging past predictions. Evaluation results on multiple simulation platforms (SIMPLER and LIBERO) and robot embodiments (WidowX, Google Robot, Franka) show that FPC-VLA outperforms state-of-the-art models in both zero-shot and fine-tuned settings. Successful real-world deployments on diverse, long-horizon tasks confirm FPC-VLA's strong generalization and practical utility for building more reliable autonomous systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[VLA Models Are More Generalizable Than You Think: Revisiting Physical and Spatial Modeling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02902v1)** | 2025-12-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-language-action (VLA) models achieve strong in-distribution performance but degrade sharply under novel camera viewpoints and visual perturbations. We show that this brittleness primarily arises from misalignment in Spatial Modeling, rather than Physical Modeling. To address this, we propose a one-shot adaptation framework that recalibrates visual representations through lightweight, learnable updates. Our first method, Feature Token Modulation (FTM), applies a global affine transformation to visual tokens and improves Libero viewpoint accuracy from 48.5% to 87.1% with only 4K parameters. Building on this, Feature Linear Adaptation (FLA) introduces low-rank updates to the ViT encoder, achieving 90.8% success with 4.7M parameters -- matching LoRA-scale finetuning at far lower cost. Together, these results reveal substantial untapped robustness in pretrained VLA models and demonstrate that targeted, minimal visual adaptation is sufficient to restore viewpoint generalization.</p></details> |  |
| **[AVA-VLA: Improving Vision-Language-Action models with Active Visual Attention](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18960v2)** | 2025-12-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in embodied AI tasks. However, existing VLA models, often built upon Vision-Language Models (VLMs), typically process dense visual inputs independently at each timestep. This approach implicitly models the task as a Markov Decision Process (MDP). However, this history-agnostic design is suboptimal for effective visual token processing in dynamic sequential decision-making, as it fails to leverage the context of history. To address this limitation, we reformulate the problem from a Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP) perspective and propose a novel framework named AVA-VLA. Inspired by the POMDP that the action generation should be conditioned on the belief state. AVA-VLA introduces Active Visual Attention (AVA) to dynamically modulate visual processing. It achieves this by leveraging the recurrent state, which is a neural approximation of the agent's belief state derived from the previous decision step. Specifically, the AVA module uses the recurrent state to compute the soft weights to actively process task-relevant visual tokens based on its historical context. Comprehensive evaluations demonstrate that AVA-VLA achieves state-of-the-art performance across popular robotic benchmarks, including LIBERO and CALVIN. Furthermore, real-world deployments on a dual-arm robot platform validate the framework's practical applicability and robust sim-to-real transferability.</p></details> | 18 pages, 10 figures |
| **[ManualVLA: A Unified VLA Model for Chain-of-Thought Manual Generation and Robotic Manipulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02013v1)** | 2025-12-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have recently emerged, demonstrating strong generalization in robotic scene understanding and manipulation. However, when confronted with long-horizon tasks that require defined goal states, such as LEGO assembly or object rearrangement, existing VLA models still face challenges in coordinating high-level planning with precise manipulation. Therefore, we aim to endow a VLA model with the capability to infer the "how" process from the "what" outcomes, transforming goal states into executable procedures. In this paper, we introduce ManualVLA, a unified VLA framework built upon a Mixture-of-Transformers (MoT) architecture, enabling coherent collaboration between multimodal manual generation and action execution. Unlike prior VLA models that directly map sensory inputs to actions, we first equip ManualVLA with a planning expert that generates intermediate manuals consisting of images, position prompts, and textual instructions. Building upon these multimodal manuals, we design a Manual Chain-of-Thought (ManualCoT) reasoning process that feeds them into the action expert, where each manual step provides explicit control conditions, while its latent representation offers implicit guidance for accurate manipulation. To alleviate the burden of data collection, we develop a high-fidelity digital-twin toolkit based on 3D Gaussian Splatting, which automatically generates manual data for planning expert training. ManualVLA demonstrates strong real-world performance, achieving an average success rate 32% higher than the previous hierarchical SOTA baseline on LEGO assembly and object rearrangement tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[DiG-Flow: Discrepancy-Guided Flow Matching for Robust VLA Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01715v1)** | 2025-12-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models trained with flow matching have demonstrated impressive capabilities on robotic manipulation tasks. However, their performance often degrades under distribution shift and on complex multi-step tasks, suggesting that the learned representations may not robustly capture task-relevant semantics. We introduce DiG-Flow, a principled framework that enhances VLA robustness through geometric regularization. Our key insight is that the distributional discrepancy between observation and action embeddings provides a meaningful geometric signal: lower transport cost indicates compatible representations, while higher cost suggests potential misalignment. DiG-Flow computes a discrepancy measure between empirical distributions of observation and action embeddings, maps it to a modulation weight via a monotone function, and applies residual updates to the observation embeddings before flow matching. Crucially, this intervention operates at the representation level without modifying the flow matching path or target vector field. We provide theoretical guarantees showing that discrepancy-guided training provably decreases the training objective, and that guided inference refinement converges with contraction. Empirically, DiG-Flow integrates into existing VLA architectures with negligible overhead and consistently improves performance, with particularly pronounced gains on complex multi-step tasks and under limited training data.</p></details> |  |

However, the interpretability and coherence of the decision process and the plausibility of action sequences remain largely underexplored. To address these issues, we propose AutoDrive-R$^2$, a novel VLA framework that enhances both reasoning and self-reflection capabilities of autonomous driving systems through chain-of-thought (CoT) processing and reinforcement learning (RL). Specifically, we first propose an innovative CoT dataset named nuScenesR$^2$-6K for supervised fine-tuning, which effectively builds cognitive bridges between input information and output trajectories through a four-step logical chain with self-reflection for validation. Moreover, to maximize both reasoning and self-reflection during the RL stage, we further employ the Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) algorithm within a physics-grounded reward framework that incorporates spatial alignment, vehicle dynamic, and temporal smoothness criteria to ensure reliable and realistic trajectory planning. Extensive evaluation results across both nuScenes and Waymo datasets demonstrates the state-of-the-art performance and robust generalization capacity of our proposed method.</p></details> |  |
| **[VLASH: Real-Time VLAs via Future-State-Aware Asynchronous Inference](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01031v1)** | 2025-11-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-Language-Action models (VLAs) are becoming increasingly capable across diverse robotic tasks. However, their real-world deployment remains slow and inefficient: demonstration videos are often sped up by 5-10x to appear smooth, with noticeable action stalls and delayed reactions to environmental changes. Asynchronous inference offers a promising solution to achieve continuous and low-latency control by enabling robots to execute actions and perform inference simultaneously. However, because the robot and environment continue to evolve during inference, a temporal misalignment arises between the prediction and execution intervals. This leads to significant action instability, while existing methods either degrade accuracy or introduce runtime overhead to mitigate it. We propose VLASH, a general asynchronous inference framework for VLAs that delivers smooth, accurate, and fast reaction control without additional overhead or architectural changes. VLASH estimates the future execution-time state by rolling the robot state forward with the previously generated action chunk, thereby bridging the gap between prediction and execution. Experiments show that VLASH achieves up to 2.03x speedup and reduces reaction latency by up to 17.4x compared to synchronous inference while fully preserving the original accuracy. Moreover, it empowers VLAs to handle fast-reaction, high-precision tasks such as playing ping-pong and playing whack-a-mole, where traditional synchronous inference fails.

To mitigate this issue, using a lightweight VLM has been explored, but it compromises spatiotemporal reasoning. Although some methods suggest that incorporating additional 3D inputs can help, they usually rely on large VLMs to fuse 3D and 2D inputs and still lack temporal understanding. Therefore, we propose SwiftVLA, an architecture that enhances a compact model with 4D understanding while preserving design efficiency. Specifically, our approach features a pretrained 4D visual geometry transformer with a temporal cache that extracts 4D features from 2D images. Then, to enhance the VLM's ability to exploit both 2D images and 4D features, we introduce Fusion Tokens, a set of learnable tokens trained with a future prediction objective to generate unified representations for action generation. Finally, we introduce a mask-and-reconstruct strategy that masks 4D inputs to the VLM and trains the VLA to reconstruct them, enabling the VLM to learn effective 4D representations and allowing the 4D branch to be dropped at inference with minimal performance loss. Experiments in real and simulated environments show that SwiftVLA outperforms lightweight baselines and rivals VLAs up to 7 times larger, achieving comparable performance on edge devices while being 18 times faster and reducing memory footprint by 12 times.</p></details> |  |

Among existing approaches, a majority of current VLA systems employ parallel two finger grippers as their default end effectors. However, such grippers face inherent limitations in handling certain real world tasks such as wiping glass surfaces or opening drawers without handles due to insufficient contact area or lack of adhesion. To overcome these challenges, we present a low cost, integrated hardware design that combines a mechanical two finger gripper with a vacuum suction unit, enabling dual mode manipulation within a single end effector. Our system supports flexible switching or synergistic use of both modalities, expanding the range of feasible tasks. We validate the efficiency and practicality of our design within two state of the art VLA frameworks: DexVLA and Pi0. Experimental results demonstrate that with the proposed hybrid end effector, robots can successfully perform multiple complex tasks that are infeasible for conventional two finger grippers alone. All hardware designs and controlling systems will be released.</p></details> | 8 pages |

Yet existing VLA models still struggle to generalize across diverse tasks, scenes, and camera viewpoints, and often produce coarse or unstable actions. We introduce E0, a continuized discrete diffusion framework that formulates action generation as iterative denoising over quantized action tokens. Compared with continuous diffusion policies, E0 offers two key advantages: (1) discrete action tokens align naturally with the symbolic structure of pretrained VLM/VLA backbones, enabling stronger semantic conditioning; and 2. discrete diffusion matches the true quantized nature of real-world robot control-whose hardware constraints (e.g., encoder resolution, control frequency, actuation latency) inherently discretize continuous signals-and therefore benefits from a Bayes-optimal denoiser that models the correct discrete action distribution, leading to stronger generalization. Compared with discrete autoregressive and mask-based discrete diffusion models, E0 supports a significantly larger and finer-grained action vocabulary and avoids the distributional mismatch introduced by masking-based corruptions-yielding more accurate fine-grained action control. We further introduce a spherical viewpoint perturbation augmentation method to improve robustness to camera shifts without additional data. Experiments on LIBERO, VLABench, and ManiSkill show that E0 achieves state-of-the-art performance across 14 diverse environments, outperforming strong baselines by 10.7% on average. Real-world evaluation on a Franka arm confirms that E0 delivers precise, robust, and transferable manipulation, establishing discrete diffusion as a promising direction for generalizable VLA policy learning.</p></details> |  |

Our method first trains a lightweight motion tokenizer to encode motion dynamics, then employs an unsupervised action segmenter leveraging a novel "Latent Action Energy" metric to discover and segment semantically coherent action primitives. The pipeline outputs both segmented video clips and their corresponding latent action sequences, providing structured data directly suitable for VLA pre-training. Evaluations on public benchmarks and a proprietary electric motor assembly dataset demonstrate effective segmentation of key tasks performed by humans at workstations. Further clustering and quantitative assessment via a Vision-Language Model confirm the semantic coherence of the discovered action primitives. To our knowledge, this is the first fully automated end-to-end system for extracting and organizing VLA pre-training data from unstructured industrial videos, offering a scalable solution for embodied AI integration in manufacturing.</p></details> | 10 pages, 5 figures |

Recent approaches have shifted from focusing solely on common scenarios to addressing complex, long-tail situations such as subtle human behaviors, traffic accidents, and non-compliant driving patterns. Given the demonstrated capabilities of large language models (LLMs) in understanding visual and natural language inputs and following instructions, recent methods have integrated LLMs into autonomous driving systems to enhance reasoning, interpretability, and performance across diverse scenarios. However, existing methods typically rely either on real-world data, which is suitable for industrial deployment, or on simulation data tailored to rare or hard case scenarios. Few approaches effectively integrate the complementary advantages of both data sources. To address this limitation, we propose a novel VLM-guided, end-to-end adversarial transfer framework for autonomous driving that transfers long-tail handling capabilities from simulation to real-world deployment, named CoC-VLA. The framework comprises a teacher VLM model, a student VLM model, and a discriminator. Both the teacher and student VLM models utilize a shared base architecture, termed the Chain-of-Causality Visual-Language Model (CoC VLM), which integrates temporal information via an end-to-end text adapter. This architecture supports chain-of-thought reasoning to infer complex driving logic. The teacher and student VLM models are pre-trained separately on simulated and real-world datasets. The discriminator is trained adversarially to facilitate the transfer of long-tail handling capabilities from simulated to real-world environments by the student VLM model, using a novel backpropagation strategy.</p></details> |  |

However, existing VLAs often struggle with achieving efficient inference and generalizing to novel autonomous vehicle configurations and driving scenarios. In this paper, we propose Reasoning-VLA, a general and fast action-generation VLA framework. The proposed model employs a set of learnable action queries, initialized via Gaussian sampling from ground-truth trajectories within the training corpus. These learnable queries interact with reasoning-enhanced vision-language features to generate continuous action trajectories in parallel. To promote robust generalization, we consolidate eight publicly available autonomous driving datasets into a standardized, Chain-of-Thought reasoning-based, and easy-to-use data format for model training. Leveraging both supervised learning and reinforcement learning fine-tuning, extensive empirical evaluations across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that Reasoning-VLA achieves state-of-the-art performance, superior generalization capability, and the excellent inference speed reported to date.</p></details> |  |
| **[Compressor-VLA: Instruction-Guided Visual Token Compression for Efficient Robotic Manipulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18950v1)** | 2025-11-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have emerged as a powerful paradigm in Embodied AI. However, the significant computational overhead of processing redundant visual tokens remains a critical bottleneck for real-time robotic deployment. While standard token pruning techniques can alleviate this, these task-agnostic methods struggle to preserve task-critical visual information. To address this challenge, simultaneously preserving both the holistic context and fine-grained details for precise action, we propose Compressor-VLA, a novel hybrid instruction-conditioned token compression framework designed for efficient, task-oriented compression of visual information in VLA models. The proposed Compressor-VLA framework consists of two token compression modules: a Semantic Task Compressor (STC) that distills holistic, task-relevant context, and a Spatial Refinement Compressor (SRC) that preserves fine-grained spatial details. This compression is dynamically modulated by the natural language instruction, allowing for the adaptive condensation of task-relevant visual information. Experimentally, extensive evaluations demonstrate that Compressor-VLA achieves a competitive success rate on the LIBERO benchmark while reducing FLOPs by 59% and the visual token count by over 3x compared to its baseline. The real-robot deployments on a dual-arm robot platform validate the model's sim-to-real transferability and practical applicability. Moreover, qualitative analyses reveal that our instruction guidance dynamically steers the model's perceptual focus toward task-relevant objects, thereby validating the effectiveness of our approach.</p></details> | 11 pages, 5 figures |

Recent methods have focused on scaling backbone architectures to improve generalization, with less emphasis on addressing inference inefficiencies essential for real-time use. In this work, we present KV-Efficient VLA, a model-agnostic memory compression approach designed to address these limitations by introducing a lightweight mechanism to selectively retain high-utility context. Our method partitions the KV cache into fixed-size chunks and employs a recurrent gating module to summarize and filter the historical context according to learned utility scores. This design aims to preserve recent fine-grained detail while aggressively pruning stale, low-relevance memory. Based on experiments, our approach can yield an average of 24.6% FLOPs savings, 1.34x inference speedup, and 1.87x reduction in KV memory. Our method integrates seamlessly into recent VLA stacks, enabling scalable inference without modifying downstream control logic.</p></details> |  |
| **[VLA-4D: Embedding 4D Awareness into Vision-Language-Action Models for SpatioTemporally Coherent Robotic Manipulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17199v1)** | 2025-11-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-language-action (VLA) models show potential for general robotic tasks, but remain challenging in spatiotemporally coherent manipulation, which requires fine-grained representations. Typically, existing methods embed 3D positions into visual representations to enhance the spatial precision of actions. However, these methods struggle to achieve temporally coherent control over action execution. In this work, we propose VLA-4D, a general VLA model with 4D awareness for spatiotemporally coherent robotic manipulation. Our model is guided by two key designs: 1) 4D-aware visual representation. We extract visual features, embed 1D time into 3D positions for 4D embeddings, and fuse them into a unified visual representation via a cross-attention mechanism. 2) Spatiotemporal action representation. We extend conventional spatial action representations with temporal information to enable the spatiotemporal planning, and align the multimodal representations into the LLM for spatiotemporal action prediction. Within this unified framework, the designed visual and action representations jointly make robotic manipulation spatially-smooth and temporally-coherent. In addition, we extend the VLA dataset with temporal action annotations for fine-tuning our model. Extensive experiments have been conducted to verify the superiority of our method across different tasks of robotic manipulation.</p></details> |  |

Token pruning (keeping salient visual tokens and dropping redundant ones) has emerged as an effective approach for accelerating Vision-Language Models (VLMs), offering a solution for efficient VLA. However, these VLM-specific token pruning methods select tokens based solely on semantic salience metrics (e.g., prefill attention), while overlooking the VLA's intrinsic dual-system nature of high-level semantic understanding and low-level action execution. Consequently, these methods bias token retention toward semantic cues, discard critical information for action generation, and significantly degrade VLA performance. To bridge this gap, we propose VLA-Pruner, a versatile plug-and-play VLA-specific token prune method that aligns with the dual-system nature of VLA models and exploits the temporal continuity in robot manipulation. Specifically, VLA-Pruner adopts a dual-level importance criterion for visual token retention: vision-language prefill attention for semantic-level relevance and action decode attention, estimated via temporal smoothing, for action-level importance. Based on this criterion, VLA-Pruner proposes a novel dual-level token selection strategy that adaptively preserves a compact, informative set of visual tokens for both semantic understanding and action execution under given compute budget. Experiments show that VLA-Pruner achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple VLA architectures and diverse robotic tasks.</p></details> |  |

Existing model-centric optimization paths, such as model compression (which often leads to performance degradation) or policy distillation (whose products are model-dependent and lack generality), fail to fundamentally address this data-level challenge. To this end, this paper introduces FT-NCFM, a fundamentally different, data-centric generative data distillation framework. Our framework employs a self-contained Fact-Tracing (FT) engine that combines causal attribution with programmatic contrastive verification to assess the intrinsic value of samples. Guided by these assessments, an adversarial NCFM process synthesizes a model-agnostic, information-dense, and reusable data asset. Experimental results on several mainstream VLA benchmarks show that models trained on just 5% of our distilled coreset achieve a success rate of 85-90% compared with training on the full dataset, while reducing training time by over 80%. Our work demonstrates that intelligent data distillation is a highly promising new path for building efficient, high-performance VLA models.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at the AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence (AAAI-26)</p></details> |

We present a general-purpose method, RL with Experience and Corrections via Advantage-conditioned Policies (RECAP), that provides for RL training of VLAs via advantage conditioning. Our method incorporates heterogeneous data into the self-improvement process, including demonstrations, data from on-policy collection, and expert teleoperated interventions provided during autonomous execution. RECAP starts by pre-training a generalist VLA with offline RL, which we call $π^{*}_{0.6}$, that can then be specialized to attain high performance on downstream tasks through on-robot data collection. We show that the $π^{*}_{0.6}$ model trained with the full RECAP method can fold laundry in real homes, reliably assemble boxes, and make espresso drinks using a professional espresso machine. On some of the hardest tasks, RECAP more than doubles task throughput and roughly halves the task failure rate.</p></details> |  |

We address the challenge of mapping natural language instructions and one or more RGBD observations to quasi-static robot actions. 3D-aware robot policies achieve state-of-the-art performance on precise robot manipulation tasks, but struggle with generalization to unseen instructions, scenes, and objects. On the other hand, VLAs excel at generalizing across instructions and scenes, but can be sensitive to camera and robot pose variations. We leverage prior knowledge embedded in language and vision foundation models to improve generalization of 3D-aware keyframe policies. OG-VLA unprojects input observations from diverse views into a point cloud which is then rendered from canonical orthographic views, ensuring input view invariance and consistency between input and output spaces. These canonical views are processed with a vision backbone, a Large Language Model (LLM), and an image diffusion model to generate images that encode the next position and orientation of the end-effector on the input scene. Evaluations on the Arnold and Colosseum benchmarks demonstrate state-of-the-art generalization to unseen environments, with over 40% relative improvements while maintaining robust performance in seen settings. We also show real-world adaption in 3 to 5 demonstrations along with strong generalization. Videos and resources at https://og-vla.github.io/</p></details> | 13 pages |

Existing methods typically model the dataset's action distribution using simple observations as inputs. However, these inputs are often incomplete, resulting in a dispersed conditional action distribution-an issue we refer to as coordinate system chaos and state chaos. This inconsistency significantly hampers pretraining efficiency. To address this, we propose 4D-VLA, a novel approach that effectively integrates 4D information into the input to mitigate these sources of chaos. Our model introduces depth and temporal information into visual features with sequential RGB-D inputs, aligning the coordinate systems of the robot and the scene. This alignment endows the model with strong spatiotemporal reasoning capabilities while minimizing training overhead. Additionally, we introduce memory bank sampling, a frame sampling strategy designed to extract informative frames from historical images, further improving effectiveness and efficiency. Experimental results demonstrate that our pretraining method and architectural components substantially enhance model performance. In both simulated and real-world experiments, our model achieves a significant increase in success rate over OpenVLA. To further assess spatial perception and generalization to novel views, we introduce MV-Bench, a multi-view simulation benchmark. Our model consistently outperforms existing methods, demonstrating stronger spatial understanding and adaptability.</p></details> |  |

However, pre-trained VLA policies still suffer from substantial performance degradation during downstream deployment. Although fine-tuning can mitigate this issue, its reliance on costly demonstration collection and intensive computation makes it impractical in real-world settings. In this work, we introduce VLA-Pilot, a plug-and-play inference-time policy steering method for zero-shot deployment of pre-trained VLA without any additional fine-tuning or data collection. We evaluate VLA-Pilot on six real-world downstream manipulation tasks across two distinct robotic embodiments, encompassing both in-distribution and out-of-distribution scenarios. Experimental results demonstrate that VLA-Pilot substantially boosts the success rates of off-the-shelf pre-trained VLA policies, enabling robust zero-shot generalization to diverse tasks and embodiments.

In particular, end-to-end autonomous driving in unstructured outdoor environments often encounters conditions that were unfamiliar during training. In this work, we present Vision-Language Action Retrieval (VLA-R), an open-world end-to-end autonomous driving (OW-E2EAD) framework that integrates open-world perception with a novel vision-action retrieval paradigm. We leverage a frozen vision-language model for open-world detection and segmentation to obtain multi-scale, prompt-guided, and interpretable perception features without domain-specific tuning. A Q-Former bottleneck aggregates fine-grained visual representations with language-aligned visual features, bridging perception and action domains. To learn transferable driving behaviors, we introduce a vision-action contrastive learning scheme that aligns vision-language and action embeddings for effective open-world reasoning and action retrieval. Our experiments on a real-world robotic platform demonstrate strong generalization and exploratory performance in unstructured, unseen environments, even with limited data. Demo videos are provided in the supplementary material.</p></details> | 9 pages, 9 figures |

This frame-by-frame processing makes models vulnerable to visual noise while ignoring the substantial coherence between consecutive frames in manipulation sequences. We propose Temporal Token Fusion (TTF), a training-free approach that intelligently integrates historical and current visual representations to enhance VLA inference quality. Our method employs dual-dimension detection combining efficient grayscale pixel difference analysis with attention-based semantic relevance assessment, enabling selective temporal token fusion through hard fusion strategies and keyframe anchoring to prevent error accumulation. Comprehensive experiments across LIBERO, SimplerEnv, and real robot tasks demonstrate consistent improvements: 4.0 percentage points average on LIBERO (72.4\% vs 68.4\% baseline), cross-environment validation on SimplerEnv (4.8\% relative improvement), and 8.7\% relative improvement on real robot tasks. Our approach proves model-agnostic, working across OpenVLA and VLA-Cache architectures. Notably, TTF reveals that selective Query matrix reuse in attention mechanisms enhances rather than compromises performance, suggesting promising directions for direct KQV matrix reuse strategies that achieve computational acceleration while improving task success rates.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to AAAI 2026.

However, vision-only VLA models create fundamental limitations, particularly in perceiving interactive and manipulation dynamic processes. This paper proposes Audio-VLA, a multimodal manipulation policy that leverages contact audio to perceive contact events and dynamic process feedback. Audio-VLA overcomes the vision-only constraints of VLA models. Additionally, this paper introduces the Task Completion Rate (TCR) metric to systematically evaluate dynamic operational processes. Audio-VLA employs pre-trained DINOv2 and SigLIP as visual encoders, AudioCLIP as the audio encoder, and Llama2 as the large language model backbone. We apply LoRA fine-tuning to these pre-trained modules to achieve robust cross-modal understanding of both visual and acoustic inputs. A multimodal projection layer aligns features from different modalities into the same feature space. Moreover RLBench and LIBERO simulation environments are enhanced by adding collision-based audio generation to provide realistic sound feedback during object interactions. Since current robotic manipulation evaluations focus on final outcomes rather than providing systematic assessment of dynamic operational processes, the proposed TCR metric measures how well robots perceive dynamic processes during manipulation, creating a more comprehensive evaluation metric. Extensive experiments on LIBERO, RLBench, and two real-world tasks demonstrate Audio-VLA's superior performance over vision-only comparative methods, while the TCR metric effectively quantifies dynamic process perception capabilities.</p></details> |  |
| **[MAP-VLA: Memory-Augmented Prompting for Vision-Language-Action Model in Robotic Manipulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09516v1)** | 2025-11-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Pre-trained Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have achieved remarkable success in improving robustness and generalization for end-to-end robotic manipulation. However, these models struggle with long-horizon tasks due to their lack of memory and reliance solely on immediate sensory inputs. To address this limitation, we propose Memory-Augmented Prompting for Vision-Language-Action model (MAP-VLA), a novel framework that empowers pre-trained VLA models with demonstration-derived memory prompts to augment action generation for long-horizon robotic manipulation tasks. To achieve this, MAP-VLA first constructs a memory library from historical demonstrations, where each memory unit captures information about a specific stage of a task. These memory units are implemented as learnable soft prompts optimized through prompt tuning. Then, during real-time task execution, MAP-VLA retrieves relevant memory through trajectory similarity matching and dynamically integrates it into the VLA model for augmented action generation. Importantly, this prompt tuning and retrieval augmentation approach operates as a plug-and-play module for a frozen VLA model, offering a lightweight and flexible solution to improve task performance. Experimental results show that MAP-VLA delivers up to 7.0% absolute performance gains in the simulation benchmark and 25.0% on real robot evaluations for long-horizon tasks, surpassing the current state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> |  |

This survey delves into advanced VLA methods, aiming to provide a clear taxonomy and a systematic, comprehensive review of existing research. It presents a comprehensive analysis of VLA applications across different scenarios and classifies VLA approaches into several paradigms: autoregression-based, diffusion-based, reinforcement-based, hybrid, and specialized methods; while examining their motivations, core strategies, and implementations in detail. In addition, foundational datasets, benchmarks, and simulation platforms are introduced. Building on the current VLA landscape, the review further proposes perspectives on key challenges and future directions to advance research in VLA models and generalizable robotics. By synthesizing insights from over three hundred recent studies, this survey maps the contours of this rapidly evolving field and highlights the opportunities and challenges that will shape the development of scalable, general-purpose VLA methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[How Do VLAs Effectively Inherit from VLMs?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06619v1)** | 2025-11-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-language-action (VLA) models hold the promise to attain generalizable embodied control. To achieve this, a pervasive paradigm is to leverage the rich vision-semantic priors of large vision-language models (VLMs). However, the fundamental question persists: How do VLAs effectively inherit the prior knowledge from VLMs? To address this critical question, we introduce a diagnostic benchmark, GrinningFace, an emoji tabletop manipulation task where the robot arm is asked to place objects onto printed emojis corresponding to language instructions. This task design is particularly revealing -- knowledge associated with emojis is ubiquitous in Internet-scale datasets used for VLM pre-training, yet emojis themselves are largely absent from standard robotics datasets. Consequently, they provide a clean proxy: successful task completion indicates effective transfer of VLM priors to embodied control. We implement this diagnostic task in both simulated environment and a real robot, and compare various promising techniques for knowledge transfer. Specifically, we investigate the effects of parameter-efficient fine-tuning, VLM freezing, co-training, predicting discretized actions, and predicting latent actions. Through systematic evaluation, our work not only demonstrates the critical importance of preserving VLM priors for the generalization of VLA but also establishes guidelines for future research in developing truly generalizable embodied AI systems.</p></details> |  |

In many real-world applications, consistent high performance on a limited set of tasks is more important than broad generalization. We propose ExpReS-VLA, a method for specializing pre-trained VLA models through experience replay and retrieval while preventing catastrophic forgetting. ExpReS-VLA stores compact feature representations from the frozen vision backbone instead of raw image-action pairs, reducing memory usage by approximately 97 percent. During deployment, relevant past experiences are retrieved using cosine similarity and used to guide adaptation, while prioritized experience replay emphasizes successful trajectories. We also introduce Thresholded Hybrid Contrastive Loss, which enables learning from both successful and failed attempts. On the LIBERO simulation benchmark, ExpReS-VLA improves success rates from 82.6 to 93.1 percent on spatial reasoning tasks and from 61 to 72.3 percent on long-horizon tasks. On physical robot experiments with five manipulation tasks, it reaches 98 percent success on both seen and unseen settings, compared to 84.7 and 32 percent for naive fine-tuning. Adaptation takes 31 seconds using 12 demonstrations on a single RTX 5090 GPU, making the approach practical for real robot deployment.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 5 figures, submitted to ICRA 2026.

We introduce GeoAware-VLA, a simple yet effective approach that enhances viewpoint invariance by integrating strong geometric priors into the vision backbone. Instead of training a visual encoder or relying on explicit 3D data, we leverage a frozen, pretrained geometric vision model as a feature extractor. A trainable projection layer then adapts these geometrically-rich features for the policy decoder, relieving it of the burden of learning 3D consistency from scratch. Through extensive evaluations on LIBERO benchmark subsets, we show GeoAware-VLA achieves substantial improvements in zero-shot generalization to novel camera poses, boosting success rates by over 2x in simulation. Crucially, these benefits translate to the physical world; our model shows a significant performance gain on a real robot, especially when evaluated from unseen camera angles. Our approach proves effective across both continuous and discrete action spaces, highlighting that robust geometric grounding is a key component for creating more generalizable robotic agents.</p></details> | <details><summary>Under...</summary><p>Under Review, Project Page https://alisharey.github.io/GeoAware-VLA/</p></details> |

Existing solutions often apply end-to-end imitation learning with Vision-Language Action (VLA) models or symbolic approaches with Action Model Learning (AML). On the one hand, current VLA models are limited by the lack of high-level symbolic planning, which hinders their abilities in long-horizon tasks. On the other hand, symbolic approaches in AML lack generalization and scalability perspectives. In this paper we present a new neuro-symbolic approach, GraSP-VLA, a framework that uses a Continuous Scene Graph representation to generate a symbolic representation of human demonstrations. This representation is used to generate new planning domains during inference and serves as an orchestrator for low-level VLA policies, scaling up the number of actions that can be reproduced in a row. Our results show that GraSP-VLA is effective for modeling symbolic representations on the task of automatic planning domain generation from observations. In addition, results on real-world experiments show the potential of our Continuous Scene Graph representation to orchestrate low-level VLA policies in long-horizon tasks.</p></details> |  |

However, most existing models rely solely on RGB cameras, limiting their perception and, consequently, manipulation capabilities. We present OmniVLA, an omni-modality VLA model that integrates novel sensing modalities for physically-grounded spatial intelligence beyond RGB perception. The core of our approach is the sensor-masked image, a unified representation that overlays spatially grounded and physically meaningful masks onto the RGB images, derived from sensors including an infrared camera, a mmWave radar, and a microphone array. This image-native unification keeps sensor input close to RGB statistics to facilitate training, provides a uniform interface across sensor hardware, and enables data-efficient learning with lightweight per-sensor projectors. Built on this, we present a multisensory vision-language-action model architecture and train the model based on an RGB-pretrained VLA backbone. We evaluate OmniVLA on challenging real-world tasks where sensor-modality perception guides the robotic manipulation. OmniVLA achieves an average task success rate of 84%, significantly outperforms both RGB-only and raw-sensor-input baseline models by 59% and 28% respectively, meanwhile showing higher learning efficiency and stronger generalization capability.</p></details> |  |
| **[Unified Diffusion VLA: Vision-Language-Action Model via Joint Discrete Denoising Diffusion Process](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01718v1)** | 2025-11-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-language-action (VLA) models aim to understand natural language instructions and visual observations and to execute corresponding actions as an embodied agent. Recent work integrates future images into the understanding-acting loop, yielding unified VLAs that jointly understand, generate, and act -- reading text and images and producing future images and actions. However, these models either rely on external experts for modality unification or treat image generation and action prediction as separate processes, limiting the benefits of direct synergy between these tasks. Our core philosophy is to optimize generation and action jointly through a synchronous denoising process, where the iterative refinement enables actions to evolve from initialization, under constant and sufficient visual guidance. We ground this philosophy in our proposed Unified Diffusion VLA and Joint Discrete Denoising Diffusion Process (JD3P), which is a joint diffusion process that integrates multiple modalities into a single denoising trajectory to serve as the key mechanism enabling understanding, generation, and acting to be intrinsically synergistic. Our model and theory are built on a unified tokenized space of all modalities and a hybrid attention mechanism. We further propose a two-stage training pipeline and several inference-time techniques that optimize performance and efficiency. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on benchmarks such as CALVIN, LIBERO, and SimplerEnv with 4$\times$ faster inference than autoregressive methods, and we demonstrate its effectiveness through in-depth analysis and real-world evaluations.

The main contributions are listed as follows: (1) a latent action model thoroughly trained on large-scale human and robotic manipulation videos; (2) a dual-level action representation framework that jointly supervises both the Vision-Language Model (VLM) and the action expert during training; (3) a mixed training strategy that combines robot trajectory data with general QA and spatial QA datasets, effectively enhancing the 3D perceptual and reasoning capabilities of the VLM backbone. Specifically, the VLM is trained to predict two complementary forms of actions: latent actions, derived from our latent action model pretrained on cross-embodiment manipulation data, which capture implicit high-level intentions; and structured discrete action tokens, obtained through frequency-domain transformations of continuous control signals, which encode explicit low-level dynamics. This dual supervision aligns the representation spaces of language, vision, and action, enabling the VLM to directly contribute to action generation. Experimental results on the LIBERO Franka benchmark demonstrate the superiority of our frame-work, while real-world evaluations further show that iFlyBot-VLA achieves competitive success rates across diverse and challenging manipulation tasks. Furthermore, we plan to open-source a portion of our self-constructed dataset to support future research in the community</p></details> |  |
| **[World-Env: Leveraging World Model as a Virtual Environment for VLA Post-Training](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24948v3)** | 2025-11-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models trained via imitation learning suffer from significant performance degradation in data-scarce scenarios due to their reliance on large-scale demonstration datasets. Although reinforcement learning (RL)-based post-training has proven effective in addressing data scarcity, its application to VLA models is hindered by the non-resettable nature of real-world environments. This limitation is particularly critical in high-risk domains such as industrial automation, where interactions often induce state changes that are costly or infeasible to revert. Furthermore, existing VLA approaches lack a reliable mechanism for detecting task completion, leading to redundant actions that reduce overall task success rates. To address these challenges, we propose World-Env, an RL-based post-training framework that replaces physical interaction with a low-cost, world model-based virtual simulator. World-Env consists of two key components: (1) a video-based world simulator that generates temporally consistent future visual observations, and (2) a vision-language model (VLM)-guided instant reflector that provides continuous reward signals and predicts action termination. This simulated environment enables VLA models to safely explore and generalize beyond their initial imitation learning distribution. Our method achieves notable performance gains with as few as five expert demonstrations per task. Experiments on complex robotic manipulation tasks demonstrate that World-Env effectively overcomes the data inefficiency, safety constraints, and inefficient execution of conventional VLA models that rely on real-world interaction, offering a practical and scalable solution for post-training in resource-constrained settings. Our code is available at https://github.com/amap-cvlab/world-env.</p></details> |  |

Yet when these VLMs are adapted to the action modality, it remains unclear to what extent their original VL representations and knowledge are preserved. In this work, we conduct a systematic study of representation retention during VLA fine-tuning, showing that naive action fine-tuning leads to degradation of visual representations. To characterize and measure these effects, we probe VLA's hidden representations and analyze attention maps, further, we design a set of targeted tasks and methods that contrast VLA models with their counterpart VLMs, isolating changes in VL capabilities induced by action fine-tuning. We further evaluate a range of strategies for aligning visual representations and introduce a simple yet effective method that mitigates degradation and yields improved generalization to out-of-distribution (OOD) scenarios. Taken together, our analysis clarifies the trade-off between action fine-tuning and the degradation of VL representations and highlights practical approaches to recover inherited VL capabilities.

Yet, when trained via imitation learning, their high generative capacity makes them sensitive to noise in human demonstrations: jerks, pauses, and jitter which reduce action coherence. Reduced action coherence causes instability and trajectory drift during deployment, failures that are catastrophic in fine-grained manipulation where precision is crucial.

However, their substantial computational cost poses a challenge for real-time robotic control, where rapid decision-making is essential. This paper introduces VLA-Cache, a training-free inference acceleration method that reduces computational overhead by adaptively caching and reusing static visual tokens across frames. Exploiting the temporal continuity in robotic manipulation, VLA-Cache identifies minimally changed tokens between adjacent frames and reuses their cached key-value representations, thereby circumventing redundant computations. Additionally, to maintain action precision, VLA-Cache selectively re-computes task-relevant tokens that are environmentally sensitive, ensuring the fidelity of critical visual information. To further optimize efficiency, we introduce a layer adaptive token reusing strategy that dynamically adjusts the reuse ratio based on attention concentration across decoder layers, prioritizing critical tokens for recomputation. Extensive experiments on two simulation platforms (LIBERO and SIMPLER) and a real-world robotic system demonstrate that VLA-Cache achieves up to 1.7x speedup in CUDA latency and a 15% increase in control frequency, with negligible loss on task success rate.

However, existing approaches often fail out-of-the-box when deployed in novel environments, embodiments, or tasks. We introduce Mixture of Skills VLA (MoS-VLA), a framework that represents robot manipulation policies as linear combinations of a finite set of learned basis functions. During pretraining, MoS-VLA jointly learns these basis functions across datasets from the Open X-Embodiment project, producing a structured skill space. At test time, adapting to a new task requires only a single expert demonstration. The corresponding skill representation is then inferred via a lightweight convex optimization problem that minimizes the L1 action error, without requiring gradient updates. This gradient-free adaptation incurs minimal overhead while enabling rapid instantiation of new skills. Empirically, MoS-VLA achieves lower action-prediction error on five out of five unseen datasets and succeeds in both simulation and real-robot tasks where a pretrained VLA model fails outright.

We introduce VDRive, a novel pipeline for end-to-end autonomous driving that explicitly models state-action mapping to address these challenges, enabling interpretable and robust decision making. By leveraging the advancement of the state understanding of the Vision Language Action Model (VLA) with generative diffusion policy-based action head, our VDRive guides the driving contextually and geometrically. Contextually, VLA predicts future observations through token generation pre-training, where the observations are represented as discrete codes by a Conditional Vector Quantized Variational Autoencoder (CVQ-VAE). Geometrically, we perform reinforcement learning fine-tuning of the VLA to predict future trajectories and actions based on current driving conditions. VLA supplies the current state tokens and predicted state tokens for the action policy head to generate hierarchical actions and trajectories. During policy training, a learned critic evaluates the actions generated by the policy and provides gradient-based feedback, forming an actor-critic framework that enables a reinforcement-based policy learning pipeline. Experiments show that our VDRive achieves state-of-the-art performance in the Bench2Drive closed-loop benchmark and nuScenes open-loop planning.</p></details> | 1st version |
| **[VITA-VLA: Efficiently Teaching Vision-Language Models to Act via Action Expert Distillation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09607v2)** | 2025-10-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-Language Action (VLA) models significantly advance robotic manipulation by leveraging the strong perception capabilities of pretrained vision-language models (VLMs). By integrating action modules into these pretrained models, VLA methods exhibit improved generalization. However, training them from scratch is costly. In this work, we propose a simple yet effective distillation-based framework that equips VLMs with action-execution capability by transferring knowledge from pretrained small action models. Our architecture retains the original VLM structure, adding only an action token and a state encoder to incorporate physical inputs. To distill action knowledge, we adopt a two-stage training strategy. First, we perform lightweight alignment by mapping VLM hidden states into the action space of the small action model, enabling effective reuse of its pretrained action decoder and avoiding expensive pretraining. Second, we selectively fine-tune the language model, state encoder, and action modules, enabling the system to integrate multimodal inputs with precise action generation. Specifically, the action token provides the VLM with a direct handle for predicting future actions, while the state encoder allows the model to incorporate robot dynamics not captured by vision alone. This design yields substantial efficiency gains over training large VLA models from scratch. Compared with previous state-of-the-art methods, our method achieves 97.3% average success rate on LIBERO (11.8% improvement) and 93.5% on LIBERO-LONG (24.5% improvement). In real-world experiments across five manipulation tasks, our method consistently outperforms the teacher model, achieving 82.0% success rate (17% improvement), which demonstrate that action distillation effectively enables VLMs to generate precise actions while substantially reducing training costs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Homep...</summary><p>Homepage: https://ltbai.github.io/VITA-VLA/</p></details> |

However, their success rate drops significantly when faced with object concepts outside the training data, such as unseen object descriptions and textures in the dataset. To address this, we propose a novel agentic framework, VLA^2, which leverages OpenVLA as the execution backbone and effectively leverages external modules such as web retrieval and object detection to provide visual and textual knowledge about target objects to the VLA. This approach mitigates generalization failure when handling out-of-distribution objects. Based on the LIBERO simulation environment, we introduced novel objects and object descriptions to construct a new evaluation benchmark with three difficulty levels to test the effectiveness of our method. Our framework successfully outperformed the current state-of-the-art models on our designed hard-level generalization benchmark. Compared to the standalone OpenVLA baseline, VLA^2 achieves a 44.2% improvement in the success rate in the hard-level benchmark and an average improvement of 20.2% in all customized environments without any performance degradation on in-domain tasks.

| **[VLA-0: Building State-of-the-Art VLAs with Zero Modification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13054v1)** | 2025-10-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-Language-Action models (VLAs) hold immense promise for enabling generalist robot manipulation. However, the best way to build them remains an open question. Current approaches often add complexity, such as modifying the existing vocabulary of a Vision-Language Model (VLM) with action tokens or introducing special action heads. Curiously, the simplest strategy of representing actions directly as text has remained largely unexplored. This work introduces VLA-0 to investigate this idea. We find that VLA-0 is not only effective; it is surprisingly powerful. With the right design, VLA-0 outperforms more involved models. On LIBERO, a popular benchmark for evaluating VLAs, VLA-0 outperforms all existing methods trained on the same robotic data, including $π_0.5$-KI, OpenVLA-OFT and SmolVLA. Furthermore, without large-scale robotics-specific training, it outperforms methods trained on large-scale robotic data, like $π_0.5$-KI, $π_0$, GR00T-N1 and MolmoAct. These findings also translate to the real world, where VLA-0 outperforms SmolVLA, a VLA model pre-trained on large-scale real data. This paper summarizes our unexpected findings and spells out the specific techniques required to unlock the high performance of this simple yet potent VLA design.

| **[Reflection-Based Task Adaptation for Self-Improving VLA](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12710v1)** | 2025-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Pre-trained Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models represent a major leap towards general-purpose robots, yet efficiently adapting them to novel, specific tasks in-situ remains a significant hurdle. While reinforcement learning (RL) is a promising avenue for such adaptation, the process often suffers from low efficiency, hindering rapid task mastery. We introduce Reflective Self-Adaptation, a framework for rapid, autonomous task adaptation without human intervention. Our framework establishes a self-improving loop where the agent learns from its own experience to enhance both strategy and execution. The core of our framework is a dual-pathway architecture that addresses the full adaptation lifecycle. First, a Failure-Driven Reflective RL pathway enables rapid learning by using the VLM's causal reasoning to automatically synthesize a targeted, dense reward function from failure analysis. This provides a focused learning signal that significantly accelerates policy exploration. However, optimizing such proxy rewards introduces a potential risk of "reward hacking," where the agent masters the reward function but fails the actual task. To counteract this, our second pathway, Success-Driven Quality-Guided SFT, grounds the policy in holistic success. It identifies and selectively imitates high-quality successful trajectories, ensuring the agent remains aligned with the ultimate task goal. This pathway is strengthened by a conditional curriculum mechanism to aid initial exploration. We conduct experiments in challenging manipulation tasks. The results demonstrate that our framework achieves faster convergence and higher final success rates compared to representative baselines. Our work presents a robust solution for creating self-improving agents that can efficiently and reliably adapt to new environments.</p></details> |  |

Training VLA Models with Normalizing Flows](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16845v2)** | 2025-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have established a two-component architecture, where a pre-trained Vision-Language Model (VLM) encodes visual observations and task descriptions, and an action decoder maps these representations to continuous actions. Diffusion models have been widely adopted as action decoders due to their ability to model complex, multimodal action distributions. However, they require multiple iterative denoising steps at inference time or downstream techniques to speed up sampling, limiting their practicality in real-world settings where high-frequency control is crucial. In this work, we present NinA (Normalizing Flows in Action), a fast and expressive alternative to diffusion-based decoders for VLAs. NinA replaces the diffusion action decoder with a Normalizing Flow (NF) that enables one-shot sampling through an invertible transformation, significantly reducing inference time. We integrate NinA into the FLOWER VLA architecture and fine-tune on the LIBERO benchmark. Our experiments show that NinA matches the performance of its diffusion-based counterpart under the same training regime, while achieving substantially faster inference. These results suggest that NinA offers a promising path toward efficient, high-frequency VLA control without compromising performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>https...</summary><p>https://github.com/dunnolab/NinA/</p></details> |

To facilitate and leverage the heterogeneity in rich, diverse robotic data sources, we propose a novel Soft Prompt approach with minimally added parameters, by infusing prompt learning concepts into cross-embodiment robot learning and introducing separate sets of learnable embeddings for each distinct data source. These embeddings serve as embodiment-specific prompts, which in unity empower VLA models with effective exploitation of varying cross-embodiment features. Our new X-VLA, a neat flow-matching-based VLA architecture, relies exclusively on soft-prompted standard Transformer encoders, enjoying both scalability and simplicity. Evaluated across 6 simulations as well as 3 real-world robots, our 0.9B instantiation-X-VLA-0.9B simultaneously achieves SOTA performance over a sweep of benchmarks, demonstrating superior results on a wide axes of capabilities, from flexible dexterity to quick adaptation across embodiments, environments, and tasks.

Pruning has enabled efficient compression of large language models (LLMs), yet it is largely understudied in robotics. Surprisingly, we observe that pruning VLA models leads to drastic degradation and increased safety violations. We introduce GLUESTICK, a post-pruning recovery method that restores much of the original model's functionality while retaining sparsity benefits. Our method performs a one-time interpolation between the dense and pruned models in weight-space to compute a corrective term. This correction is used during inference by each pruned layer to recover lost capabilities with minimal overhead. GLUESTICK requires no additional training, is agnostic to the pruning algorithm, and introduces a single hyperparameter that controls the tradeoff between efficiency and accuracy. Across diverse VLA architectures and tasks in manipulation and navigation, GLUESTICK achieves competitive memory efficiency while substantially recovering success rates and reducing safety violations.

Existing methods relying on text-only instructions often struggle to generalize to unseen scenarios. We argue that interleaved image-text inputs offer richer and less biased context and enable robots to better handle unseen tasks with more versatile human-robot interaction. Building on this insight, Interleave-VLA, the first robot learning paradigm capable of comprehending interleaved image-text instructions and directly generating continuous action sequences in the physical world, is introduced. It offers a natural, flexible, and model-agnostic paradigm that extends state-of-the-art vision-language-action (VLA) models with minimal modifications while achieving strong zero-shot generalization. Interleave-VLA also includes an automatic pipeline that converts text instructions from Open X-Embodiment into interleaved image-text instructions, resulting in a large-scale real-world interleaved embodied dataset with 210k episodes. Comprehensive evaluation in simulation and the real world shows that Interleave-VLA offers two major benefits: (1) improves out-of-domain generalization to unseen objects by 2x compared to text input baselines, (2) supports flexible task interfaces and diverse instructions in a zero-shot manner, such as hand-drawn sketches. We attribute Interleave-VLA's strong zero-shot capability to the use of instruction images, which effectively mitigate hallucinations, and the inclusion of heterogeneous multimodal datasets, enriched with Internet-sourced images, offering potential for scalability.

Recent advances have enabled language-guided tracking in complex and unstructured scenes. However, existing approaches lack explicit spatial reasoning and effective temporal memory, causing failures under severe occlusions or in the presence of similar-looking distractors. To address these challenges, we present TrackVLA++, a novel Vision-Language-Action (VLA) model that enhances embodied visual tracking with two key modules, a spatial reasoning mechanism and a Target Identification Memory (TIM). The reasoning module introduces a Chain-of-Thought paradigm, termed Polar-CoT, which infers the target's relative position and encodes it as a compact polar-coordinate token for action prediction. Guided by these spatial priors, the TIM employs a gated update strategy to preserve long-horizon target memory, ensuring spatiotemporal consistency and mitigating target loss during extended occlusions. Extensive experiments show that TrackVLA++ achieves state-of-the-art performance on public benchmarks across both egocentric and multi-camera settings. On the challenging EVT-Bench DT split, TrackVLA++ surpasses the previous leading approach by 5.1 and 12, respectively. Furthermore, TrackVLA++ exhibits strong zero-shot generalization, enabling robust real-world tracking in dynamic and occluded scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://pku-epic.github.io/TrackVLA-plus-plus-Web/</p></details> |

However, their robustness to natural language variability in real-world scenarios has not been thoroughly investigated. In this work, we present a novel systematic study of the robustness of state-of-the-art VLA models under linguistic perturbations. Specifically, we evaluate model performance under two types of instruction noise: (1) human-generated paraphrasing and (2) the addition of irrelevant context. We further categorize irrelevant contexts into two groups according to their length and their semantic and lexical proximity to robot commands. In this study, we observe consistent performance degradation as context size expands. We also demonstrate that the model can exhibit relative robustness to random context, with a performance drop within 10%, while semantically and lexically similar context of the same length can trigger a quality decline of around 50%. Human paraphrases of instructions lead to a drop of nearly 20%. To mitigate this, we propose an LLM-based filtering framework that extracts core commands from noisy inputs. Incorporating our filtering step allows models to recover up to 98.5% of their original performance under noisy conditions.</p></details> |  |

Yet, most VLA models are still trained with supervised fine-tuning (SFT), which struggles to generalize under distribution shifts due to error accumulation. Reinforcement learning (RL) offers a promising alternative by directly optimizing task performance through interaction, but existing attempts remain fragmented and lack a unified platform for fair and systematic comparison across model architectures and algorithmic designs. To address this gap, we introduce RLinf-VLA, a unified and efficient framework for scalable RL training of VLA models. The system adopts a highly flexible resource allocation design that addresses the challenge of integrating rendering, training, and inference in RL+VLA training. In particular, for GPU-parallelized simulators, RLinf-VLA implements a novel hybrid fine-grained pipeline allocation mode, achieving a 1.61x-1.88x speedup in training. Through a unified interface, RLinf-VLA seamlessly supports diverse VLA architectures (e.g., OpenVLA, OpenVLA-OFT), multiple RL algorithms (e.g., PPO, GRPO), and various simulators (e.g., ManiSkill, LIBERO). In simulation, a unified model achieves 98.11\% across 130 LIBERO tasks and 97.66\% across 25 ManiSkill tasks. Beyond empirical performance, our study distills a set of best practices for applying RL to VLA training and sheds light on emerging patterns in this integration. Furthermore, we present preliminary deployment on a real-world Franka robot, where RL-trained policies exhibit stronger generalization than those trained with SFT. We envision RLinf-VLA as a foundation to accelerate and standardize research on embodied intelligence.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This is the technical report of the RLinf Team, focusing on the algorithm side.

While Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models offer a promising solution by grounding natural language instructions into single-step control commands, they often lack mechanisms for lookahead and struggle with compounding errors in dynamic tasks. In this project, we introduce Scaling Inference-Time COMpute for VLAs (SITCOM), a framework that augments any pretrained VLA with model-based rollouts and reward-based trajectory selection, inspired by Model Predictive Control algorithm. SITCOM leverages a learned dynamics model to simulate multi-step action rollouts to select the best candidate plan for real-world execution, transforming one-shot VLAs into robust long-horizon planners. We develop an efficient transformer-based dynamics model trained on large-scale BridgeV2 data and fine-tuned on SIMPLER environments to bridge the Real2Sim gap, and score candidate rollouts using rewards from simulator. Through comprehensive evaluation across multiple tasks and settings in the SIMPLER environment, we demonstrate that SITCOM when combined with a good reward function can significantly improve task completion rate from 48% to 72% using trained dynamics model.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at the NeurIPS 2025 Workshop on Space in Vision, Language, and Embodied AI (SpaVLE). *Equal contribution</p></details> |

However, optical information of visual observations is difficult to be explicitly modeled like LiDAR point clouds or depth maps, which subsequently requires intelligent models and large-scale data. To this end, we propose to leverage the intelligence of the Vision-Language-Action (VLA) model to learn diverse navigation capabilities from synthetic expert data in a teacher-student manner. Specifically, we implement the VLA model, MM-Nav, as a multi-view VLA (with 360 observations) based on pretrained large language models and visual foundation models. For large-scale navigation data, we collect expert data from three reinforcement learning (RL) experts trained with privileged depth information in three challenging tailor-made environments for different navigation capabilities: reaching, squeezing, and avoiding. We iteratively train our VLA model using data collected online from RL experts, where the training ratio is dynamically balanced based on performance on individual capabilities. Through extensive experiments in synthetic environments, we demonstrate that our model achieves strong generalization capability. Moreover, we find that our student VLA model outperforms the RL teachers, demonstrating the synergistic effect of integrating multiple capabilities.

However, their high computational cost and low execution frequency hinder their suitability for real-time tasks such as robotic manipulation and autonomous navigation. Existing VLA acceleration methods primarily focus on structural optimization, overlooking the fact that these models operate in sequential decision-making environments. As a result, temporal redundancy in sequential action generation and spatial redundancy in visual input remain unaddressed. To this end, we propose SP-VLA, a unified framework that accelerates VLA models by jointly scheduling models and pruning tokens. Specifically, we design an action-aware model scheduling mechanism that reduces temporal redundancy by dynamically switching between VLA model and a lightweight generator. Inspired by the human motion pattern of focusing on key decision points while relying on intuition for other actions, we categorize VLA actions into deliberative and intuitive, assigning the former to the VLA model and the latter to the lightweight generator, enabling frequency-adaptive execution through collaborative model scheduling. To address spatial redundancy, we further develop a spatio-semantic dual-aware token pruning method. Tokens are classified into spatial and semantic types and pruned based on their dual-aware importance to accelerate VLA inference. These two mechanisms work jointly to guide the VLA in focusing on critical actions and salient visual information, achieving effective acceleration while maintaining high accuracy. Extensive experiments show that our method achieves 1.5$\times$ lossless acceleration in LIBERO and 2.4$\times$ in SimplerEnv, with up to 6% average performance gain. Inference frequency and latency improve by 2.2$\times$ in SimplerEnv and 1.4$\times$ in LIBERO.</p></details> |  |

However, current VLA models often lack explicit step-by-step reasoning, instead emitting final actions without considering affordance constraints or geometric relations. Their post-training pipelines also rarely reinforce reasoning quality, relying primarily on supervised fine-tuning with weak reward design. To address these challenges, we present VLA-R1, a reasoning-enhanced VLA that integrates Reinforcement Learning from Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to systematically optimize both reasoning and execution. Specifically, we design an RLVR-based post-training strategy with verifiable rewards for region alignment, trajectory consistency, and output formatting, thereby strengthening reasoning robustness and execution accuracy. Moreover, we develop VLA-CoT-13K, a high-quality dataset that provides chain-of-thought supervision explicitly aligned with affordance and trajectory annotations. Furthermore, extensive evaluations on in-domain, out-of-domain, simulation, and real-robot platforms demonstrate that VLA-R1 achieves superior generalization and real-world performance compared to prior VLA methods.

Reinforcement learning (RL) can mitigate these issues yet typically demands costly real-world interactions or suffers from sim-to-real gaps. We introduce VLA-RFT, a reinforcement fine-tuning framework that leverages a data-driven world model as a controllable simulator. Trained from real interaction data, the simulator predicts future visual observations conditioned on actions, allowing policy rollouts with dense, trajectory-level rewards derived from goal-achieving references. This design delivers an efficient and action-aligned learning signal, drastically lowering sample requirements. With fewer than 400 fine-tuning steps, VLA-RFT surpasses strong supervised baselines and achieves greater efficiency than simulator-based RL. Moreover, it exhibits strong robustness under perturbed conditions, sustaining stable task execution. Our results establish world-model-based RFT as a practical post-training paradigm to enhance the generalization and robustness of VLA models.

To tackle this challenge, recent Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models build policies on top of Vision-Language Models (VLMs), seeking to transfer their open-world semantic knowledge. However, their zero-shot capability lags significantly behind the base VLMs, as the instruction-vision-action data is too limited to cover diverse scenarios, tasks, and robot embodiments. In this work, we present Goal-VLA, a zero-shot framework that leverages Image-Generative VLMs as world models to generate desired goal states, from which the target object pose is derived to enable generalizable manipulation. The key insight is that object state representation is the golden interface, naturally separating a manipulation system into high-level and low-level policies. This representation abstracts away explicit action annotations, allowing the use of highly generalizable VLMs while simultaneously providing spatial cues for training-free low-level control. To further improve robustness, we introduce a Reflection-through-Synthesis process that iteratively validates and refines the generated goal image before execution. Both simulated and real-world experiments demonstrate that our \name achieves strong performance and inspiring generalizability in manipulation tasks.

Yet, we identify two bottlenecks of LAMs: 1) the commonly adopted end-to-end trained image encoder suffers from poor spatial understanding; 2) LAMs can be fragile when input frames are distant, leading to limited temporal perception. Such factors inevitably hinder stable and clear action modeling. To this end, we propose Farsighted-LAM, a latent action framework with geometry-aware spatial encoding and multi-scale temporal modeling, capturing structural priors and dynamic motion patterns from consecutive frames. We further propose SSM-VLA, an end-to-end VLA framework built upon Farsighted-LAM, which integrates structured perception with a visual Chain-of-Thought module to explicitly reason about environmental dynamics, enhancing decision consistency and interpretability. We validate SSM-VLA on multiple VLA tasks in both simulation and real-world settings, and achieve state-of-the-art performance. Our results demonstrate that our strategy of combining geometry-aware modeling, temporal coherence, and explicit reasoning is effective in enhancing the robustness and generalizability of embodied intelligence.</p></details> |  |
| **[VLA Model Post-Training via Action-Chunked PPO and Self Behavior Cloning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25718v1)** | 2025-09-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement learning (RL) is a promising avenue for post-training vision-language-action (VLA) models, but practical deployment is hindered by sparse rewards and unstable training. This work mitigates these challenges by introducing an action chunk based on proximal policy optimization (PPO) with behavior cloning using self-collected demonstrations. Aggregating consecutive actions into chunks improves the temporal consistency of the policy and the density of informative feedback. In addition, an auxiliary behavior cloning loss is applied with a dynamically updated demonstration buffer that continually collects high-quality task trials during training. The relative weight between the action-chunked PPO objective and the self behavior clone auxiliary loss is adapted online to stabilize the post-training process. Experiments on the MetaWorld benchmark indicate improved performance over supervised fine-tuning, achieving a high success rate (0.93) and few steps to success (42.17). These results demonstrate the viability of RL for VLA post-training and help lay the groundwork for downstream VLA applications.</p></details> |  |

| **[Validating Generalist Robots with Situation Calculus and STL Falsification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03038v1)** | 2026-01-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generalist robots are becoming a reality, capable of interpreting natural language instructions and executing diverse operations. However, their validation remains challenging because each task induces its own operational context and correctness specification, exceeding the assumptions of traditional validation methods. We propose a two-layer validation framework that combines abstract reasoning with concrete system falsification. At the abstract layer, situation calculus models the world and derives weakest preconditions, enabling constraint-aware combinatorial testing to systematically generate diverse, semantically valid world-task configurations with controllable coverage strength. At the concrete layer, these configurations are instantiated for simulation-based falsification with STL monitoring. Experiments on tabletop manipulation tasks show that our framework effectively uncovers failure cases in the NVIDIA GR00T controller, demonstrating its promise for validating general-purpose robot autonomy.</p></details> |  |

We incorporate three key ingredients: 1) an internet-scale video-action dataset constructed by automatically extracting player actions from publicly available gameplay videos, 2) a multi-game benchmark environment that can measure cross-game generalization, and 3) a unified vision-action model trained with large-scale behavior cloning. NitroGen exhibits strong competence across diverse domains, including combat encounters in 3D action games, high-precision control in 2D platformers, and exploration in procedurally generated worlds. It transfers effectively to unseen games, achieving up to 52% relative improvement in task success rates over models trained from scratch. We release the dataset, evaluation suite, and model weights to advance research on generalist embodied agents.</p></details> | 16 pages, 7 figures |
| **[Reasoning Over Recall: Evaluating the Efficacy of Generalist Architectures vs. Specialized Fine-Tunes in RAG-Based Mental Health Dialogue Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01341v1)** | 2026-01-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The deployment of Large Language Models (LLMs) in mental health counseling faces the dual challenges of hallucinations and lack of empathy. While the former may be mitigated by RAG (retrieval-augmented generation) by anchoring answers in trusted clinical sources, there remains an open question as to whether the most effective model under this paradigm would be one that is fine-tuned on mental health data, or a more general and powerful model that succeeds purely on the basis of reasoning. In this paper, we perform a direct comparison by running four open-source models through the same RAG pipeline using ChromaDB: two generalist reasoners (Qwen2.5-3B and Phi-3-Mini) and two domain-specific fine-tunes (MentalHealthBot-7B and TherapyBot-7B). We use an LLM-as-a-Judge framework to automate evaluation over 50 turns. We find a clear trend: the generalist models outperform the domain-specific ones in empathy (3.72 vs. 3.26, $p < 0.001$) in spite of being much smaller (3B vs. 7B), and all models perform well in terms of safety, but the generalist models show better contextual understanding and are less prone to overfitting as we observe in the domain-specific models. Overall, our results indicate that for RAG-based therapy systems, strong reasoning is more important than training on mental health-specific vocabulary; i.e. a well-reasoned general model would provide more empathetic and balanced support than a larger narrowly fine-tuned model, so long as the answer is already grounded in clinical evidence.</p></details> |  |
| **[PolaRiS: Scalable Real-to-Sim Evaluations for Generalist Robot Policies](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16881v2)** | 2025-12-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A significant challenge for robot learning research is our ability to accurately measure and compare the performance of robot policies. Benchmarking in robotics is historically challenging due to the stochasticity, reproducibility, and time-consuming nature of real-world rollouts. This challenge is exacerbated for recent generalist policies, which has to be evaluated across a wide variety of scenes and tasks. Evaluation in simulation offers a scalable complement to real world evaluations, but the visual and physical domain gap between existing simulation benchmarks and the real world has made them an unreliable signal for policy improvement. Furthermore, building realistic and diverse simulated environments has traditionally required significant human effort and expertise. To bridge the gap, we introduce Policy Evaluation and Environment Reconstruction in Simulation (PolaRiS), a scalable real-to-sim framework for high-fidelity simulated robot evaluation. PolaRiS utilizes neural reconstruction methods to turn short video scans of real-world scenes into interactive simulation environments. Additionally, we develop a simple simulation data co-training recipe that bridges remaining real-to-sim gaps and enables zero-shot evaluation in unseen simulation environments. Through extensive paired evaluations between simulation and the real world, we demonstrate that PolaRiS evaluations provide a much stronger correlation to real world generalist policy performance than existing simulated benchmarks. Its simplicity also enables rapid creation of diverse simulated environments. As such, this work takes a step towards distributed and democratized evaluation for the next generation of robotic foundation models.</p></details> | <details><summary>Websi...</summary><p>Website: https://polaris-evals.github.io/</p></details> |

While prior research examines effects on banned communities or source platform health, the impact on alternative platforms that absorb displaced users remains understudied. We analyze four major Reddit ban waves (2015--2020) and their effects on generalist communities on Voat, asking how post-ban arrivals reshape community structure and through what mechanisms transformation occurs. Combining network analysis, toxicity detection, and dynamic reputation modeling, we identify two distinct regimes of migration impact: (1) Hostile Takeover (2015--2018), where post-ban arrival cohorts formed parallel social structures that bypassed existing community cores through sheer volume, and (2) Toxic Equilibrium (2018--2020), where the flattening of existing user hierarchy enabled newcomers to integrate into the now-dominant toxic community. Crucially, community transformation occurred through peripheral dynamics rather than hub capture: fewer than 5% of newcomers achieved central positions in most months, yet toxicity doubled. Migration structure also shaped outcomes: loosely organized communities dispersed into generalist spaces, while ideologically cohesive groups concentrated in dedicated enclaves. These findings suggest that receiving platforms face a narrow intervention window during the hostile takeover phase, after which toxic norms become self-sustaining.</p></details> |  |
| **[Enabling Ultra-Fast Cardiovascular Imaging Across Heterogeneous Clinical Environments with a Generalist Foundation Model and Multimodal Database](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21652v1)** | 2025-12-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging provides comprehensive and non-invasive insights into cardiovascular disease (CVD) diagnosis and underlying mechanisms. Despite decades of advancements, its widespread clinical adoption remains constrained by prolonged scan times and heterogeneity across medical environments. This underscores the urgent need for a generalist reconstruction foundation model for ultra-fast CMR imaging, one capable of adapting across diverse imaging scenarios and serving as the essential substrate for all downstream analyses. To enable this goal, we curate MMCMR-427K, the largest and most comprehensive multimodal CMR k-space database to date, comprising 427,465 multi-coil k-space data paired with structured metadata across 13 international centers, 12 CMR modalities, 15 scanners, and 17 CVD categories in populations across three continents. Building on this unprecedented resource, we introduce CardioMM, a generalist reconstruction foundation model capable of dynamically adapting to heterogeneous fast CMR imaging scenarios. CardioMM unifies semantic contextual understanding with physics-informed data consistency to deliver robust reconstructions across varied scanners, protocols, and patient presentations. Comprehensive evaluations demonstrate that CardioMM achieves state-of-the-art performance in the internal centers and exhibits strong zero-shot generalization to unseen external settings. Even at imaging acceleration up to 24x, CardioMM reliably preserves key cardiac phenotypes, quantitative myocardial biomarkers, and diagnostic image quality, enabling a substantial increase in CMR examination throughput without compromising clinical integrity. Together, our open-access MMCMR-427K database and CardioMM framework establish a scalable pathway toward high-throughput, high-quality, and clinically accessible cardiovascular imaging.</p></details> | <details><summary>Githu...</summary><p>Github: https://github.com/wangziblake/CardioMM_MMCMR-427K</p></details> |
| **[Forging a Dynamic Memory: Retrieval-Guided Continual Learning for Generalist Medical Foundation Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13072v1)** | 2025-12-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal biomedical Vision-Language Models (VLMs) exhibit immense potential in the field of Continual Learning (CL). However, they confront a core dilemma: how to preserve fine-grained intra-modality features while bridging the significant domain gap across different modalities. To address this challenge, we propose a comprehensive framework. Leveraging our 18-million multimodal and comprehensive medical retrieval database derived from PubMed scientific papers, we pioneer the integration of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) into CL. Specifically, we employ a multi-modal, multi-layer RAG system that provides real-time guidance for model fine-tuning through dynamic, on-demand knowledge retrieval. Building upon this, we introduce a dynamic knowledge distillation framework. This framework precisely resolves the aforementioned core dilemma by dynamically modulating the importance of the parameter space, the granularity of the distilled knowledge, and the data distribution of the reference dataset in accordance with the required level of detail. To thoroughly validate the clinical value of our strategy, we have designed a more rigorous \textbf{M}edical Generalist Task Incremental Learning (MGTIL) benchmark. This benchmark is engineered to simultaneously evaluate the model's capacity for adaptation to significant domain shifts, retention of subtle intra-domain features, and real-time learning of novel and complex medical tasks. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our proposed method achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance across all metrics. The code is provided in the supplementary materials.</p></details> |  |
| **[From Benchmarks to Business Impact: Deploying IBM Generalist Agent in Enterprise Production](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23856v2)** | 2025-12-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Agents are rapidly advancing in automating digital work, but enterprises face a harder challenge: moving beyond prototypes to deployed systems that deliver measurable business value. This path is complicated by fragmented frameworks, slow development, and the absence of standardized evaluation practices. Generalist agents have emerged as a promising direction, excelling on academic benchmarks and offering flexibility across task types, applications, and modalities. Yet, evidence of their use in production enterprise settings remains limited. This paper reports IBM's experience developing and piloting the Computer Using Generalist Agent (CUGA), which has been open-sourced for the community (https://github.com/cuga-project/cuga-agent). CUGA adopts a hierarchical planner--executor architecture with strong analytical foundations, achieving state-of-the-art performance on AppWorld and WebArena. Beyond benchmarks, it was evaluated in a pilot within the Business-Process-Outsourcing talent acquisition domain, addressing enterprise requirements for scalability, auditability, safety, and governance. To support assessment, we introduce BPO-TA, a 26-task benchmark spanning 13 analytics endpoints. In preliminary evaluations, CUGA approached the accuracy of specialized agents while indicating potential for reducing development time and cost. Our contribution is twofold: presenting early evidence of generalist agents operating at enterprise scale, and distilling technical and organizational lessons from this initial pilot. We outline requirements and next steps for advancing research-grade architectures like CUGA into robust, enterprise-ready systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>AAAI ...</summary><p>AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence</p></details> |

Built upon a Gemini foundation model, SIMA 2 represents a significant step toward active, goal-directed interaction within an embodied environment. Unlike prior work (e.g., SIMA 1) limited to simple language commands, SIMA 2 acts as an interactive partner, capable of reasoning about high-level goals, conversing with the user, and handling complex instructions given through language and images. Across a diverse portfolio of games, SIMA 2 substantially closes the gap with human performance and demonstrates robust generalization to previously unseen environments, all while retaining the base model's core reasoning capabilities. Furthermore, we demonstrate a capacity for open-ended self-improvement: by leveraging Gemini to generate tasks and provide rewards, SIMA 2 can autonomously learn new skills from scratch in a new environment. This work validates a path toward creating versatile and continuously learning agents for both virtual and, eventually, physical worlds.</p></details> |  |
| **[Large Language Models as Generalist Policies for Network Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11839v1)** | 2025-12-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Designing control policies to ensure robust network services is essential to modern digital infrastructure. However, the dominant paradigm for network optimization relies on designing specialist policies based on handcrafted rules or deep learning models, leading to poor generalization across diverse tasks and environments. In contrast, large language models (LLMs), pretrained on Internet-scale corpora, provide a rich and unified knowledge base that encodes fundamental networking principles. Combined with their emergent abilities in generalization to unseen scenarios, LLMs offer a transformative foundation for generalist network policies that can generalize across diverse tasks and environments with minimal adaptation. In this paper, we present Trailblazer, the first systematic framework to realize such a generalist policy for networking. Trailblazer incorporates a network alignment scheme to ground the LLM in specific networking tasks, and an adaptive policy collaboration mechanism that offloads simple control cases from the LLM to a lightweight policy for computational efficiency. Through extensive simulations and large-scale real-world online evaluation on Douyin (the Chinese version of TikTok), Trailblazer, powered by a single LLM, demonstrates stronger cross-task and cross-environment generalization than conventional specialist policies. Our results validate LLMs as the foundation for generalist network policies, and position Trailblazer as the first step toward the generalist-driven paradigm that enables strong generalization with minimal efforts in policy design.</p></details> | <details><summary>In su...</summary><p>In submission.

Yet, unlike frontier models, these clinical tools are rarely subjected to independent, quantitative evaluation, creating a critical evidence gap despite their growing influence on diagnosis, triage, and guideline interpretation. We assessed two widely deployed clinical AI systems (OpenEvidence and UpToDate Expert AI) against three state-of-the-art generalist LLMs (GPT-5, Gemini 3 Pro, and Claude Sonnet 4.5) using a 1,000-item mini-benchmark combining MedQA (medical knowledge) and HealthBench (clinician-alignment) tasks. Generalist models consistently outperformed clinical tools, with GPT-5 achieving the highest scores, while OpenEvidence and UpToDate demonstrated deficits in completeness, communication quality, context awareness, and systems-based safety reasoning. These findings reveal that tools marketed for clinical decision support may often lag behind frontier LLMs, underscoring the urgent need for transparent, independent evaluation before deployment in patient-facing workflows.</p></details> | <details><summary>17 pa...</summary><p>17 pages, 4 figures (2 regular, 2 supplemental)</p></details> |
| **[RoboArena: Distributed Real-World Evaluation of Generalist Robot Policies](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18123v2)** | 2025-11-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Comprehensive, unbiased, and comparable evaluation of modern generalist policies is uniquely challenging: existing approaches for robot benchmarking typically rely on heavy standardization, either by specifying fixed evaluation tasks and environments, or by hosting centralized ''robot challenges'', and do not readily scale to evaluating generalist policies across a broad range of tasks and environments. In this work, we propose RoboArena, a new approach for scalable evaluation of generalist robot policies in the real world. Instead of standardizing evaluations around fixed tasks, environments, or locations, we propose to crowd-source evaluations across a distributed network of evaluators. Importantly, evaluators can freely choose the tasks and environments they evaluate on, enabling easy scaling of diversity, but they are required to perform double-blind evaluations over pairs of policies. Then, by aggregating preference feedback from pairwise comparisons across diverse tasks and environments, we can derive a ranking of policies. We instantiate our approach across a network of evaluators at seven academic institutions using the DROID robot platform. Through more than 600 pairwise real-robot evaluation episodes across seven generalist policies, we demonstrate that our crowd-sourced approach can more accurately rank the performance of existing generalist policies than conventional, centralized evaluation approaches, while being more scalable, resilient, and trustworthy. We open our evaluation network to the community and hope that it can enable more accessible comparisons of generalist robot policies.</p></details> | <details><summary>Websi...</summary><p>Website: https://robo-arena.github.io/</p></details> |

To bridge this gap, we propose UMind-VL, a unified foundation model designed to synergize pixel-level structural understanding with complex clinical reasoning. We first introduce UMind-DS, a large-scale multimodal dataset comprising 1.2 million ultrasound image-text pairs across 16 anatomical regions, enriching standard data with pixel-level annotations and clinician-validated rationales. Architecturally, UMind-VL incorporates a lightweight Dynamic Convolutional Mask Decoder that generates masks via dynamic kernels conditioned on LLM outputs. This design, combined with task-specific tokens, unifies segmentation, detection, geometric measurement, and diagnosis tasks within a single framework. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that UMind-VL significantly outperforms existing generalist multimodal models and achieves performance on par with, or superior to, state-of-the-art specialist models across segmentation, detection, keypoint localization, and diagnostic reasoning benchmarks, while maintaining strong generalization ability. We demonstrate the capability of UMind-VL in Figure 1.</p></details> |  |
| **[Health system learning achieves generalist neuroimaging models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18640v1)** | 2025-11-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Frontier artificial intelligence (AI) models, such as OpenAI's GPT-5 and Meta's DINOv3, have advanced rapidly through training on internet-scale public data, yet such systems lack access to private clinical data. Neuroimaging, in particular, is underrepresented in the public domain due to identifiable facial features within MRI and CT scans, fundamentally restricting model performance in clinical medicine. Here, we show that frontier models underperform on neuroimaging tasks and that learning directly from uncurated data generated during routine clinical care at health systems, a paradigm we call health system learning, yields high-performance, generalist neuroimaging models. We introduce NeuroVFM, a visual foundation model trained on 5.24 million clinical MRI and CT volumes using a scalable volumetric joint-embedding predictive architecture. NeuroVFM learns comprehensive representations of brain anatomy and pathology, achieving state-of-the-art performance across multiple clinical tasks, including radiologic diagnosis and report generation. The model exhibits emergent neuroanatomic understanding and interpretable visual grounding of diagnostic findings. When paired with open-source language models through lightweight visual instruction tuning, NeuroVFM generates radiology reports that surpass frontier models in accuracy, clinical triage, and expert preference. Through clinically grounded visual understanding, NeuroVFM reduces hallucinated findings and critical errors, offering safer clinical decision support. These results establish health system learning as a paradigm for building generalist medical AI and provide a scalable framework for clinical foundation models.</p></details> | <details><summary>53 pa...</summary><p>53 pages, 4 main figures, 10 extended data figures</p></details> |

We pursue a road less traveled: building generalist policies directly around VLMs by augmenting their general capabilities with specific robot capabilities encapsulated in a carefully curated set of perception, planning, and control modules. In Maestro, a VLM coding agent dynamically composes these modules into a programmatic policy for the current task and scenario. Maestro's architecture benefits from a streamlined closed-loop interface without many manually imposed structural constraints, and a comprehensive and diverse tool repertoire. As a result, it largely surpasses today's VLA models for zero-shot performance on challenging manipulation skills. Further, Maestro is easily extensible to incorporate new modules, easily editable to suit new embodiments such as a quadruped-mounted arm, and even easily adapts from minimal real-world experiences through local code edits.</p></details> | <details><summary>Plan ...</summary><p>Plan to resubmit after significant revisions</p></details> |

Despite strong performance on medical knowledge and conversational benchmarks, foundation models trained on general text may lack the specialized knowledge required for these operational decisions. We introduce Lang1, a family of models (100M-7B parameters) pretrained on a specialized corpus blending 80B clinical tokens from NYU Langone Health's EHRs and 627B tokens from the internet. To rigorously evaluate Lang1 in real-world settings, we developed the REalistic Medical Evaluation (ReMedE), a benchmark derived from 668,331 EHR notes that evaluates five critical tasks: 30-day readmission prediction, 30-day mortality prediction, length of stay, comorbidity coding, and predicting insurance claims denial. In zero-shot settings, both general-purpose and specialized models underperform on four of five tasks (36.6%-71.7% AUROC), with mortality prediction being an exception. After finetuning, Lang1-1B outperforms finetuned generalist models up to 70x larger and zero-shot models up to 671x larger, improving AUROC by 3.64%-6.75% and 1.66%-23.66% respectively. We also observed cross-task scaling with joint finetuning on multiple tasks leading to improvement on other tasks. Lang1-1B effectively transfers to out-of-distribution settings, including other clinical tasks and an external health system. Our findings suggest that predictive capabilities for hospital operations require explicit supervised finetuning, and that this finetuning process is made more efficient by in-domain pretraining on EHR. Our findings support the emerging view that specialized LLMs can compete with generalist models in specialized tasks, and show that effective healthcare systems AI requires the combination of in-domain pretraining, supervised finetuning, and real-world evaluation beyond proxy benchmarks.</p></details> |  |

Across mathematics and physics Olympiads (IMO, IMC, IPhO, CPhO), SciAgent consistently attains or surpasses human gold-medalist performance, demonstrating both domain generality and reasoning adaptability. Additionally, SciAgent has been tested on the International Chemistry Olympiad (IChO) and selected problems from the Humanity's Last Exam (HLE) benchmark, further confirming the system's ability to generalize across diverse scientific domains.

Here we introduce MATAI, a generalist machine learning framework for property prediction and inverse design of as-cast alloys. MATAI integrates a curated alloy database, deep neural network-based property predictors, a constraint-aware optimization engine, and an iterative AI-experiment feedback loop. The framework estimates key mechanical propertie, sincluding density, yield strength, ultimate tensile strength, and elongation, directly from composition, using multi-task learning and physics-informed inductive biases. Alloy design is framed as a constrained optimization problem and solved using a bi-level approach that combines local search with symbolic constraint programming. We demonstrate MATAI's capabilities on the Ti-based alloy system, a canonical class of lightweight structural materials, where it rapidly identifies candidates that simultaneously achieve lower density (<4.45 g/cm3), higher strength (>1000 MPa) and appreciable ductility (>5%) through only seven iterations. Experimental validation confirms that MATAI-designed alloys outperform commercial references such as TC4, highlighting the framework's potential to accelerate the discovery of lightweight, high-performance materials under real-world design constraints.</p></details> |  |

Lumine adopts a human-like interaction paradigm that unifies perception, reasoning, and action in an end-to-end manner, powered by a vision-language model. It processes raw pixels at 5 Hz to produce precise 30 Hz keyboard-mouse actions and adaptively invokes reasoning only when necessary. Trained in Genshin Impact, Lumine successfully completes the entire five-hour Mondstadt main storyline on par with human-level efficiency and follows natural language instructions to perform a broad spectrum of tasks in both 3D open-world exploration and 2D GUI manipulation across collection, combat, puzzle-solving, and NPC interaction. In addition to its in-domain performance, Lumine demonstrates strong zero-shot cross-game generalization. Without any fine-tuning, it accomplishes 100-minute missions in Wuthering Waves and the full five-hour first chapter of Honkai: Star Rail. These promising results highlight Lumine's effectiveness across distinct worlds and interaction dynamics, marking a concrete step toward generalist agents in open-ended environments.</p></details> |  |

To bridge this gap, we introduce UniVA, an open-source, omni-capable multi-agent framework for next-generation video generalists that unifies video understanding, segmentation, editing, and generation into cohesive workflows. UniVA employs a Plan-and-Act dual-agent architecture that drives a highly automated and proactive workflow: a planner agent interprets user intentions and decomposes them into structured video-processing steps, while executor agents execute these through modular, MCP-based tool servers (for analysis, generation, editing, tracking, etc.). Through a hierarchical multi-level memory (global knowledge, task context, and user-specific preferences), UniVA sustains long-horizon reasoning, contextual continuity, and inter-agent communication, enabling interactive and self-reflective video creation with full traceability. This design enables iterative and any-conditioned video workflows (e.g., text/image/video-conditioned generation $\rightarrow$ multi-round editing $\rightarrow$ object segmentation $\rightarrow$ compositional synthesis) that were previously cumbersome to achieve with single-purpose models or monolithic video-language models. We also introduce UniVA-Bench, a benchmark suite of multi-step video tasks spanning understanding, editing, segmentation, and generation, to rigorously evaluate such agentic video systems. Both UniVA and UniVA-Bench are fully open-sourced, aiming to catalyze research on interactive, agentic, and general-purpose video intelligence for the next generation of multimodal AI systems.

While existing grounding models achieve promising performance to simulate the mouse click action on various click-based benchmarks, another essential mode of mouse interaction, namely dragging, remains largely underexplored. Yet, dragging the mouse to select and manipulate textual content represents a prevalent and important usage in practical GUI scenarios. To narrow this gap, we first introduce GUI-Drag, a diverse dataset of 161K text dragging examples synthesized through a scalable pipeline. To support systematic and robust evaluation, we further construct ScreenDrag, a benchmark with 5,333 examples spanning three levels of interface context, together with three dedicated metrics designed for assessing text dragging capability. Models trained on GUI-Drag with an efficient continual training strategy achieve substantial improvements on ScreenDrag, while preserving the original click-based performance on ScreenSpot, ScreenSpot-v2, and OSWorld-G. Our work encourages further research on broader GUI grounding beyond just clicking and paves way toward a truly generalist GUI grounding model. All benchmark, data, checkpoints, and code are open-sourced and available at https://osu-nlp-group.github.io/GUI-Drag.</p></details> | 29 pages |

In this paper, we introduce Hulu-Med, a transparent, generalist medical Vision-Language Model (VLM) designed to unify language-only, 2D/3D vision-language, and video understanding within a single architecture. Hulu-Med is trained on a curated corpus of 16.7 million samples, comprising exclusively public or synthetic data, spanning 12 major anatomical systems and 14 medical imaging modalities. Hulu-Med employs a medical-aware token-reduction strategy that prunes redundant visual tokens, achieving up to a 55% reduction for 3D and video inputs, improving cross-modal efficiency, and enabling training at 7B-32B parameter scales in approximately 4,000-40,000 GPU hours. Across 30 public in-domain and out-of-domain medical benchmarks-covering text reasoning, visual question answering, report generation, multilingual dialogue, video understanding, and rare disease diagnosis-Hulu-Med surpasses existing open-source models on 27 of 30 benchmarks and outperforms proprietary systems such as GPT-4o on 16 benchmarks. Despite being a VLM, Hulu-Med outperforms GPT-4o and matches GPT-o1 on the text-only HealthBench. For the first time in the community, we provide a fully transparent, reproducible and cost-effective pipeline for holistic medical vision-language understanding by releasing our end-to-end data curation, training procedures, and model parameters. Code and models are available at https://github.com/ZJUI-AI4H/Hulu-Med.</p></details> |  |

However, traditional LLM structures including Transformer, Linear Attention, and hybrid models do not employ specialized memory mechanism guided by task information. In this paper, we present Nirvana, an SGM with specialized memory mechanism, linear time complexity, and test-time task information extraction. Besides, we propose the Task-Aware Memory Trigger ($\textit{Trigger}$) that flexibly adjusts memory mechanism based on the current task's requirements. In Trigger, each incoming sample is treated as a self-supervised fine-tuning task, enabling Nirvana to adapt its task-related parameters on the fly to domain shifts. We also design the Specialized Memory Updater ($\textit{Updater}$) that dynamically memorizes the context guided by Trigger. We conduct experiments on both general language tasks and specialized medical tasks. On a variety of natural language modeling benchmarks, Nirvana achieves competitive or superior results compared to the existing LLM structures. To prove the effectiveness of Trigger on specialized tasks, we test Nirvana's performance on a challenging medical task, i.e., Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI). We post-train frozen Nirvana backbone with lightweight codecs on paired electromagnetic signals and MRI images. Despite the frozen Nirvana backbone, Trigger guides the model to adapt to the MRI domain with the change of task-related parameters. Nirvana achieves higher-quality MRI reconstruction compared to conventional MRI models as well as the models with traditional LLMs' backbone, and can also generate accurate preliminary clinical reports accordingly.</p></details> |  |

Previous methods typically rely on domain-specific training data and manual adjustments when applying to new scenarios and unseen anomaly types, suffering from high labor costs and limited generalization. Therefore, we aim to achieve generalist VAD, \ie, automatically handle any scene and any anomaly types without training data or human involvement. In this work, we propose PANDA, an agentic AI engineer based on MLLMs. Specifically, we achieve PANDA by comprehensively devising four key capabilities: (1) self-adaptive scene-aware strategy planning, (2) goal-driven heuristic reasoning, (3) tool-augmented self-reflection, and (4) self-improving chain-of-memory. Concretely, we develop a self-adaptive scene-aware RAG mechanism, enabling PANDA to retrieve anomaly-specific knowledge for anomaly detection strategy planning. Next, we introduce a latent anomaly-guided heuristic prompt strategy to enhance reasoning precision. Furthermore, PANDA employs a progressive reflection mechanism alongside a suite of context-aware tools to iteratively refine decision-making in complex scenarios. Finally, a chain-of-memory mechanism enables PANDA to leverage historical experiences for continual performance improvement. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PANDA achieves state-of-the-art performance in multi-scenario, open-set, and complex scenario settings without training and manual involvement, validating its generalizable and robust anomaly detection capability.

However, despite the potential of text inpainting methods, three key limitations hinder their applicability to broader Text Image Manipulation (TIM) tasks: (i) the inability to remove text, (ii) the lack of control over the style of rendered text, and (iii) a tendency to generate duplicated letters. To address these challenges, we propose OmniText, a training-free generalist capable of performing a wide range of TIM tasks. Specifically, we investigate two key properties of cross- and self-attention mechanisms to enable text removal and to provide control over both text styles and content. Our findings reveal that text removal can be achieved by applying self-attention inversion, which mitigates the model's tendency to focus on surrounding text, thus reducing text hallucinations. Additionally, we redistribute cross-attention, as increasing the probability of certain text tokens reduces text hallucination. For controllable inpainting, we introduce novel loss functions in a latent optimization framework: a cross-attention content loss to improve text rendering accuracy and a self-attention style loss to facilitate style customization. Furthermore, we present OmniText-Bench, a benchmark dataset for evaluating diverse TIM tasks. It includes input images, target text with masks, and style references, covering diverse applications such as text removal, rescaling, repositioning, and insertion and editing with various styles. Our OmniText framework is the first generalist method capable of performing diverse TIM tasks. It achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple tasks and metrics compared to other text inpainting methods and is comparable with specialist methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>The f...</summary><p>The first two authors contributed equally to this work.

Unlike API- or GUI-based approaches, this paradigm enables large-scale continual pre-training across heterogeneous domains, including OS, web, and simulation games. Game-TARS is pre-trained on over 500B tokens with diverse trajectories and multimodal data. Key techniques include a decaying continual loss to reduce causal confusion and an efficient Sparse-Thinking strategy that balances reasoning depth and inference cost. Experiments show that Game-TARS achieves about 2 times the success rate over the previous sota model on open-world Minecraft tasks, is close to the generality of fresh humans in unseen web 3d games, and outperforms GPT-5, Gemini-2.5-Pro, and Claude-4-Sonnet in FPS benchmarks. Scaling results on training-time and test-time confirm that the unified action space sustains improvements when scaled to cross-game and multimodal data. Our results demonstrate that simple, scalable action representations combined with large-scale pre-training provide a promising path toward generalist agents with broad computer-use abilities.</p></details> |  |

To address the above challenges, we propose Omni-Reward, a step toward generalist omni-modal reward modeling with support for free-form preferences, consisting of: (1) Evaluation: We introduce Omni-RewardBench, the first omni-modal RM benchmark with free-form preferences, covering nine tasks across five modalities including text, image, video, audio, and 3D; (2) Data: We construct Omni-RewardData, a multimodal preference dataset comprising 248K general preference pairs and 69K instruction-tuning pairs for training generalist omni-modal RMs; (3) Model: We propose Omni-RewardModel, which includes both discriminative and generative RMs, and achieves strong performance on Omni-RewardBench as well as other widely used reward modeling benchmarks.</p></details> | 48 pages, 17 figures |

Yet their rapid rise raises a key question: should researchers train specialist models from scratch, fine-tune generalist foundation models, or use hybrid approaches? The trade-offs in data efficiency, accuracy, cost, and robustness to out-of-distribution failure remain unclear. We introduce a benchmarking framework using defect migration pathways, evaluated through nudged elastic band trajectories, as diagnostic probes that test both interpolation and extrapolation. Using Cr-doped Sb2Te3 as a representative two-dimensional material, we benchmark multiple training paradigms within the MACE architecture across equilibrium, kinetic (atomic migration), and mechanical (interlayer sliding) tasks. Fine-tuned models substantially outperform from-scratch and zero-shot approaches for kinetic properties but show partial loss of long-range physics. Representational analysis reveals distinct, non-overlapping latent encodings, indicating that different training strategies learn different aspects of system physics. This framework provides practical guidelines for MLFF development and establishes migration-based probes as efficient diagnostics linking performance to learned representations, guiding future uncertainty-aware active learning.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages (+Appendix 22 pages), 8 figures.

| **[Normal-Abnormal Guided Generalist Anomaly Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00495v3)** | 2025-10-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generalist Anomaly Detection (GAD) aims to train a unified model on an original domain that can detect anomalies in new target domains. Previous GAD methods primarily use only normal samples as references, overlooking the valuable information contained in anomalous samples that are often available in real-world scenarios. To address this limitation, we propose a more practical approach: normal-abnormal-guided generalist anomaly detection, which leverages both normal and anomalous samples as references to guide anomaly detection across diverse domains. We introduce the Normal-Abnormal Generalist Learning (NAGL) framework, consisting of two key components: Residual Mining (RM) and Anomaly Feature Learning (AFL). RM extracts abnormal patterns from normal-abnormal reference residuals to establish transferable anomaly representations, while AFL adaptively learns anomaly features in query images through residual mapping to identify instance-aware anomalies. Our approach effectively utilizes both normal and anomalous references for more accurate and efficient cross-domain anomaly detection. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing GAD approaches. This work represents the first to adopt a mixture of normal and abnormal samples as references in generalist anomaly detection. The code and datasets are available at https://github.com/JasonKyng/NAGL.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by NeurIPS 2025</p></details> |

In this task, current open-source models present a large performance gap with commercial ones, which limits various applications such as data synthesis. To bridge the gap, this paper proposes CapFlow, a novel multi-agent collaboration workflow. CapFlow demonstrates for the first time that, by capitalizing on open-source models, it is possible to achieve caption quality on par with GPT-4.1 in various domains with an 89.5% reduction in costs. By leveraging CapFlow as the data synthesizer, we produce high-quality visual captions from image and video domains at scale, and obtain a generalist visual captioner via fine-tuning, namely MetaCaptioner. Through extensive experiments, we show that MetaCaptioner not only achieves comparable captioning capabilities with commercial models but also reaches top-tier multimodal performance in the open-source community. We hope CapFlow and MetaCaptioner can benefit future multimodal research by providing a strong and cost-effective visual captioning solution.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards Generalist Intelligence in Dentistry: Vision Foundation Models for Oral and Maxillofacial Radiology](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14532v1)** | 2025-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Oral and maxillofacial radiology plays a vital role in dental healthcare, but radiographic image interpretation is limited by a shortage of trained professionals. While AI approaches have shown promise, existing dental AI systems are restricted by their single-modality focus, task-specific design, and reliance on costly labeled data, hindering their generalization across diverse clinical scenarios. To address these challenges, we introduce DentVFM, the first family of vision foundation models (VFMs) designed for dentistry. DentVFM generates task-agnostic visual representations for a wide range of dental applications and uses self-supervised learning on DentVista, a large curated dental imaging dataset with approximately 1.6 million multi-modal radiographic images from various medical centers. DentVFM includes 2D and 3D variants based on the Vision Transformer (ViT) architecture. To address gaps in dental intelligence assessment and benchmarks, we introduce DentBench, a comprehensive benchmark covering eight dental subspecialties, more diseases, imaging modalities, and a wide geographical distribution. DentVFM shows impressive generalist intelligence, demonstrating robust generalization to diverse dental tasks, such as disease diagnosis, treatment analysis, biomarker identification, and anatomical landmark detection and segmentation. Experimental results indicate DentVFM significantly outperforms supervised, self-supervised, and weakly supervised baselines, offering superior generalization, label efficiency, and scalability. Additionally, DentVFM enables cross-modality diagnostics, providing more reliable results than experienced dentists in situations where conventional imaging is unavailable. DentVFM sets a new paradigm for dental AI, offering a scalable, adaptable, and label-efficient model to improve intelligent dental healthcare and address critical gaps in global oral healthcare.</p></details> |  |

They have been extensively applied to tasks in Natural Language Processing and Computer Vision with models such as GPT, BERT, and CLIP. They are now also increasingly gaining attention in time-series analysis, particularly for physiological sensing. However, most time series foundation models are specialist models - with data in pre-training and testing of the same type, such as Electrocardiogram, Electroencephalogram, and Photoplethysmogram (PPG). Recent works, such as MOMENT, train a generalist time series foundation model with data from multiple domains, such as weather, traffic, and electricity. This paper aims to conduct a comprehensive benchmarking study to compare the performance of generalist and specialist models, with a focus on PPG signals. Through an extensive suite of total 51 tasks covering cardiac state assessment, laboratory value estimation, and cross-modal inference, we comprehensively evaluate both models across seven dimensions, including win score, average performance, feature quality, tuning gain, performance variance, transferability, and scalability. These metrics jointly capture not only the models' capability but also their adaptability, robustness, and efficiency under different fine-tuning strategies, providing a holistic understanding of their strengths and limitations for diverse downstream scenarios. In a full-tuning scenario, we demonstrate that the specialist model achieves a 27% higher win score. Finally, we provide further analysis on generalization, fairness, attention visualizations, and the importance of training data choice.</p></details> |  |

Its core idea is spatially guided vision-language-action training, where spatial grounding serves as the critical link between instructions and robot actions. InternVLA-M1 employs a two-stage pipeline: (i) spatial grounding pre-training on over 2.3M spatial reasoning data to determine ``where to act'' by aligning instructions with visual, embodiment-agnostic positions, and (ii) spatially guided action post-training to decide ``how to act'' by generating embodiment-aware actions through plug-and-play spatial prompting. This spatially guided training recipe yields consistent gains: InternVLA-M1 outperforms its variant without spatial guidance by +14.6% on SimplerEnv Google Robot, +17% on WidowX, and +4.3% on LIBERO Franka, while demonstrating stronger spatial reasoning capability in box, point, and trace prediction. To further scale instruction following, we built a simulation engine to collect 244K generalizable pick-and-place episodes, enabling a 6.2% average improvement across 200 tasks and 3K+ objects. In real-world clustered pick-and-place, InternVLA-M1 improved by 7.3%, and with synthetic co-training, achieved +20.6% on unseen objects and novel configurations. Moreover, in long-horizon reasoning-intensive scenarios, it surpassed existing works by over 10%. These results highlight spatially guided training as a unifying principle for scalable and resilient generalist robots.

| **[Generalist++: A Meta-learning Framework for Mitigating Trade-off in Adversarial Training](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13361v1)** | 2025-10-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite the rapid progress of neural networks, they remain highly vulnerable to adversarial examples, for which adversarial training (AT) is currently the most effective defense. While AT has been extensively studied, its practical applications expose two major limitations: natural accuracy tends to degrade significantly compared with standard training, and robustness does not transfer well across attacks crafted under different norm constraints. Unlike prior works that attempt to address only one issue within a single network, we propose to partition the overall generalization goal into multiple sub-tasks, each assigned to a dedicated base learner. By specializing in its designated objective, each base learner quickly becomes an expert in its field. In the later stages of training, we interpolate their parameters to form a knowledgeable global learner, while periodically redistributing the global parameters back to the base learners to prevent their optimization trajectories from drifting too far from the shared target. We term this framework Generalist and introduce three variants tailored to different application scenarios. Both theoretical analysis and extensive experiments demonstrate that Generalist achieves lower generalization error and significantly alleviates the trade-off problems compared with baseline methods. Our results suggest that Generalist provides a promising step toward developing fully robust classifiers in the future.</p></details> |  |

We leverage text-to-image diffusion models pre-trained on billions of images and successfully introduce our DICEPTION, a visual generalist model. Exhaustive evaluations demonstrate that DICEPTION effectively tackles diverse perception tasks, even achieving performance comparable to SOTA single-task specialist models. Specifically, we achieve results on par with SAM-vit-h using only 0.06% of their data (e.g., 600K vs.\ 1B pixel-level annotated images). We designed comprehensive experiments on architectures and input paradigms, demonstrating that the key to successfully re-purposing a single diffusion model for multiple perception tasks lies in maximizing the preservation of the pre-trained model's prior knowledge. Consequently, DICEPTION can be trained with substantially lower computational costs than conventional models requiring training from scratch. Furthermore, adapting DICEPTION to novel tasks is highly efficient, necessitating fine-tuning on as few as 50 images and approximately 1% of its parameters. Finally, we demonstrate that a subtle application of classifier-free guidance can improve the model's performance on depth and normal estimation. We also show that pixel-aligned training, as is characteristic of perception tasks, significantly enhances the model's ability to preserve fine details. DICEPTION offers valuable insights and presents a promising direction for the development of advanced diffusion-based visual generalist models.

However, data availability is often restricted in the medical domain due to patient privacy concerns. Synthetic data presents a possible solution to these challenges. Recently, image generative models have found increasing use for medical applications but are often designed for singular medical specialties and imaging modalities, thus limiting their broader utility. To address this, we introduce MediSyn: a text-guided, latent diffusion model capable of generating synthetic images from 6 medical specialties and 10 image types. Through extensive experimentation, we first demonstrate that MediSyn quantitatively matches or surpasses the performance of specialist models. Second, we show that our synthetic images are realistic and exhibit strong alignment with their corresponding text prompts, as validated by a team of expert physicians. Third, we provide empirical evidence that our synthetic images are visually distinct from their corresponding real patient images. Finally, we demonstrate that in data-limited settings, classifiers trained solely on synthetic data or real data supplemented with synthetic data can outperform those trained solely on real data. Our findings highlight the immense potential of generalist image generative models to accelerate algorithmic research and development in medicine.</p></details> |  |
| **[Scaling Generalist Data-Analytic Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25084v1)** | 2025-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Data-analytic agents are emerging as a key catalyst for automated scientific discovery and for the vision of Innovating AI. Current approaches, however, rely heavily on prompt engineering over proprietary models, while open-source models struggle to face diverse-format, large-scale data files and long-horizon, multi-step reasoning that real-world analytics demands. This paper introduces DataMind, a scalable data synthesis and agent training recipe designed to build generalist data-analytic agents. DataMind tackles three key challenges in building open-source data-analytic agents, including insufficient data resources, improper training strategy, and unstable code-based multi-turn rollout. Concretely, DataMind applies 1) a fine-grained task taxonomy and a recursive easy-to-hard task composition mechanism to increase the diversity and difficulty of synthesized queries; 2) a knowledge-augmented trajectory sampling strategy followed by model-based and rule-based filtering; 3) a dynamically adjustable training objective combining both SFT and RL losses; 4) a memory-frugal and stable code-based multi-turn rollout framework. Built on DataMind, we curate DataMind-12K, a high-quality trajectory set spanning diverse domains, task categories, and data file formats for data-analytic tasks. Trained on DataMind-12K, our DataMind-14B achieves state-of-the-art with an average score of 71.16% on multiple data analysis benchmarks, outperforming the strongest proprietary baselines DeepSeek-V3.1 and GPT-5. Our DataMind-7B also performs best among all open-source models with a score of 68.10%. We also incorporate some empirical insights gained from our exploratory trials into the analysis experiments, aiming to provide actionable insights about agentic training for the community. We will release DataMind-12K and DataMind-7B,14B for the community's future research.</p></details> | Work in progress |

To tackle this problem, we propose GMS: Generalist Scanner Meets Specialist Locator, a synergistic coarse-to-fine framework that effectively improves GUI grounding performance. GMS leverages the complementary strengths of general vision-language models (VLMs) and small, task-specific GUI grounding models by assigning them distinct roles within the framework. Specifically, the general VLM acts as a 'Scanner' to identify potential regions of interest, while the fine-tuned grounding model serves as a 'Locator' that outputs precise coordinates within these regions. This design is inspired by how humans perform GUI grounding, where the eyes scan the interface and the brain focuses on interpretation and localization. Our whole framework consists of five stages and incorporates hierarchical search with cross-modal communication to achieve promising prediction results. Experimental results on the ScreenSpot-Pro dataset show that while the 'Scanner' and 'Locator' models achieve only $2.0\%$ and $3.7\%$ accuracy respectively when used independently, their integration within GMS framework yields an overall accuracy of $35.7\%$, representing a $10 \times$ improvement. Additionally, GMS significantly outperforms other strong baselines under various settings, demonstrating its robustness and potential for general-purpose GUI grounding.</p></details> |  |

We present LocoFormer, a generalist omni-bodied locomotion model that can control previously unseen legged and wheeled robots, even without precise knowledge of their kinematics. LocoFormer is able to adapt to changes in morphology and dynamics at test time. We find that two key choices enable adaptation. First, we train massive scale RL on procedurally generated robots with aggressive domain randomization. Second, in contrast to previous policies that are myopic with short context lengths, we extend context by orders of magnitude to span episode boundaries. We deploy the same LocoFormer to varied robots and show robust control even with large disturbances such as weight change and motor failures. In extreme scenarios, we see emergent adaptation across episodes, LocoFormer learns from falls in early episodes to improve control strategies in later ones. We believe that this simple, yet general recipe can be used to train foundation models for other robotic skills in the future.

Recently, the incentivization of reasoning capabilities in LLMs from RL indicates that $\textit{proper learning methods could enable effective inference-time scalability}$. A key challenge of RL is to obtain accurate reward signals for LLMs in various domains beyond verifiable questions or artificial rules. In this work, we investigate how to improve reward modeling (RM) with more inference compute for general queries, i.e. the $\textbf{inference-time scalability of generalist RM}$, and further, how to improve the effectiveness of performance-compute scaling with proper learning methods. For the RM approach, we adopt pointwise generative reward modeling (GRM) to enable flexibility for different input types and potential for inference-time scaling. For the learning method, we propose Self-Principled Critique Tuning (SPCT) to foster scalable reward generation behaviors in GRMs through online RL, to generate principles adaptively and critiques accurately, resulting in $\textbf{DeepSeek-GRM}$ models. Furthermore, for effective inference-time scaling, we use parallel sampling to expand compute usage, and introduce a meta RM to guide voting process for better scaling performance. Empirically, we show that SPCT significantly improves the quality and scalability of GRMs, outperforming existing methods and models in various RM benchmarks without severe biases, and could achieve better performance compared to training-time scaling. DeepSeek-GRM still meets challenges in some tasks, which we believe can be addressed by future efforts in generalist reward systems.

| **[Generalist Robot Manipulation beyond Action Labeled Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19958v1)** | 2025-09-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in generalist robot manipulation leverage pre-trained Vision-Language Models (VLMs) and large-scale robot demonstrations to tackle diverse tasks in a zero-shot manner. A key challenge remains: scaling high-quality, action-labeled robot demonstration data, which existing methods rely on for robustness and generalization. To address this, we propose a method that benefits from videos without action labels - featuring humans and/or robots in action - enhancing open-vocabulary performance and enabling data-efficient learning of new tasks. Our method extracts dense, dynamic 3D point clouds at the hand or gripper location and uses a proposed 3D dynamics predictor for self-supervision. This predictor is then tuned to an action predictor using a smaller labeled dataset for action alignment. We show that our method not only learns from unlabeled human and robot demonstrations - improving downstream generalist robot policies - but also enables robots to learn new tasks without action labels (i.e., out-of-action generalization) in both real-world and simulated settings.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at Conference on Robot Learning 2025</p></details> |
| **[Zero-Shot Multi-Spectral Learning: Reimagining a Generalist Multimodal Gemini 2.5 Model for Remote Sensing Applications](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19087v1)** | 2025-09-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-spectral imagery plays a crucial role in diverse Remote Sensing applications including land-use classification, environmental monitoring and urban planning. These images are widely adopted because their additional spectral bands correlate strongly with physical materials on the ground, such as ice, water, and vegetation. This allows for more accurate identification, and their public availability from missions, such as Sentinel-2 and Landsat, only adds to their value. Currently, the automatic analysis of such data is predominantly managed through machine learning models specifically trained for multi-spectral input, which are costly to train and support. Furthermore, although providing a lot of utility for Remote Sensing, such additional inputs cannot be used with powerful generalist large multimodal models, which are capable of solving many visual problems, but are not able to understand specialized multi-spectral signals. To address this, we propose a training-free approach which introduces new multi-spectral data in a Zero-Shot-only mode, as inputs to generalist multimodal models, trained on RGB-only inputs. Our approach leverages the multimodal models' understanding of the visual space, and proposes to adapt to inputs to that space, and to inject domain-specific information as instructions into the model. We exemplify this idea with the Gemini2.5 model and observe strong Zero-Shot performance gains of the approach on popular Remote Sensing benchmarks for land cover and land use classification and demonstrate the easy adaptability of Gemini2.5 to new inputs. These results highlight the potential for geospatial professionals, working with non-standard specialized inputs, to easily leverage powerful multimodal models, such as Gemini2.5, to accelerate their work, benefiting from their rich reasoning and contextual capabilities, grounded in the specialized sensor data.</p></details> |  |

Despite these successes, open-vocabulary autonomous drone navigation remains an unsolved challenge due to the scarcity of large-scale demonstrations, real-time control demands of drones for stabilization, and lack of reliable external pose estimation modules. In this work, we present SINGER for language-guided autonomous drone navigation in the open world using only onboard sensing and compute. To train robust, open-vocabulary navigation policies, SINGER leverages three central components: (i) a photorealistic language-embedded flight simulator with minimal sim-to-real gap using Gaussian Splatting for efficient data generation, (ii) an RRT-inspired multi-trajectory generation expert for collision-free navigation demonstrations, and these are used to train (iii) a lightweight end-to-end visuomotor policy for real-time closed-loop control. Through extensive hardware flight experiments, we demonstrate superior zero-shot sim-to-real transfer of our policy to unseen environments and unseen language-conditioned goal objects. When trained on ~700k-1M observation action pairs of language conditioned visuomotor data and deployed on hardware, SINGER outperforms a velocity-controlled semantic guidance baseline by reaching the query 23.33% more on average, and maintains the query in the field of view 16.67% more on average, with 10% fewer collisions.</p></details> |  |

Such methods often fail to scale, as every new problem or application requires time-consuming and iterative reward definition and tuning. We present Generalist Contact-Conditioned Policy (GeCCo) -- a low-level policy trained with Deep Reinforcement Learning that is capable of tracking arbitrary contact points on a quadruped robot. The strength of our approach is that it provides a general and modular low-level controller that can be reused for a wider range of high-level tasks, without the need to re-train new controllers from scratch. We demonstrate the scalability and robustness of our method by evaluating on a wide range of locomotion and manipulation tasks in a common framework and under a single generalist policy. These include a variety of gaits, traversing complex terrains (eg. stairs and slopes) as well as previously unseen stepping-stones and narrow beams, and interacting with objects (eg. pushing buttons, tracking trajectories). Our framework acquires new behaviors more efficiently, simply by combining a task-specific high-level contact planner and the pre-trained generalist policy.

Benchmarking and Strategic Insights](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17337v2)** | 2025-09-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision Language Models (VLMs) have shown promise in automating image diagnosis and interpretation in clinical settings. However, developing specialist medical VLMs requires substantial computational resources and carefully curated datasets, and it remains unclear under which conditions generalist and specialist medical VLMs each perform best. This study highlights the complementary strengths of specialist medical and generalist VLMs. Specialists remain valuable in modality-aligned use cases, but we find that efficiently fine-tuned generalist VLMs can achieve comparable or even superior performance in most tasks, particularly when transferring to unseen or rare OOD medical modalities. These results suggest that generalist VLMs, rather than being constrained by their lack of specialist medical pretraining, may offer a scalable and cost-effective pathway for advancing clinical AI development.</p></details> | version 2 |
| **[Kolb-Based Experiential Learning for Generalist Agents with Human-Level Kaggle Data Science Performance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03562v3)** | 2025-09-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Human expertise emerges through iterative cycles of interaction, reflection, and internal model updating, which are central to cognitive theories such as Kolb's experiential learning and Vygotsky's zone of proximal development. In contrast, current AI systems, particularly LLM agents, rely on static pre-training or rigid workflows, lacking mechanisms for continual adaptation. Recent studies identified early cognitive traits in LLM agents (reflection, revision, and self-correction) suggesting foundational elements of human-like experiential learning. Thus the key question: Can we design LLM agents capable of structured, cognitively grounded learning similar to human processes? In response, we propose a computational framework of Kolb's learning cycle with Vygotsky's ZPD for autonomous agents. Our architecture separates extrinsic (environment interaction) and intrinsic (internal reflection/abstraction) functions, enabling cognitively grounded scaffolded learning, where the agent initially learns within structured environments, followed by open-ended generalisation. This approach empowers agents to master complex tasks ; domains that traditional fine-tuning or simple reflective methods could not tackle effectively. Its potential is powerfully demonstrated via direct comparison with humans in real-world Kaggle data science competitions. Learning fully automated data science code generation across 81 tasks, our system, Agent K, demonstrated the ability to perform the entire workflow autonomously, achieving an Elo-MMR score of 1694, beyond median score of the Kaggle Masters (the top 2% among 200,000 users) of our study. With 9 gold, 8 silver, and 12 bronze medals level performance - including 4 gold and 4 silver on prize-awarding competitions - Agent K is the 1st AI system to successfully integrate Kolb- and Vygotsky-inspired human cognitive learning, marking a major step toward generalist AI.</p></details> |  |

However, executing such manoeuvres requires precise temporal coordination and complex agent-environment interactions. Moreover, legged locomotion is inherently more prone to slippage and tripping, and the classical approach of modeling such cases to design a robust controller thus quickly becomes impractical. In contrast, reinforcement learning offers a compelling solution by enabling optimal control through trial and error. We present a generalist reinforcement learning algorithm for quadrupedal agents in dynamic motion scenarios. The learned policy rivals state-of-the-art specialist policies trained using a mixture of experts approach, while using only 25% as many agents during training. Our experiments also highlight the key components of the generalist locomotion policy and the primary factors contributing to its success.</p></details> | <details><summary>Suppl...</summary><p>Supplementary material can be found here: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/18h25azbCFfPF4fhSsRfxKrnZo3dPKs_j?usp=sharing</p></details> |
| **[Dita: Scaling Diffusion Transformer for Generalist Vision-Language-Action Policy](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19757v2)** | 2025-09-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While recent vision-language-action models trained on diverse robot datasets exhibit promising generalization capabilities with limited in-domain data, their reliance on compact action heads to predict discretized or continuous actions constrains adaptability to heterogeneous action spaces. We present Dita, a scalable framework that leverages Transformer architectures to directly denoise continuous action sequences through a unified multimodal diffusion process. Departing from prior methods that condition denoising on fused embeddings via shallow networks, Dita employs in-context conditioning -- enabling fine-grained alignment between denoised actions and raw visual tokens from historical observations. This design explicitly models action deltas and environmental nuances. By scaling the diffusion action denoiser alongside the Transformer's scalability, Dita effectively integrates cross-embodiment datasets across diverse camera perspectives, observation scenes, tasks, and action spaces. Such synergy enhances robustness against various variances and facilitates the successful execution of long-horizon tasks. Evaluations across extensive benchmarks demonstrate state-of-the-art or comparative performance in simulation. Notably, Dita achieves robust real-world adaptation to environmental variances and complex long-horizon tasks through 10-shot finetuning, using only third-person camera inputs. The architecture establishes a versatile, lightweight and open-source baseline for generalist robot policy learning.

Despite recent advancements that have enabled the creation of autonomous software agents utilizing LLMs for end-to-end development tasks, these systems are typically designed for specific SE functions. We introduce HyperAgent, an innovative generalist multi-agent system designed to tackle a wide range of SE tasks across different programming languages by mimicking the workflows of human developers. HyperAgent features four specialized agents-Planner, Navigator, Code Editor, and Executor-capable of handling the entire lifecycle of SE tasks, from initial planning to final verification. HyperAgent sets new benchmarks in diverse SE tasks, including GitHub issue resolution on the renowned SWE-Bench benchmark, outperforming robust baselines. Furthermore, HyperAgent demonstrates exceptional performance in repository-level code generation (RepoExec) and fault localization and program repair (Defects4J), often surpassing state-of-the-art baselines.</p></details> | 49 pages |
| **[Generalist versus Specialist Vision Foundation Models for Ocular Disease and Oculomics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03421v1)** | 2025-09-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Medical foundation models, pre-trained with large-scale clinical data, demonstrate strong performance in diverse clinically relevant applications. RETFound, trained on nearly one million retinal images, exemplifies this approach in applications with retinal images. However, the emergence of increasingly powerful and multifold larger generalist foundation models such as DINOv2 and DINOv3 raises the question of whether domain-specific pre-training remains essential, and if so, what gap persists. To investigate this, we systematically evaluated the adaptability of DINOv2 and DINOv3 in retinal image applications, compared to two specialist RETFound models, RETFound-MAE and RETFound-DINOv2. We assessed performance on ocular disease detection and systemic disease prediction using two adaptation strategies: fine-tuning and linear probing. Data efficiency and adaptation efficiency were further analysed to characterise trade-offs between predictive performance and computational cost. Our results show that although scaling generalist models yields strong adaptability across diverse tasks, RETFound-DINOv2 consistently outperforms these generalist foundation models in ocular-disease detection and oculomics tasks, demonstrating stronger generalisability and data efficiency. These findings suggest that specialist retinal foundation models remain the most effective choice for clinical applications, while the narrowing gap with generalist foundation models suggests that continued data and model scaling can deliver domain-relevant gains and position them as strong foundations for future medical foundation models.</p></details> | 39 pages, 8 Figures |
| **[OmniActor: A Generalist GUI and Embodied Agent for 2D&3D Worlds](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02322v1)** | 2025-09-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal large language models are evolving toward multimodal agents capable of proactively executing tasks. Most agent research focuses on GUI or embodied scenarios, which correspond to agents interacting with 2D virtual worlds or 3D real worlds, respectively. However, many complex tasks typically require agents to interleavely interact with these two types of environment. We initially mix GUI and embodied data to train, but find the performance degeneration brought by the data conflict. Further analysis reveals that GUI and embodied data exhibit synergy and conflict at the shallow and deep layers, respectively, which resembles the cerebrum-cerebellum mechanism in the human brain. To this end, we propose a high-performance generalist agent OmniActor, designed from both structural and data perspectives. First, we propose Layer-heterogeneity MoE to eliminate the conflict between GUI and embodied data by separating deep-layer parameters, while leverage their synergy by sharing shallow-layer parameters. By successfully leveraging the synergy and eliminating the conflict, OmniActor outperforms agents only trained by GUI or embodied data in GUI or embodied tasks. Furthermore, we unify the action spaces of GUI and embodied tasks, and collect large-scale GUI and embodied data from various sources for training. This significantly improves OmniActor under different scenarios, especially in GUI tasks. The code will be publicly available.</p></details> |  |
| **[From Experts to a Generalist: Toward General Whole-Body Control for Humanoid Robots](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12779v3)** | 2025-09-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Achieving general agile whole-body control on humanoid robots remains a major challenge due to diverse motion demands and data conflicts. While existing frameworks excel in training single motion-specific policies, they struggle to generalize across highly varied behaviors due to conflicting control requirements and mismatched data distributions. In this work, we propose BumbleBee (BB), an expert-generalist learning framework that combines motion clustering and sim-to-real adaptation to overcome these challenges. BB first leverages an autoencoder-based clustering method to group behaviorally similar motions using motion features and motion descriptions. Expert policies are then trained within each cluster and refined with real-world data through iterative delta action modeling to bridge the sim-to-real gap. Finally, these experts are distilled into a unified generalist controller that preserves agility and robustness across all motion types. Experiments on two simulations and a real humanoid robot demonstrate that BB achieves state-of-the-art general whole-body control, setting a new benchmark for agile, robust, and generalizable humanoid performance in the real world.

However, the exploration of versatile EEG models is constrained by diverse data formats, outdated pre-training paradigms, and limited transfer learning methods, only leading to specialist models on single dataset. In this paper, we introduce EEGPT, the first generalist EEG foundation model designed to address these challenges. First, we propose an electrode-wise modeling strategy that treats each electrode as a fundamental unit, enabling the integration of diverse EEG datasets collected from up to 138 electrodes, amassing 37.5M pre-training samples. Second, we develop the first autoregressive EEG pre-trained model, moving away from traditional masked autoencoder approaches to a next signal prediction task that better captures the sequential and temporal dependencies of EEG data. We also explore scaling laws with model up to 1.1B parameters: the largest in EEG research to date. Third, we introduce a multi-task transfer learning paradigm using a learnable electrode graph network shared across tasks, which for the first time confirms multi-task compatibility and synergy. As the first generalist EEG foundation model, EEGPT shows broad compatibility with various signal acquisition devices, subjects, and tasks. It supports up to 138 electrodes and any combination thereof as input. Furthermore, we simultaneously evaluate it on 5 distinct tasks across 12 benchmarks. EEGPT consistently outperforms existing specialist models across all downstream tasks, with its effectiveness further validated through extensive ablation studies. This work sets a new direction for generalist EEG modeling, offering improved scalability, transferability, and adaptability for a wide range of EEG applications.

To address these challenges, we introduce CLARIFY, a Specialist-Generalist framework for dermatological visual question answering (VQA). CLARIFY combines two components: (i) a lightweight, domain-trained image classifier (the Specialist) that provides fast and highly accurate diagnostic predictions, and (ii) a powerful yet compressed conversational VLM (the Generalist) that generates natural language explanations to user queries. In our framework, the Specialist's predictions directly guide the Generalist's reasoning, focusing it on the correct diagnostic path. This synergy is further enhanced by a knowledge graph-based retrieval module, which grounds the Generalist's responses in factual dermatological knowledge, ensuring both accuracy and reliability. This hierarchical design not only reduces diagnostic errors but also significantly improves computational efficiency. Experiments on our curated multimodal dermatology dataset demonstrate that CLARIFY achieves an 18\% improvement in diagnostic accuracy over the strongest baseline, a fine-tuned, uncompressed single-line VLM, while reducing the average VRAM requirement and latency by at least 20\% and 5\%, respectively. These results indicate that a Specialist-Generalist system provides a practical and powerful paradigm for building lightweight, trustworthy, and clinically viable AI systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 8 figures, Prepared for submission to IEEE Transactions on Human-Machine Systems</p></details> |

Recent machine learning breakthroughs have heralded policies that master individual skills like reaching, object manipulation and locomotion in musculoskeletal systems with many degrees of freedom. However, these agents are merely "specialists", achieving high performance for a single skill. In this work, we develop Arnold, a generalist policy that masters multiple tasks and embodiments. Arnold combines behavior cloning and fine-tuning with PPO to achieve expert or super-expert performance in 14 challenging control tasks from dexterous object manipulation to locomotion. A key innovation is Arnold's sensorimotor vocabulary, a compositional representation of the semantics of heterogeneous sensory modalities, objectives, and actuators. Arnold leverages this vocabulary via a transformer architecture to deal with the variable observation and action spaces of each task. This framework supports efficient multi-task, multi-embodiment learning and facilitates rapid adaptation to novel tasks. Finally, we analyze Arnold to provide insights into biological motor control, corroborating recent findings on the limited transferability of muscle synergies across tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>A.S.C...</summary><p>A.S.C. and B.A. contributed equally.

While deep learning has achieved progress in individual tasks, existing approaches are often anatomy- or application-specific and lack generalizability across diverse clinical settings. Moreover, current pipelines rarely integrate imaging data with complementary language information that radiologists rely on in routine practice. Here, we introduce OmniMRI, a unified vision-language foundation model designed to generalize across the entire MRI workflow. OmniMRI is trained on a large-scale, heterogeneous corpus curated from 60 public datasets, over 220,000 MRI volumes and 19 million MRI slices, incorporating image-only data, paired vision-text data, and instruction-response data. Its multi-stage training paradigm, comprising self-supervised vision pretraining, vision-language alignment, multimodal pretraining, and multi-task instruction tuning, progressively equips the model with transferable visual representations, cross-modal reasoning, and robust instruction-following capabilities. Qualitative results demonstrate OmniMRI's ability to perform diverse tasks within a single architecture, including MRI reconstruction, anatomical and pathological segmentation, abnormality detection, diagnostic suggestion, and radiology report generation. These findings highlight OmniMRI's potential to consolidate fragmented pipelines into a scalable, generalist framework, paving the way toward foundation models that unify imaging and clinical language for comprehensive, end-to-end MRI interpretation.</p></details> |  |

While it is possible for humans to manually create immersive and interactive worlds through 3D graphics, as seen in applications such as VR, gaming, and robotics, this process remains highly labor-intensive. In this paper, we propose a scalable method for generating high-quality 3D environments that can serve as training data for foundation models. We recast 3D environment building as a sequential decision-making problem, employing Vision-Language-Models (VLMs) as policies that output actions to jointly craft a 3D environment's layout, materials, lighting, and assets. Our proposed framework, 3D-Generalist, trains VLMs to generate more prompt-aligned 3D environments via self-improvement fine-tuning. We demonstrate the effectiveness of 3D-Generalist and the proposed training strategy in generating simulation-ready 3D environments. Furthermore, we demonstrate its quality and scalability in synthetic data generation by pretraining a vision foundation model on the generated data. After fine-tuning the pre-trained model on downstream tasks, we show that it surpasses models pre-trained on meticulously human-crafted synthetic data and approaches results achieved with real data orders of magnitude larger.</p></details> | <details><summary>proje...</summary><p>project website: https://ai.stanford.edu/~sunfanyun/3d-generalist/</p></details> |
| **[Shortcut Learning in Generalist Robot Policies: The Role of Dataset Diversity and Fragmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06426v1)** | 2025-08-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generalist robot policies trained on large-scale datasets such as Open X-Embodiment (OXE) demonstrate strong performance across a wide range of tasks. However, they often struggle to generalize beyond the distribution of their training data. In this paper, we investigate the underlying cause of this limited generalization capability. We identify shortcut learning -- the reliance on task-irrelevant features -- as a key impediment to generalization. Through comprehensive theoretical and empirical analysis, we uncover two primary contributors to shortcut learning: (1) limited diversity within individual sub-datasets, and (2) significant distributional disparities across sub-datasets, leading to dataset fragmentation. These issues arise from the inherent structure of large-scale datasets like OXE, which are typically composed of multiple sub-datasets collected independently across varied environments and embodiments. Our findings provide critical insights into dataset collection strategies that can reduce shortcut learning and enhance the generalization ability of generalist robot policies. Moreover, in scenarios where acquiring new large-scale data is impractical, we demonstrate that carefully selected robotic data augmentation strategies can effectively reduce shortcut learning in existing offline datasets, thereby improving generalization capabilities of generalist robot policies, e.g., $π_0$, in both simulation and real-world environments.

Recently, generalist graph anomaly detection (GAD) models have shown promising results. They are pretrained on multiple source datasets and generalize across domains. While effective on static graphs, they struggle to capture evolving anomalies in dynamic graphs. Moreover, the continuous emergence of new domains and the lack of labeled data further challenge generalist DGAD. Effective cross-domain DGAD requires both domain-specific and domain-agnostic anomalous patterns. Importantly, these patterns evolve temporally within and across domains. Building on these insights, we propose a DGAD model with Dynamic Prototypes (DP) to capture evolving domain-specific and domain-agnostic patterns. Firstly, DP-DGAD extracts dynamic prototypes, i.e., evolving representations of normal and anomalous patterns, from temporal ego-graphs and stores them in a memory buffer. The buffer is selectively updated to retain general, domain-agnostic patterns while incorporating new domain-specific ones. Then, an anomaly scorer compares incoming data with dynamic prototypes to flag both general and domain-specific anomalies. Finally, DP-DGAD employs confidence-based pseudo-labeling for effective self-supervised adaptation in target domains. Extensive experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art performance across ten real-world datasets from different domains.</p></details> |  |

Despite their effectiveness in broad applications, generalist models are primarily trained on web-scale datasets dominated by natural images, resulting in the sacrifice of specialized capabilities for domain-specific tasks that require extensive domain prior knowledge. Moreover, directly integrating expert models tailored for specific domains is challenging due to the representational gap and imbalanced optimization between the generalist model and experts. To address these challenges, we introduce Chimera, a scalable and low-cost multi-modal pipeline designed to boost the ability of existing LMMs with domain-specific experts.

However, existing molecular generative models can only tackle some of these tasks. We present Generalist Molecular generative model (GenMol), a versatile framework that uses only a single discrete diffusion model to handle diverse drug discovery scenarios. GenMol generates Sequential Attachment-based Fragment Embedding (SAFE) sequences through non-autoregressive bidirectional parallel decoding, thereby allowing the utilization of a molecular context that does not rely on the specific token ordering while having better sampling efficiency. GenMol uses fragments as basic building blocks for molecules and introduces fragment remasking, a strategy that optimizes molecules by regenerating masked fragments, enabling effective exploration of chemical space. We further propose molecular context guidance (MCG), a guidance method tailored for masked discrete diffusion of GenMol. GenMol significantly outperforms the previous GPT-based model in de novo generation and fragment-constrained generation, and achieves state-of-the-art performance in goal-directed hit generation and lead optimization. These results demonstrate that GenMol can tackle a wide range of drug discovery tasks, providing a unified and versatile approach for molecular design.

In this paper, we identify a strong correlation between a vision model's perceptual ability and its generalist forecasting performance over short time horizons. This trend holds across a diverse set of pretrained models-including those trained generatively-and across multiple levels of abstraction, from raw pixels to depth, point tracks, and object motion. The result is made possible by a novel generalist forecasting framework that operates on any frozen vision backbone: we train latent diffusion models to forecast future features in the frozen representation space, which are then decoded via lightweight, task-specific readouts. To enable consistent evaluation across tasks, we introduce distributional metrics that compare distributional properties directly in the space of downstream tasks and apply this framework to nine models and four tasks. Our results highlight the value of bridging representation learning and generative modeling for temporally grounded video understanding.</p></details> |  |

However, current judge models suffer from narrow specialization and limited robustness, undermining their capacity for comprehensive evaluations. In this work, we present CompassJudger-2, a novel generalist judge model that overcomes these limitations via a task-driven, multi-domain data curation strategy. Central to our approach is supervising judgment tasks with verifiable rewards, guiding intrinsic critical reasoning through rejection sampling to foster robust, generalizable judgment capabilities. We introduce a refined learning objective with margin policy gradient loss to enhance performance. Empirically, CompassJudger-2 achieves superior results across multiple judge and reward benchmarks, and our 7B model demonstrates competitive judgment accuracy with significantly larger models like DeepSeek-V3 and Qwen3-235B-A22B. Additionally, we propose JudgerBenchV2, a comprehensive benchmark evaluating cross-domain judgment accuracy and rank consistency to standardize judge model evaluation.

| **[Do We Really Need Specialization? Evaluating Generalist Text Embeddings for Zero-Shot Recommendation and Search](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05006v2)** | 2025-07-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Pre-trained language models (PLMs) are widely used to derive semantic representations from item metadata in recommendation and search. In sequential recommendation, PLMs enhance ID-based embeddings through textual metadata, while in product search, they align item characteristics with user intent. Recent studies suggest task and domain-specific fine-tuning are needed to improve representational power. This paper challenges this assumption, showing that Generalist Text Embedding Models (GTEs), pre-trained on large-scale corpora, can guarantee strong zero-shot performance without specialized adaptation. Our experiments demonstrate that GTEs outperform traditional and fine-tuned models in both sequential recommendation and product search. We attribute this to a superior representational power, as they distribute features more evenly across the embedding space. Finally, we show that compressing embedding dimensions by focusing on the most informative directions (e.g., via PCA) effectively reduces noise and improves the performance of specialized models. To ensure reproducibility, we provide our repository at https://split.to/gte4ps.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accept as Short Paper at RecSys 2025</p></details> |
| **[The Generalist Brain Module: Module Repetition in Neural Networks in Light of the Minicolumn Hypothesis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12473v1)** | 2025-07-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While modern AI continues to advance, the biological brain remains the pinnacle of neural networks in its robustness, adaptability, and efficiency. This review explores an AI architectural path inspired by the brain's structure, particularly the minicolumn hypothesis, which views the neocortex as a distributed system of repeated modules - a structure we connect to collective intelligence (CI). Despite existing work, there is a lack of comprehensive reviews connecting the cortical column to the architectures of repeated neural modules. This review aims to fill that gap by synthesizing historical, theoretical, and methodological perspectives on neural module repetition. We distinguish between architectural repetition - reusing structure - and parameter-shared module repetition, where the same functional unit is repeated across a network. The latter exhibits key CI properties such as robustness, adaptability, and generalization. Evidence suggests that the repeated module tends to converge toward a generalist module: simple, flexible problem solvers capable of handling many roles in the ensemble. This generalist tendency may offer solutions to longstanding challenges in modern AI: improved energy efficiency during training through simplicity and scalability, and robust embodied control via generalization. While empirical results suggest such systems can generalize to out-of-distribution problems, theoretical results are still lacking. Overall, architectures featuring module repetition remain an emerging and unexplored architectural strategy, with significant untapped potential for both efficiency, robustness, and adaptiveness. We believe that a system that adopts the benefits of CI, while adhering to architectural and functional principles of the minicolumns, could challenge the modern AI problems of scalability, energy consumption, and democratization.</p></details> |  |
| **[Generalist Reward Models: Found Inside Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23235v1)** | 2025-06-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The alignment of Large Language Models (LLMs) is critically dependent on reward models trained on costly human preference data. While recent work explores bypassing this cost with AI feedback, these methods often lack a rigorous theoretical foundation. In this paper, we discover that a powerful generalist reward model is already latently present within any LLM trained via standard next-token prediction. We prove that this endogenous reward is not a heuristic, but is theoretically equivalent to a reward function learned through offline inverse reinforcement learning. This connection allows us to directly elicit a high-quality reward signal from a base (pre-trained or supervised fine-tuned) model without any further training. Critically, we also prove that subsequent reinforcement learning using this endogenous reward leads to a policy with a provably superior error bound compared to the base model. To our best knowledge, this is the first theoretical proof of the effectiveness of reinforcement learning for LLMs. Our experiments validate this theory, demonstrating that our method not only outperforms existing LLM-as-a-judge approaches but can also surpass explicitly trained reward models. These findings suggest that the reward modeling stage can be replaced by a principled method of eliciting the knowledge already captured during pre-training, heralding a more efficient, powerful, and scalable paradigm for LLMs alignment as well as multi-modal models.</p></details> |  |
| **[Unifying Biomedical Vision-Language Expertise: Towards a Generalist Foundation Model via Multi-CLIP Knowledge Distillation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22567v1)** | 2025-06-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>CLIP models pretrained on natural images with billion-scale image-text pairs have demonstrated impressive capabilities in zero-shot classification, cross-modal retrieval, and open-ended visual answering. However, transferring this success to biomedicine is hindered by the scarcity of large-scale biomedical image-text corpora, the heterogeneity of image modalities, and fragmented data standards across institutions. These limitations hinder the development of a unified and generalizable biomedical foundation model trained from scratch. To overcome this, we introduce MMKD-CLIP, a generalist biomedical foundation model developed via Multiple Medical CLIP Knowledge Distillation. Rather than relying on billion-scale raw data, MMKD-CLIP distills knowledge from nine state-of-the-art domain-specific or generalist biomedical CLIP models, each pretrained on millions of biomedical image-text pairs. Our two-stage training pipeline first performs CLIP-style pretraining on over 2.9 million biomedical image-text pairs from 26 image modalities, followed by feature-level distillation using over 19.2 million feature pairs extracted from teacher models. We evaluate MMKD-CLIP on 58 diverse biomedical datasets, encompassing over 10.8 million biomedical images across nine image modalities. The evaluation spans six core task types: zero-shot classification, linear probing, cross-modal retrieval, visual question answering, survival prediction, and cancer diagnosis. MMKD-CLIP consistently outperforms all teacher models while demonstrating remarkable robustness and generalization across image domains and task settings. These results underscore that multi-teacher knowledge distillation is a scalable and effective paradigm for building high-performing biomedical foundation models under the practical constraints of real-world data availability.</p></details> |  |
| **[Med-LEGO: Editing and Adapting toward Generalist Medical Image Diagnosis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01164v2)** | 2025-06-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The adoption of visual foundation models has become a common practice in computer-aided diagnosis (CAD). While these foundation models provide a viable solution for creating generalist medical AI, privacy concerns make it difficult to pre-train or continuously update such models across multiple domains and datasets, leading many studies to focus on specialist models. To address this challenge, we propose Med-LEGO, a training-free framework that enables the seamless integration or updating of a generalist CAD model by combining multiple specialist models, similar to assembling LEGO bricks. Med-LEGO enhances LoRA (low-rank adaptation) by incorporating singular value decomposition (SVD) to efficiently capture the domain expertise of each specialist model with minimal additional parameters. By combining these adapted weights through simple operations, Med-LEGO allows for the easy integration or modification of specific diagnostic capabilities without the need for original data or retraining. Finally, the combined model can be further adapted to new diagnostic tasks, making it a versatile generalist model. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that Med-LEGO outperforms existing methods in both cross-domain and in-domain medical tasks while using only 0.18% of full model parameters. These merged models show better convergence and generalization to new tasks, providing an effective path toward generalist medical AI.</p></details> | <details><summary>Medic...</summary><p>Medical Image Computing and Computer Assisted Intervention (MICCAI) 2025</p></details> |

However, current training paradigms face critical limitations, including reliance on outcome supervision and labor-intensive human annotations. To address these challenges, we propose Similar, a Step-Wise Multi-Dimensional Generalist Reward Model, which offers fine-grained signals for agent training and can choose better action for inference-time scaling. Specifically, we begin by systematically defining five dimensions for evaluating agent actions. Building on this framework, we design an MCTS-P algorithm to automatically collect and annotate step-wise, five-dimensional agent execution data. Using this data, we train Similar with the Triple-M strategy. Furthermore, we introduce the first benchmark in the virtual agent domain for step-wise, multi-dimensional reward model training and evaluation, named SRM. This benchmark consists of two components: SRMTrain, which serves as the training set for Similar, and SRMEval, a manually selected test set for evaluating the reward model. Experimental results demonstrate that Similar, through its step-wise, multi-dimensional assessment and synergistic gain, provides GVAs with effective intermediate signals during both training and inference-time scaling.

| **[AgentSynth: Scalable Task Generation for Generalist Computer-Use Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14205v1)** | 2025-06-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce AgentSynth, a scalable and cost-efficient pipeline for automatically synthesizing high-quality tasks and trajectory datasets for generalist computer-use agents. Leveraging information asymmetry, AgentSynth constructs subtasks that are simple during generation but significantly more challenging when composed into long-horizon tasks, enabling the creation of over 6,000 diverse and realistic tasks. Our pipeline begins with an LLM-based task proposer guided by a persona, followed by an execution agent that completes the task and logs the trajectory. This process is repeated iteratively to form a sequence of subtasks, which are then summarized by a separate agent into a composite task of controllable difficulty. A key strength of AgentSynth is its ability to precisely modulate task complexity by varying the number of subtasks. Empirical evaluations show that state-of-the-art LLM agents suffer a steep performance drop, from 18% success at difficulty level 1 to just 4% at level 6, highlighting the benchmark's difficulty and discriminative power. Moreover, our pipeline achieves a low average cost of \$0.60 per trajectory, orders of magnitude cheaper than human annotations. Our code and data are publicly available at https://github.com/sunblaze-ucb/AgentSynth</p></details> |  |

The introduction of Segment Anything Model (SAM) set a milestone on segmentation of natural images, inspiring the design of a multitude of architectures for medical image segmentation. In this survey we offer a comprehensive and in-depth investigation on generalist models for medical image segmentation.

However, building a generalist agent with capabilities such as perception, planning, action, grounding, and reflection in open-world environments like Minecraft remains challenges: insufficient domain-specific data, interference among heterogeneous tasks, and visual diversity in open-world settings. In this paper, we address these challenges through three key contributions. 1) We propose a knowledge-enhanced data generation pipeline to provide scalable and high-quality training data for agent development. 2) To mitigate interference among heterogeneous tasks, we introduce a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture with task-level routing. 3) We develop a Multimodal Reasoning-Augmented Reinforcement Learning approach to enhance the agent's reasoning ability for visual diversity in Minecraft. Built upon these innovations, we present Optimus-3, a general-purpose agent for Minecraft. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that Optimus-3 surpasses both generalist multimodal large language models and existing state-of-the-art agents across a wide range of tasks in the Minecraft environment.

The generalist model is a general framework trained with massive data and is able to process various downstream tasks simultaneously. Encouraged by their impressive performance, an increasing number of researchers are venturing into the realm of applying these models to computer vision tasks. However, the inputs and outputs of vision tasks are more diverse, and it is difficult to summarize them as a unified representation. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive overview of the vision generalist models, delving into their characteristics and capabilities within the field. First, we review the background, including the datasets, tasks, and benchmarks. Then, we dig into the design of frameworks that have been proposed in existing research, while also introducing the techniques employed to enhance their performance. To better help the researchers comprehend the area, we take a brief excursion into related domains, shedding light on their interconnections and potential synergies. To conclude, we provide some real-world application scenarios, undertake a thorough examination of the persistent challenges, and offer insights into possible directions for future research endeavors.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by International Journal of Computer Vision (IJCV)</p></details> |
| **[OctoNav: Towards Generalist Embodied Navigation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09839v1)** | 2025-06-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Embodied navigation stands as a foundation pillar within the broader pursuit of embodied AI. However, previous navigation research is divided into different tasks/capabilities, e.g., ObjNav, ImgNav and VLN, where they differ in task objectives and modalities, making datasets and methods are designed individually. In this work, we take steps toward generalist navigation agents, which can follow free-form instructions that include arbitrary compounds of multi-modal and multi-capability. To achieve this, we propose a large-scale benchmark and corresponding method, termed OctoNav-Bench and OctoNav-R1. Specifically, OctoNav-Bench features continuous environments and is constructed via a designed annotation pipeline. We thoroughly craft instruction-trajectory pairs, where instructions are diverse in free-form with arbitrary modality and capability. Also, we construct a Think-Before-Action (TBA-CoT) dataset within OctoNav-Bench to provide the thinking process behind actions. For OctoNav-R1, we build it upon MLLMs and adapt it to a VLA-type model, which can produce low-level actions solely based on 2D visual observations. Moreover, we design a Hybrid Training Paradigm (HTP) that consists of three stages, i.e., Action-/TBA-SFT, Nav-GPRO, and Online RL stages. Each stage contains specifically designed learning policies and rewards. Importantly, for TBA-SFT and Nav-GRPO designs, we are inspired by the OpenAI-o1 and DeepSeek-R1, which show impressive reasoning ability via thinking-before-answer. Thus, we aim to investigate how to achieve thinking-before-action in the embodied navigation field, to improve model's reasoning ability toward generalists. Specifically, we propose TBA-SFT to utilize the TBA-CoT dataset to fine-tune the model as a cold-start phrase and then leverage Nav-GPRO to improve its thinking ability. Finally, OctoNav-R1 shows superior performance compared with previous methods.</p></details> | 31 pages, 25 figures |

We present MedVersa, a generalist foundation model trained on tens of millions of compiled medical instances. MedVersa unlocks generalist learning from multimodal inputs and outputs, representing the first example of a generalist model reaching competitive performance with leading specialized solutions across a variety of medical imaging scenarios. MedVersa achieves state-of-the-art performance in nine tasks, sometimes outperforming counterparts by over 10%. Radiologist evaluation shows MedVersa-generated reports get superior performance in 95% of normal studies, while matching or exceeding human reports in 71% of cases overall. User studies showed notable reductions in report writing time and discrepancies with the use of MedVersa. Our findings underscore the value of flexible, multimodal AI systems in advancing medical image interpretation and supporting clinical expertise.</p></details> | Technical study |

To achieve it, we propose the RAPID Hand, a co-optimized hardware and software platform where the compact 20-DoF hand, robust whole-hand perception, and high-DoF teleoperation interface are jointly designed. Specifically, RAPID Hand adopts a compact and practical hand ontology and a hardware-level perception framework that stably integrates wrist-mounted vision, fingertip tactile sensing, and proprioception with sub-7 ms latency and spatial alignment. Collecting high-quality demonstrations on high-DoF hands is challenging, as existing teleoperation methods struggle with precision and stability on complex multi-fingered systems. We address this by co-optimizing hand design, perception integration, and teleoperation interface through a universal actuation scheme, custom perception electronics, and two retargeting constraints. We evaluate the platform's hardware, perception, and teleoperation interface. Training a diffusion policy on collected data shows superior performance over prior works, validating the system's capability for reliable, high-quality data collection. The platform is constructed from low-cost and off-the-shelf components and will be made public to ensure reproducibility and ease of adoption.</p></details> |  |
| **[Modality-Specialized Synergizers for Interleaved Vision-Language Generalists](https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03604v2)** | 2025-06-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have led to the emergence of Vision-Language Generalists (VLGs) capable of understanding and generating both text and images. However, seamlessly generating an arbitrary sequence of text and images remains a challenging task for the current VLGs. One primary limitation lies in applying a unified architecture and the same set of parameters to simultaneously model discrete text tokens and continuous image features. Recent works attempt to tackle this fundamental problem by introducing modality-aware expert models. However, they employ identical architectures to process both text and images, disregarding the intrinsic inductive biases in these two modalities. In this work, we introduce MODALITY-SPECIALIZED SYNERGIZERS (MOSS), a novel design that efficiently optimizes existing unified architectures of VLGs with modality-specialized adaptation layers, i.e., a Convolutional LoRA for modeling the local priors of image patches and a Linear LoRA for processing sequential text. This design enables more effective modeling of modality-specific features while maintaining the strong cross-modal integration gained from pretraining. In addition, to improve the instruction-following capability on interleaved text-and-image generation, we introduce LEAFINSTRUCT, the first open-sourced interleaved instruction tuning dataset comprising 184,982 high-quality instances on more than 10 diverse domains. Extensive experiments show that VLGs integrated with M OSS achieve state-of-the-art performance, significantly surpassing baseline VLGs in complex interleaved generation tasks. Furthermore, our method exhibits strong generalizability on different VLGs.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 Pag...</summary><p>8 Pages, interleaved instruction tuning, parameter-efficient tuning, image understanding, image generation</p></details> |
| **[Zero-shot Generalist Graph Anomaly Detection with Unified Neighborhood Prompts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14886v2)** | 2025-06-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph anomaly detection (GAD), which aims to identify nodes in a graph that significantly deviate from normal patterns, plays a crucial role in broad application domains. However, existing GAD methods are one-model-for-one-dataset approaches, i.e., training a separate model for each graph dataset. This largely limits their applicability in real-world scenarios. To overcome this limitation, we propose a novel zero-shot generalist GAD approach UNPrompt that trains a one-for-all detection model, requiring the training of one GAD model on a single graph dataset and then effectively generalizing to detect anomalies in other graph datasets without any retraining or fine-tuning. The key insight in UNPrompt is that i) the predictability of latent node attributes can serve as a generalized anomaly measure and ii) generalized normal and abnormal graph patterns can be learned via latent node attribute prediction in a properly normalized node attribute space. UNPrompt achieves a generalist mode for GAD through two main modules: one module aligns the dimensionality and semantics of node attributes across different graphs via coordinate-wise normalization, while another module learns generalized neighborhood prompts that support the use of latent node attribute predictability as an anomaly score across different datasets. Extensive experiments on real-world GAD datasets show that UNPrompt significantly outperforms diverse competing methods under the generalist GAD setting, and it also has strong superiority under the one-model-for-one-dataset setting.

In this work, we introduce visual trace prompting, a simple yet effective approach to facilitate VLA models' spatial-temporal awareness for action prediction by encoding state-action trajectories visually. We develop a new TraceVLA model by finetuning OpenVLA on our own collected dataset of 150K robot manipulation trajectories using visual trace prompting. Evaluations of TraceVLA across 137 configurations in SimplerEnv and 4 tasks on a physical WidowX robot demonstrate state-of-the-art performance, outperforming OpenVLA by 10% on SimplerEnv and 3.5x on real-robot tasks and exhibiting robust generalization across diverse embodiments and scenarios. To further validate the effectiveness and generality of our method, we present a compact VLA model based on 4B Phi-3-Vision, pretrained on the Open-X-Embodiment and finetuned on our dataset, rivals the 7B OpenVLA baseline while significantly improving inference efficiency.</p></details> |  |

Unlike prior efforts that rely heavily on template based queries, ReXVQA introduces a diverse and clinically authentic task suite reflecting five core radiological reasoning skills: presence assessment, location analysis, negation detection, differential diagnosis, and geometric reasoning. We evaluate eight state-of-the-art multimodal large language models, including MedGemma-4B-it, Qwen2.5-VL, Janus-Pro-7B, and Eagle2-9B. The best-performing model (MedGemma) achieves 83.24% overall accuracy. To bridge the gap between AI performance and clinical expertise, we conducted a comprehensive human reader study involving 3 radiology residents on 200 randomly sampled cases. Our evaluation demonstrates that MedGemma achieved superior performance (83.84% accuracy) compared to human readers (best radiology resident: 77.27%), representing a significant milestone where AI performance exceeds expert human evaluation on chest X-ray interpretation. The reader study reveals distinct performance patterns between AI models and human experts, with strong inter-reader agreement among radiologists while showing more variable agreement patterns between human readers and AI models. ReXVQA establishes a new standard for evaluating generalist radiological AI systems, offering public leaderboards, fine-grained evaluation splits, structured explanations, and category-level breakdowns. This benchmark lays the foundation for next-generation AI systems capable of mimicking expert-level clinical reasoning beyond narrow pathology classification. Our dataset will be open-sourced at https://huggingface.co/datasets/rajpurkarlab/ReXVQA</p></details> |  |

In addition, AI agents have been specialized for domains such as software engineering, web navigation, and workflow automation. However, this results in agents that are good for one thing but fail to generalize beyond their intended scope. One reason for this is that agent developers provide a highly specialized set of tools or make architectural decisions optimized for a specific use case or benchmark. In this work, we ask the question: what is the minimal set of general tools that can be used to achieve high performance across a diverse set of tasks? Our answer is OpenHands-Versa, a generalist agent built with a modest number of general tools: code editing and execution, web search, as well as multimodal web browsing and file access. Importantly, OpenHands-Versa demonstrates superior or competitive performance over leading specialized agents across three diverse and challenging benchmarks: SWE-Bench Multimodal, GAIA, and The Agent Company, outperforming the best-performing previously published results with absolute improvements in success rate of 9.1, 1.3, and 9.1 points respectively. Further, we show how existing state-of-the-art multi-agent systems fail to generalize beyond their target domains. These results demonstrate the feasibility of developing a generalist agent to solve diverse tasks and establish OpenHands-Versa as a strong baseline for future research.</p></details> |  |

To facilitate private learning with scarce data, Federated Learning has become a standard approach. However, it faces challenges such as computational resource heterogeneity and data heterogeneity among end users. We propose CoMiGS ($\textbf{Co}$llaborative learning with a $\textbf{Mi}$xture of $\textbf{G}$eneralists and $\textbf{S}$pecialists), the first approach to address both challenges. A key innovation of our method is the bi-level optimization formulation of the Mixture-of-Experts learning objective, where the router is optimized using a separate validation set to ensure alignment with the target distribution. We solve our objective with alternating minimization, for which we provide a theoretical analysis. Our method shares generalist experts across users while localizing a varying number of specialist experts, thereby adapting to users' computational resources and preserving privacy. Through extensive experiments, we show CoMiGS effectively balances general and personalized knowledge for each token generation. We demonstrate that CoMiGS remains robust against overfitting-due to the generalists' regularizing effect-while adapting to local data through specialist expertise. We open source our codebase for collaborative LLMs.</p></details> | Camera-ready version |

However, many existing frameworks depend heavily on manually predefined tools and workflows, which hinder their adaptability, scalability, and generalization across domains. In this work, we introduce Alita--a generalist agent designed with the principle of "Simplicity is the ultimate sophistication," enabling scalable agentic reasoning through minimal predefinition and maximal self-evolution. For minimal predefinition, Alita is equipped with only one component for direct problem-solving, making it much simpler and neater than previous approaches that relied heavily on hand-crafted, elaborate tools and workflows. This clean design enhances its potential to generalize to challenging questions, without being limited by tools. For Maximal self-evolution, we enable the creativity of Alita by providing a suite of general-purpose components to autonomously construct, refine, and reuse external capabilities by generating task-related model context protocols (MCPs) from open source, which contributes to scalable agentic reasoning. Notably, Alita achieves 75.15% pass@1 and 87.27% pass@3 accuracy, which is top-ranking among general-purpose agents, on the GAIA benchmark validation dataset, 74.00% and 52.00% pass@1, respectively, on Mathvista and PathVQA, outperforming many agent systems with far greater complexity.

| **[Mol-LLM: Multimodal Generalist Molecular LLM with Improved Graph Utilization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02810v2)** | 2025-05-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have led to models that tackle diverse molecular tasks, such as chemical reaction prediction and molecular property prediction. Large-scale molecular instruction-tuning datasets have enabled sequence-only (e.g., SMILES or SELFIES) generalist molecular LLMs, and researchers are now exploring multimodal approaches that incorporate molecular structural information for further gains. However, a genuinely multimodal, generalist LLM that covers a broad spectrum of molecular tasks has yet to be fully investigated. We observe that naive next token prediction training ignores graph-structural information, limiting an LLM's ability to exploit molecular graphs. To address this, we propose (i) Molecular structure Preference Optimization (MolPO), which facilitates graph usage by optimizing preferences between pairs of correct and perturbed molecular structures, and (ii) an advanced graph encoder with a tailored pre-training strategy to improve the effect of graph utilization by MolPO. Building on these contributions, we introduce Mol-LLM, the first multimodal generalist model that (a) handles a broad spectrum of molecular tasks among molecular LLMs, (b) explicitly leverages molecular-structure information, and (c) takes advantage of extensive instruction tuning. Mol-LLM attains state-of-the-art or comparable results across the most comprehensive molecular-LLM benchmark-even on out-of-distribution datasets for reaction and property prediction, where it surpasses prior generalist molecular LLMs by a large margin.</p></details> | 9 pages, 5 figures |

However, applying these principles to legged locomotion remains a challenge due to continuous dynamics and the need for real-time adaptation across diverse terrains and robot morphologies. In this work, we propose GRoQ-LoCO, a scalable, attention-based framework that learns a single generalist locomotion policy across multiple quadruped robots and terrains, relying solely on offline datasets. Our approach leverages expert demonstrations from two distinct locomotion behaviors - stair traversal (non-periodic gaits) and flat terrain traversal (periodic gaits) - collected across multiple quadruped robots, to train a generalist model that enables behavior fusion. Crucially, our framework operates solely on proprioceptive data from all robots without incorporating any robot-specific encodings. The policy is directly deployable on an Intel i7 nuc, producing low-latency control outputs without any test-time optimization. Our extensive experiments demonstrate zero-shot transfer across highly diverse quadruped robots and terrains, including hardware deployment on the Unitree Go1, a commercially available 12kg robot. Notably, we evaluate challenging cross-robot training setups where different locomotion skills are unevenly distributed across robots, yet observe successful transfer of both flat walking and stair traversal behaviors to all robots at test time. We also show preliminary walking on Stoch 5, a 70kg quadruped, on flat and outdoor terrains without requiring any fine tuning. These results demonstrate the potential of offline, data-driven learning to generalize locomotion across diverse quadruped morphologies and behaviors.</p></details> | <details><summary>18pag...</summary><p>18pages, 16figures, 6tables</p></details> |

Traditional IDC methods often rely on specialist models, which restrict their applicability across varied contexts. This paper introduces the OneDiff model, a novel generalist approach that utilizes a robust vision-language model architecture, integrating a siamese image encoder with a Visual Delta Module. This innovative configuration allows for the precise detection and articulation of fine-grained differences between image pairs. OneDiff is trained through a dual-phase strategy, encompassing Coupled Sample Training and multi-task learning across a diverse array of data types, supported by our newly developed DiffCap Dataset. This dataset merges real-world and synthetic data, enhancing the training process and bolstering the model's robustness. Extensive testing on diverse IDC benchmarks, such as Spot-the-Diff, Image-Editing-Request, and Birds-to-Words, shows that OneDiff consistently outperforms existing state-of-the-art models in accuracy and adaptability, achieving improvements of up to 97% CIDEr points in average. By setting a new benchmark in IDC, OneDiff paves the way for more versatile and effective applications in detecting and describing visual differences. The code, models, and data will be made publicly available.</p></details> |  |
| **[The One RING: a Robotic Indoor Navigation Generalist](https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14401v2)** | 2025-05-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modern robots vary significantly in shape, size, and sensor configurations used to perceive and interact with their environments. However, most navigation policies are embodiment-specific--a policy trained on one robot typically fails to generalize to another, even with minor changes in body size or camera viewpoint. As custom hardware becomes increasingly common, there is a growing need for a single policy that generalizes across embodiments, eliminating the need to retrain for each specific robot. In this paper, we introduce RING (Robotic Indoor Navigation Generalist), an embodiment-agnostic policy that turns any mobile robot into an effective indoor semantic navigator. Trained entirely in simulation, RING leverages large-scale randomization over robot embodiments to enable robust generalization to many real-world platforms. To support this, we augment the AI2-THOR simulator to instantiate robots with controllable configurations, varying in body size, rotation pivot point, and camera parameters. On the visual object-goal navigation task, RING achieves strong cross-embodiment (XE) generalization--72.1% average success rate across five simulated embodiments (a 16.7% absolute improvement on the Chores-S benchmark) and 78.9% across four real-world platforms, including Stretch RE-1, LoCoBot, and Unitree Go1--matching or even surpassing embodiment-specific policies. We further deploy RING on the RB-Y1 wheeled humanoid in a real-world kitchen environment, showcasing its out-of-the-box potential for mobile manipulation platforms.

Unlike existing approaches that either build intricate workflows around a single large model or only provide workflow modularity, our agent integrates tool-based and pure vision agents within a highly modular architecture, enabling different models to collaboratively solve decoupled tasks in a step-by-step manner. Our generality is demonstrated by our ability to evaluate not only pure vision-based real-world benchmarks (i.e., OSWorld), but also more general or tool-intensive benchmarks (e.g., GAIA and SWE-Bench). Specifically, we achieve $\mathbf{7.27\%}$ accuracy on OSWorld, higher than Claude-Computer-Use.

However, prompting-based methods often remain shallow and unstable, while fine-tuned medical LLMs suffer from poor generalization under distribution shifts and limited adaptability to unseen clinical scenarios. To address these limitations, we present TAGS, a test-time framework that combines a broadly capable generalist with a domain-specific specialist to offer complementary perspectives without any model fine-tuning or parameter updates. To support this generalist-specialist reasoning process, we introduce two auxiliary modules: a hierarchical retrieval mechanism that provides multi-scale exemplars by selecting examples based on both semantic and rationale-level similarity, and a reliability scorer that evaluates reasoning consistency to guide final answer aggregation. TAGS achieves strong performance across nine MedQA benchmarks, boosting GPT-4o accuracy by 13.8%, DeepSeek-R1 by 16.8%, and improving a vanilla 7B model from 14.1% to 23.9%. These results surpass several fine-tuned medical LLMs, without any parameter updates.

For this reason, online HD map construction methods use live sensor data to infer map information instead. Research on real map changes shows that oftentimes entire parts of an HD map remain unchanged and can be used as a prior. We therefore introduce M3TR (Multi-Masking Map Transformer), a generalist approach for HD map completion both with and without offline HD map priors. As a necessary foundation, we address shortcomings in ground truth labels for Argoverse 2 and nuScenes and propose the first comprehensive benchmark for HD map completion. Unlike existing models that specialize in a single kind of map change, which is unrealistic for deployment, our Generalist model handles all kinds of changes, matching the effectiveness of Expert models. With our map masking as augmentation regime, we can even achieve a +1.4 mAP improvement without a prior. Finally, by fully utilizing prior HD map elements and optimizing query designs, M3TR outperforms existing methods by +4.3 mAP while being the first real-world deployable model for offline HD map priors.

While existing methods speed up inference by reducing sampling steps, substantial step intervals often introduce cumulative errors. Moreover, they struggle to balance the commonality of degradation representations and restoration quality. To address these challenges, we introduce \textbf{DGSolver}, a diffusion generalist solver with universal posterior sampling. We first derive the exact ordinary differential equations for generalist diffusion models and tailor high-order solvers with a queue-based accelerated sampling strategy to improve both accuracy and efficiency. We then integrate universal posterior sampling to better approximate manifold-constrained gradients, yielding a more accurate noise estimation and correcting errors in inverse inference. Extensive experiments show that DGSolver outperforms state-of-the-art methods in restoration accuracy, stability, and scalability, both qualitatively and quantitatively. Code and models will be available at https://github.com/MiliLab/DGSolver.</p></details> |  |
| **[On Path to Multimodal Generalist: General-Level and General-Bench](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04620v1)** | 2025-05-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) is currently experiencing rapid growth, driven by the advanced capabilities of LLMs. Unlike earlier specialists, existing MLLMs are evolving towards a Multimodal Generalist paradigm. Initially limited to understanding multiple modalities, these models have advanced to not only comprehend but also generate across modalities. Their capabilities have expanded from coarse-grained to fine-grained multimodal understanding and from supporting limited modalities to arbitrary ones. While many benchmarks exist to assess MLLMs, a critical question arises: Can we simply assume that higher performance across tasks indicates a stronger MLLM capability, bringing us closer to human-level AI? We argue that the answer is not as straightforward as it seems. This project introduces General-Level, an evaluation framework that defines 5-scale levels of MLLM performance and generality, offering a methodology to compare MLLMs and gauge the progress of existing systems towards more robust multimodal generalists and, ultimately, towards AGI. At the core of the framework is the concept of Synergy, which measures whether models maintain consistent capabilities across comprehension and generation, and across multiple modalities. To support this evaluation, we present General-Bench, which encompasses a broader spectrum of skills, modalities, formats, and capabilities, including over 700 tasks and 325,800 instances. The evaluation results that involve over 100 existing state-of-the-art MLLMs uncover the capability rankings of generalists, highlighting the challenges in reaching genuine AI. We expect this project to pave the way for future research on next-generation multimodal foundation models, providing a robust infrastructure to accelerate the realization of AGI.

Previous vision encoders, typically pre-trained with single-image reconstruction or two-image contrastive learning, tend to capture static information, often neglecting the dynamic aspects vital for embodied tasks. Recently, video diffusion models (VDMs) demonstrate the ability to predict future frames and showcase a strong understanding of physical world. We hypothesize that VDMs inherently produce visual representations that encompass both current static information and predicted future dynamics, thereby providing valuable guidance for robot action learning. Based on this hypothesis, we propose the Video Prediction Policy (VPP), which learns implicit inverse dynamics model conditioned on predicted future representations inside VDMs. To predict more precise future, we fine-tune pre-trained video foundation model on robot datasets along with internet human manipulation data. In experiments, VPP achieves a 18.6\% relative improvement on the Calvin ABC-D generalization benchmark compared to the previous state-of-the-art, and demonstrates a 31.6\% increase in success rates for complex real-world dexterous manipulation tasks.

Motion generation models focus on creating diverse, realistic motions from inputs like text, audio, or keyframes, while motion estimation models aim to reconstruct accurate motion trajectories from observations like videos. Despite sharing underlying representations of temporal dynamics and kinematics, this separation limits knowledge transfer between tasks and requires maintaining separate models. We present GENMO, a unified Generalist Model for Human Motion that bridges motion estimation and generation in a single framework. Our key insight is to reformulate motion estimation as constrained motion generation, where the output motion must precisely satisfy observed conditioning signals. Leveraging the synergy between regression and diffusion, GENMO achieves accurate global motion estimation while enabling diverse motion generation. We also introduce an estimation-guided training objective that exploits in-the-wild videos with 2D annotations and text descriptions to enhance generative diversity. Furthermore, our novel architecture handles variable-length motions and mixed multimodal conditions (text, audio, video) at different time intervals, offering flexible control. This unified approach creates synergistic benefits: generative priors improve estimated motions under challenging conditions like occlusions, while diverse video data enhances generation capabilities. Extensive experiments demonstrate GENMO's effectiveness as a generalist framework that successfully handles multiple human motion tasks within a single model.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://research.nvidia.com/labs/dair/genmo/</p></details> |

Building on this, various methods further fine-tune the pre-trained T2I model for specific tasks. However, this requires separate model architectures, training designs, and multiple parameter sets to handle different tasks. In this paper, we introduce UniVG, a generalist diffusion model capable of supporting a diverse range of image generation tasks with a single set of weights. UniVG treats multi-modal inputs as unified conditions to enable various downstream applications, ranging from T2I generation, inpainting, instruction-based editing, identity-preserving generation, and layout-guided generation, to depth estimation and referring segmentation. Through comprehensive empirical studies on data mixing and multi-task training, we provide detailed insights into the training processes and decisions that inform our final designs. For example, we show that T2I generation and other tasks, such as instruction-based editing, can coexist without performance trade-offs, while auxiliary tasks like depth estimation and referring segmentation enhance image editing. Notably, our model can even outperform some task-specific models on their respective benchmarks, marking a significant step towards a unified image generation model.</p></details> |  |

However, acquiring such high-quality trajectory data typically demands meticulous supervision from humans or superior models, which can be either expensive or license-constrained. In this paper, we explore how far an LLM can improve its reasoning by self-synthesizing reasoning paths as training data without any additional supervision. Existing self-synthesizing methods, such as STaR, suffer from poor generalization to out-of-domain (OOD) reasoning tasks. We hypothesize it is due to that their self-synthesized reasoning paths are too task-specific, lacking general task-agnostic reasoning guidance. To address this, we propose Reasoning Generalist via Self-Improvement (ReGenesis), a method to self-synthesize reasoning paths as post-training data by progressing from abstract to concrete. More specifically, ReGenesis self-synthesizes reasoning paths by converting general reasoning guidelines into task-specific ones, generating reasoning structures, and subsequently transforming these structures into reasoning paths, without the need for human-designed task-specific examples used in existing methods. We show that ReGenesis achieves superior performance on all in-domain and OOD settings tested compared to existing methods. For six OOD tasks specifically, while previous methods exhibited an average performance decrease of approximately 4.6% after post training, ReGenesis delivers around 6.1% performance improvement. We also conduct in-depth analysis of our framework and show ReGenesis is effective across various LLMs and design choices.</p></details> |  |

The incorporation of power actuation and sensing capabilities in CPU designs is indicative of this, enabling the deployment of system software that can actively monitor and adjust energy consumption and performance at runtime. While reinforcement learning (RL) would seem ideal for the design of such energy efficiency control systems, online training presents challenges ranging from the lack of proper models for setting up an adequate simulated environment, to perturbation (noise) and reliability issues, if training is deployed on a live system. In this paper we discuss the use of offline reinforcement learning as an alternative approach for the design of an autonomous CPU power controller, with the goal of improving the energy efficiency of parallel applications at runtime without unduly impacting their performance. Offline RL sidesteps the issues incurred by online RL training by leveraging a dataset of state transitions collected from arbitrary policies prior to training. Our methodology applies offline RL to a gray-box approach to energy efficiency, combining online application-agnostic performance data (e.g., heartbeats) and hardware performance counters to ensure that the scientific objectives are met with limited performance degradation. Evaluating our method on a variety of compute-bound and memory-bound benchmarks and controlling power on a live system through Intel's Running Average Power Limit, we demonstrate that such an offline-trained agent can substantially reduce energy consumption at a tolerable performance degradation cost.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 5 figures, 3 tables and unpublished</p></details> |
| **[A Simple Unified Uncertainty-Guided Framework for Offline-to-Online Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.07541v3)** | 2026-01-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Offline reinforcement learning (RL) provides a promising solution to learning an agent fully relying on a data-driven paradigm. However, constrained by the limited quality of the offline dataset, its performance is often sub-optimal. Therefore, it is desired to further finetune the agent via extra online interactions before deployment. Unfortunately, offline-to-online RL can be challenging due to two main challenges: constrained exploratory behavior and state-action distribution shift. In view of this, we propose a Simple Unified uNcertainty-Guided (SUNG) framework, which naturally unifies the solution to both challenges with the tool of uncertainty. Specifically, SUNG quantifies uncertainty via a VAE-based state-action visitation density estimator. To facilitate efficient exploration, SUNG presents a practical optimistic exploration strategy to select informative actions with both high value and high uncertainty. Moreover, SUNG develops an adaptive exploitation method by applying conservative offline RL objectives to high-uncertainty samples and standard online RL objectives to low-uncertainty samples to smoothly bridge offline and online stages. SUNG achieves state-of-the-art online finetuning performance when combined with different offline RL methods, across various environments and datasets in D4RL benchmark.

Optimizing generative policies is computationally prohibitive, typically necessitating backpropagation through ODE solvers. We address this by learning a lightweight refinement module within an explicit, data-derived trust region of the flow manifold, rather than sacrificing the iterative generation capability via single-step distillation. This way, we bypass solver differentiation and eliminate the need for balancing loss terms, ensuring stable improvement while fully preserving the flow's iterative expressivity. Empirically, DeFlow achieves superior performance on the challenging OGBench benchmark and demonstrates efficient offline-to-online adaptation.</p></details> | 13 pages, 3 figures |

These patients frequently rely on MV for breathing. Given the high risk of death in such cases, optimal MV settings can reduce mortality, minimize ventilator-induced lung injury, shorten ICU stays, and ease the strain on healthcare resources. However, optimizing MV settings remains a complex and error-prone process due to patient-specific variability. While Offline Reinforcement Learning (RL) shows promise for optimizing MV settings, current methods struggle with the hybrid (continuous and discrete) nature of MV settings. Discretizing continuous settings leads to exponential growth in the action space, which limits the number of optimizable settings. Converting the predictions back to continuous can cause a distribution shift, compromising safety and performance. To address this challenge, in the IntelliLung project, we are developing an AI-based approach where we constrain the action space and employ factored action critics. This approach allows us to scale to six optimizable settings compared to 2-3 in previous studies. We adapt SOTA offline RL algorithms to operate directly on hybrid action spaces, avoiding the pitfalls of discretization. We also introduce a clinically grounded reward function based on ventilator-free days and physiological targets. Using multiobjective optimization for reward selection, we show that this leads to a more equitable consideration of all clinically relevant objectives. Notably, we develop a system in close collaboration with healthcare professionals that is aligned with real-world clinical objectives and designed with future deployment in mind.</p></details> | Accepted to AAAI-26 |

Existing goal-conditioned and hierarchical offline RL methods decompose such tasks and generate intermediate rewards to mitigate limitations of traditional offline RL, but usually overlook temporal dependencies among subgoals and rely on imprecise reward shaping, leading to suboptimal policies. To address these issues, we propose STO-RL (Offline RL using LLM-Guided Subgoal Temporal Order), an offline RL framework that leverages large language models (LLMs) to generate temporally ordered subgoal sequences and corresponding state-to-subgoal-stage mappings. Using this temporal structure, STO-RL applies potential-based reward shaping to transform sparse terminal rewards into dense, temporally consistent signals, promoting subgoal progress while avoiding suboptimal solutions. The resulting augmented dataset with shaped rewards enables efficient offline training of high-performing policies. Evaluations on four discrete and continuous sparse-reward benchmarks demonstrate that STO-RL consistently outperforms state-of-the-art offline goal-conditioned and hierarchical RL baselines, achieving faster convergence, higher success rates, and shorter trajectories. Ablation studies further confirm STO-RL's robustness to imperfect or noisy LLM-generated subgoal sequences, demonstrating that LLM-guided subgoal temporal structures combined with theoretically grounded reward shaping provide a practical and scalable solution for long-horizon offline RL.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at International Conference on Autonomous Agents and Multiagent Systems (AAMAS 2026)</p></details> |
| **[BiTrajDiff: Bidirectional Trajectory Generation with Diffusion Models for Offline Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05762v4)** | 2026-01-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in offline Reinforcement Learning (RL) have proven that effective policy learning can benefit from imposing conservative constraints on pre-collected datasets. However, such static datasets often exhibit distribution bias, resulting in limited generalizability. To address this limitation, a straightforward solution is data augmentation (DA), which leverages generative models to enrich data distribution. Despite the promising results, current DA techniques focus solely on reconstructing future trajectories from given states, while ignoring the exploration of history transitions that reach them. This single-direction paradigm inevitably hinders the discovery of diverse behavior patterns, especially those leading to critical states that may have yielded high-reward outcomes. In this work, we introduce Bidirectional Trajectory Diffusion (BiTrajDiff), a novel DA framework for offline RL that models both future and history trajectories from any intermediate states. Specifically, we decompose the trajectory generation task into two independent yet complementary diffusion processes: one generating forward trajectories to predict future dynamics, and the other generating backward trajectories to trace essential history transitions.BiTrajDiff can efficiently leverage critical states as anchors to expand into potentially valuable yet underexplored regions of the state space, thereby facilitating dataset diversity. Extensive experiments on the D4RL benchmark suite demonstrate that BiTrajDiff achieves superior performance compared to other advanced DA methods across various offline RL backbones.</p></details> |  |
| **[Offline Meta-Reinforcement Learning with Flow-Based Task Inference and Adaptive Correction of Feature Overgeneralization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07164v1)** | 2026-01-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Offline meta-reinforcement learning (OMRL) combines the strengths of learning from diverse datasets in offline RL with the adaptability to new tasks of meta-RL, promising safe and efficient knowledge acquisition by RL agents. However, OMRL still suffers extrapolation errors due to out-of-distribution (OOD) actions, compromised by broad task distributions and Markov Decision Process (MDP) ambiguity in meta-RL setups. Existing research indicates that the generalization of the $Q$ network affects the extrapolation error in offline RL. This paper investigates this relationship by decomposing the $Q$ value into feature and weight components, observing that while decomposition enhances adaptability and convergence in the case of high-quality data, it often leads to policy degeneration or collapse in complex tasks. We observe that decomposed $Q$ values introduce a large estimation bias when the feature encounters OOD samples, a phenomenon we term ''feature overgeneralization''. To address this issue, we propose FLORA, which identifies OOD samples by modeling feature distributions and estimating their uncertainties. FLORA integrates a return feedback mechanism to adaptively adjust feature components. Furthermore, to learn precise task representations, FLORA explicitly models the complex task distribution using a chain of invertible transformations. We theoretically and empirically demonstrate that FLORA achieves rapid adaptation and meta-policy improvement compared to baselines across various environments.</p></details> |  |
| **[Improving and Accelerating Offline RL in Large Discrete Action Spaces with Structured Policy Initialization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04441v1)** | 2026-01-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement learning in discrete combinatorial action spaces requires searching over exponentially many joint actions to simultaneously select multiple sub-actions that form coherent combinations. Existing approaches either simplify policy learning by assuming independence across sub-actions, which often yields incoherent or invalid actions, or attempt to learn action structure and control jointly, which is slow and unstable. We introduce Structured Policy Initialization (SPIN), a two-stage framework that first pre-trains an Action Structure Model (ASM) to capture the manifold of valid actions, then freezes this representation and trains lightweight policy heads for control. On challenging discrete DM Control benchmarks, SPIN improves average return by up to 39% over the state of the art while reducing time to convergence by up to 12.8$\times$.</p></details> |  |

Existing methods either exhaustively evaluate the action space, making them computationally infeasible, or factorize Q-values, failing to represent joint sub-action effects. We propose Branch Value Estimation (BraVE), a value-based method that uses tree-structured action traversal to evaluate a linear number of joint actions while preserving dependency structure. BraVE outperforms prior offline RL methods by up to $20\times$ in environments with over four million actions.</p></details> |  |

Hackers and penetration testers are excessively injecting malicious contents in the training data (and in testing data too) that leads to false results that are very hard to inspect and predict. We have analyzed several recent technologies used (from deep reinforcement learning to federated learning) for the DPAs and their safety, security, & countermeasures. The problem setup along with the problem estimation is shown in the MuJoCo environment with performance of HalfCheetah before the dataset is poisoned and after the dataset is poisoned. We have analyzed several risks associated with the DPAs and falsification in medical data from popular poisoning data attacks to some popular data defenses. We have proposed robust offline reinforcement learning (Offline RL) for the safety and reliability with weighted hash verification along with density-ratio weighted behavioral cloning (DWBC) algorithm. The four stages of the proposed algorithm (as the Stage 0, the Stage 1, the Stage 2, and the Stage 3) are described with respect to offline RL, safety, and security for DPAs. The conclusion and future scope are provided with the intent to combine DWBC with other data defense strategies to counter and protect future contamination cyberattacks.</p></details> | 10 pages, 3 figures |
| **[Sparse Offline Reinforcement Learning with Corruption Robustness](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24768v1)** | 2025-12-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We investigate robustness to strong data corruption in offline sparse reinforcement learning (RL). In our setting, an adversary may arbitrarily perturb a fraction of the collected trajectories from a high-dimensional but sparse Markov decision process, and our goal is to estimate a near optimal policy. The main challenge is that, in the high-dimensional regime where the number of samples $N$ is smaller than the feature dimension $d$, exploiting sparsity is essential for obtaining non-vacuous guarantees but has not been systematically studied in offline RL. We analyse the problem under uniform coverage and sparse single-concentrability assumptions. While Least Square Value Iteration (LSVI), a standard approach for robust offline RL, performs well under uniform coverage, we show that integrating sparsity into LSVI is unnatural, and its analysis may break down due to overly pessimistic bonuses. To overcome this, we propose actor-critic methods with sparse robust estimator oracles, which avoid the use of pointwise pessimistic bonuses and provide the first non-vacuous guarantees for sparse offline RL under single-policy concentrability coverage. Moreover, we extend our results to the contaminated setting and show that our algorithm remains robust under strong contamination. Our results provide the first non-vacuous guarantees in high-dimensional sparse MDPs with single-policy concentrability coverage and corruption, showing that learning a near-optimal policy remains possible in regimes where traditional robust offline RL techniques may fail.</p></details> |  |
| **[Forecasting in Offline Reinforcement Learning for Non-stationary Environments](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01987v3)** | 2025-12-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Offline Reinforcement Learning (RL) provides a promising avenue for training policies from pre-collected datasets when gathering additional interaction data is infeasible. However, existing offline RL methods often assume stationarity or only consider synthetic perturbations at test time, assumptions that often fail in real-world scenarios characterized by abrupt, time-varying offsets. These offsets can lead to partial observability, causing agents to misperceive their true state and degrade performance. To overcome this challenge, we introduce Forecasting in Non-stationary Offline RL (FORL), a framework that unifies (i) conditional diffusion-based candidate state generation, trained without presupposing any specific pattern of future non-stationarity, and (ii) zero-shot time-series foundation models. FORL targets environments prone to unexpected, potentially non-Markovian offsets, requiring robust agent performance from the onset of each episode. Empirical evaluations on offline RL benchmarks, augmented with real-world time-series data to simulate realistic non-stationarity, demonstrate that FORL consistently improves performance compared to competitive baselines. By integrating zero-shot forecasting with the agent's experience, we aim to bridge the gap between offline RL and the complexities of real-world, non-stationary environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>The T...</summary><p>The Thirty-Ninth Annual Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems, NeurIPS 2025</p></details> |
| **[Accelerating Diffusion Planners in Offline RL via Reward-Aware Consistency Trajectory Distillation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07822v2)** | 2025-12-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Although diffusion models have achieved strong results in decision-making tasks, their slow inference speed remains a key limitation. While consistency models offer a potential solution, existing applications to decision-making either struggle with suboptimal demonstrations under behavior cloning or rely on complex concurrent training of multiple networks under the actor-critic framework. In this work, we propose a novel approach to consistency distillation for offline reinforcement learning that directly incorporates reward optimization into the distillation process. Our method achieves single-step sampling while generating higher-reward action trajectories through decoupled training and noise-free reward signals. Empirical evaluations on the Gym MuJoCo, FrankaKitchen, and long horizon planning benchmarks demonstrate that our approach can achieve a 9.7% improvement over previous state-of-the-art while offering up to 142x speedup over diffusion counterparts in inference time.</p></details> |  |
| **[Horizon Reduction as Information Loss in Offline Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00831v1)** | 2025-12-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Horizon reduction is a common design strategy in offline reinforcement learning (RL), used to mitigate long-horizon credit assignment, improve stability, and enable scalable learning through truncated rollouts, windowed training, or hierarchical decomposition (Levine et al., 2020; Prudencio et al., 2023; Park et al., 2025). Despite recent empirical evidence that horizon reduction can improve scaling on challenging offline RL benchmarks, its theoretical implications remain underdeveloped (Park et al., 2025). In this paper, we show that horizon reduction can induce fundamental and irrecoverable information loss in offline RL. We formalize horizon reduction as learning from fixed-length trajectory segments and prove that, under this paradigm and any learning interface restricted to fixed-length trajectory segments, optimal policies may be statistically indistinguishable from suboptimal ones even with infinite data and perfect function approximation. Through a set of minimal counterexample Markov decision processes (MDPs), we identify three distinct structural failure modes: (i) prefix indistinguishability leading to identifiability failure, (ii) objective misspecification induced by truncated returns, and (iii) offline dataset support and representation aliasing. Our results establish necessary conditions under which horizon reduction can be safe and highlight intrinsic limitations that cannot be overcome by algorithmic improvements alone, complementing algorithmic work on conservative objectives and distribution shift that addresses a different axis of offline RL difficulty (Fujimoto et al., 2019; Kumar et al., 2020; Gulcehre et al., 2020).</p></details> | 13 pages, 3 figures |
| **[Masking Teacher and Reinforcing Student for Distilling Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22238v1)** | 2025-12-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large-scale vision-language models (VLMs) have recently achieved remarkable multimodal understanding, but their massive size makes them impractical for deployment on mobile or edge devices. This raises the need for compact yet capable VLMs that can efficiently learn from powerful large teachers. However, distilling knowledge from a large teacher to a small student remains challenging due to their large size gap: the student often fails to reproduce the teacher's complex, high-dimensional representations, leading to unstable learning and degraded performance. To address this, we propose Masters (Masking Teacher and Reinforcing Student), a mask-progressive reinforcement learning (RL) distillation framework. Masters first masks non-dominant weights of the teacher to reduce unnecessary complexity, then progressively restores the teacher by gradually increasing its capacity during training. This strategy allows the student to learn richer representations from the teacher in a smooth and stable manner. To further refine knowledge transfer, Masters integrates an offline RL stage with two complementary rewards: an accuracy reward that measures the correctness of the generated responses, and a distillation reward that quantifies the ease of transferring responses from teacher to student. Unlike online think-answer RL paradigms that are computationally expensive and generate lengthy responses, our offline RL leverages pre-generated responses from masked teachers. These provide rich yet efficient guidance, enabling students to achieve strong performance without requiring the think-answer process.</p></details> |  |
| **[Sample-Efficient Policy Constraint Offline Deep Reinforcement Learning based on Sample Filtering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20115v1)** | 2025-12-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Offline reinforcement learning (RL) aims to learn a policy that maximizes the expected return using a given static dataset of transitions. However, offline RL faces the distribution shift problem. The policy constraint offline RL method is proposed to solve the distribution shift problem. During the policy constraint offline RL training, it is important to ensure the difference between the learned policy and behavior policy within a given threshold. Thus, the learned policy heavily relies on the quality of the behavior policy. However, a problem exists in existing policy constraint methods: if the dataset contains many low-reward transitions, the learned will be contained with a suboptimal reference policy, leading to slow learning speed, low sample efficiency, and inferior performances. This paper shows that the sampling method in policy constraint offline RL that uses all the transitions in the dataset can be improved. A simple but efficient sample filtering method is proposed to improve the sample efficiency and the final performance. First, we evaluate the score of the transitions by average reward and average discounted reward of episodes in the dataset and extract the transition samples of high scores. Second, the high-score transition samples are used to train the offline RL algorithms. We verify the proposed method in a series of offline RL algorithms and benchmark tasks. Experimental results show that the proposed method outperforms baselines.</p></details> |  |

Assuming the optimality of human demonstrations is core to existing VLA policies. However, we claim that in highly dexterous and precise manipulation tasks, human demonstrations are noisy and suboptimal. GR-RL proposes a multi-stage training pipeline that filters, augments, and reinforces the demonstrations by reinforcement learning. First, GR-RL learns a vision-language-conditioned task progress, filters the demonstration trajectories, and only keeps the transitions that contribute positively to the progress. Specifically, we show that by directly applying offline RL with sparse reward, the resulting $Q$-values can be treated as a robust progress function. Next, we introduce morphological symmetry augmentation that greatly improves the generalization and performance of GR-RL. Lastly, to better align the VLA policy with its deployment behaviors for high-precision control, we perform online RL by learning a latent space noise predictor. With this pipeline, GR-RL is, to our knowledge, the first learning-based policy that can autonomously lace up a shoe by threading shoelaces through multiple eyelets with an 83.3% success rate, a task requiring long-horizon reasoning, millimeter-level precision, and compliant soft-body interaction. We hope GR-RL provides a step toward enabling generalist robot foundation models to specialize into reliable real-world experts.</p></details> |  |
| **[Diffusion Self-Weighted Guidance for Offline Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18345v2)** | 2025-12-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Offline reinforcement learning (RL) recovers the optimal policy $π$ given historical observations of an agent. In practice, $π$ is modeled as a weighted version of the agent's behavior policy $μ$, using a weight function $w$ working as a critic of the agent's behavior. Though recent approaches to offline RL based on diffusion models have exhibited promising results, the computation of the required scores is challenging due to their dependence on the unknown $w$. In this work, we alleviate this issue by constructing a diffusion over both the actions and the weights. With the proposed setting, the required scores are directly obtained from the diffusion model without learning extra networks. Our main conceptual contribution is a novel guidance method, where guidance (which is a function of $w$) comes from the same diffusion model, therefore, our proposal is termed Self-Weighted Guidance (SWG). We show that SWG generates samples from the desired distribution on toy examples and performs on par with state-of-the-art methods on D4RL's challenging environments, while maintaining a streamlined training pipeline. We further validate SWG through ablation studies on weight formulations and scalability.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in Transactions on Machine Learning Research (TMLR). 21 pages, 6 figures</p></details> |
| **[CORE: Compensable Reward as a Catalyst for Improving Offline RL in Wireless Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19671v1)** | 2025-12-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Real-world wireless data are expensive to collect and often lack sufficient expert demonstrations, causing existing offline RL methods to overfit suboptimal behaviors and exhibit unstable performance. To address this issue, we propose CORE, an offline RL framework specifically designed for wireless environments. CORE identifies latent expert trajectories from noisy datasets via behavior embedding clustering, and trains a conditional variational autoencoder with a contrastive objective to separate expert and non-expert behaviors in latent space. Based on the learned representations, CORE constructs compensable rewards that reflect expert-likelihood, effectively guiding policy learning under limited or imperfect supervision. More broadly, this work represents one of the early systematic explorations of offline RL in wireless networking, where prior adoption remains limited. Beyond introducing offline RL techniques to this domain, we further examine intrinsic wireless data characteristics and develop a domain-aligned algorithm that explicitly accounts for their structural properties. While offline RL has not yet been fully established as a standard methodology in the wireless community, our study aims to provide foundational insights and empirical evidence to support its broader acceptance.</p></details> |  |
| **[MOORL: A Framework for Integrating Offline-Online Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09574v2)** | 2025-12-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Sample efficiency and exploration remain critical challenges in Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL), particularly in complex domains. Offline RL, which enables agents to learn optimal policies from static, pre-collected datasets, has emerged as a promising alternative. However, offline RL is constrained by issues such as out-of-distribution (OOD) actions that limit policy performance and generalization. To overcome these limitations, we propose Meta Offline-Online Reinforcement Learning (MOORL), a hybrid framework that unifies offline and online RL for efficient and scalable learning. While previous hybrid methods rely on extensive design components and added computational complexity to utilize offline data effectively, MOORL introduces a meta-policy that seamlessly adapts across offline and online trajectories. This enables the agent to leverage offline data for robust initialization while utilizing online interactions to drive efficient exploration. Our theoretical analysis demonstrates that the hybrid approach enhances exploration by effectively combining the complementary strengths of offline and online data. Furthermore, we demonstrate that MOORL learns a stable Q-function without added complexity. Extensive experiments on 28 tasks from the D4RL and V-D4RL benchmarks validate its effectiveness, showing consistent improvements over state-of-the-art offline and hybrid RL baselines. With minimal computational overhead, MOORL achieves strong performance, underscoring its potential for practical applications in real-world scenarios.</p></details> |  |

However, its practical adoption is often hindered by the need for explicit reward annotations, which can be costly to engineer or difficult to obtain retrospectively. To address this, we propose ReLOAD (Reinforcement Learning with Offline Reward Annotation via Distillation), a novel reward annotation framework for offline RL. Unlike existing methods that depend on complex alignment procedures, our approach adapts Random Network Distillation (RND) to generate intrinsic rewards from expert demonstrations using a simple yet effective embedding discrepancy measure. First, we train a predictor network to mimic a fixed target network's embeddings based on expert state transitions. Later, the prediction error between these networks serves as a reward signal for each transition in the static dataset. This mechanism provides a structured reward signal without requiring handcrafted reward annotations. We provide a formal theoretical construct that offers insights into how RND prediction errors effectively serve as intrinsic rewards by distinguishing expert-like transitions. Experiments on the D4RL benchmark demonstrate that ReLOAD enables robust offline policy learning and achieves performance competitive with traditional reward-annotated methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[Offline Reinforcement Learning for End-to-End Autonomous Driving](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18662v1)** | 2025-12-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>End-to-end (E2E) autonomous driving models that take only camera images as input and directly predict a future trajectory are appealing for their computational efficiency and potential for improved generalization via unified optimization; however, persistent failure modes remain due to reliance on imitation learning (IL). While online reinforcement learning (RL) could mitigate IL-induced issues, the computational burden of neural rendering-based simulation and large E2E networks renders iterative reward and hyperparameter tuning costly. We introduce a camera-only E2E offline RL framework that performs no additional exploration and trains solely on a fixed simulator dataset. Offline RL offers strong data efficiency and rapid experimental iteration, yet is susceptible to instability from overestimation on out-of-distribution (OOD) actions. To address this, we construct pseudo ground-truth trajectories from expert driving logs and use them as a behavior regularization signal, suppressing imitation of unsafe or suboptimal behavior while stabilizing value learning. Training and closed-loop evaluation are conducted in a neural rendering environment learned from the public nuScenes dataset. Empirically, the proposed method achieves substantial improvements in collision rate and route completion compared with IL baselines. Our code will be available at [URL].</p></details> | 15 pages |

However, datasets containing suboptimal and fragmented trajectories present challenges for reward propagation, resulting in inaccurate value estimation and degraded policy performance. While trajectory stitching via generative models offers a promising solution, existing augmentation methods frequently produce trajectories that are either confined to the support of the behavior policy or violate the underlying dynamics, thereby limiting their effectiveness for policy improvement. We propose ASTRO, a data augmentation framework that generates distributionally novel and dynamics-consistent trajectories for offline RL. ASTRO first learns a temporal-distance representation to identify distinct and reachable stitch targets. We then employ a dynamics-guided stitch planner that adaptively generates connecting action sequences via Rollout Deviation Feedback, defined as the gap between target state sequence and the actual arrived state sequence by executing predicted actions, to improve trajectory stitching's feasibility and reachability. This approach facilitates effective augmentation through stitching and ultimately enhances policy learning. ASTRO outperforms prior offline RL augmentation methods across various algorithms, achieving notable performance gain on the challenging OGBench suite and demonstrating consistent improvements on standard offline RL benchmarks such as D4RL.</p></details> |  |

In offline RL, data providers share pre-collected datasets -- either as individual transitions or sequences of transitions forming trajectories -- to enable the training of RL models (also called agents) without direct interaction with the environments. Offline RL saves interactions with environments compared to traditional RL, and has been effective in critical areas, such as navigation tasks. Meanwhile, concerns about privacy leakage from offline RL datasets have emerged. To safeguard private information in offline RL datasets, we propose the first differential privacy (DP) offline dataset synthesis method, PrivORL, which leverages a diffusion model and diffusion transformer to synthesize transitions and trajectories, respectively, under DP. The synthetic dataset can then be securely released for downstream analysis and research. PrivORL adopts the popular approach of pre-training a synthesizer on public datasets, and then fine-tuning on sensitive datasets using DP Stochastic Gradient Descent (DP-SGD). Additionally, PrivORL introduces curiosity-driven pre-training, which uses feedback from the curiosity module to diversify the synthetic dataset and thus can generate diverse synthetic transitions and trajectories that closely resemble the sensitive dataset. Extensive experiments on five sensitive offline RL datasets show that our method achieves better utility and fidelity in both DP transition and trajectory synthesis compared to baselines. The replication package is available at the GitHub repository.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at NDSS 2026; code available at https://github.com/2019ChenGong/PrivORL</p></details> |

While existing Safe Offline RL methods typically enforce soft expected-cost constraints, they do not guarantee forward invariance. Conversely, Control Barrier Functions (CBFs) provide rigorous safety guarantees but usually depend on expert-designed barrier functions or full knowledge of the system dynamics. We introduce Value-Guided Offline Control Barrier Functions (V-OCBF), a framework that learns a neural CBF entirely from offline demonstrations. Unlike prior approaches, V-OCBF does not assume access to the dynamics model; instead, it derives a recursive finite-difference barrier update, enabling model-free learning of a barrier that propagates safety information over time. Moreover, V-OCBF incorporates an expectile-based objective that avoids querying the barrier on out-of-distribution actions and restricts updates to the dataset-supported action set. The learned barrier is then used with a Quadratic Program (QP) formulation to synthesize real-time safe control. Across multiple case studies, V-OCBF yields substantially fewer safety violations than baseline methods while maintaining strong task performance, highlighting its scalability for offline synthesis of safety-critical controllers without online interaction or hand-engineered barriers.</p></details> | <details><summary>23 pa...</summary><p>23 pages, 8 figure, 7 tables</p></details> |
| **[Latent Action World Models for Control with Unlabeled Trajectories](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10016v1)** | 2025-12-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Inspired by how humans combine direct interaction with action-free experience (e.g., videos), we study world models that learn from heterogeneous data. Standard world models typically rely on action-conditioned trajectories, which limits effectiveness when action labels are scarce. We introduce a family of latent-action world models that jointly use action-conditioned and action-free data by learning a shared latent action representation. This latent space aligns observed control signals with actions inferred from passive observations, enabling a single dynamics model to train on large-scale unlabeled trajectories while requiring only a small set of action-labeled ones. We use the latent-action world model to learn a latent-action policy through offline reinforcement learning (RL), thereby bridging two traditionally separate domains: offline RL, which typically relies on action-conditioned data, and action-free training, which is rarely used with subsequent RL. On the DeepMind Control Suite, our approach achieves strong performance while using about an order of magnitude fewer action-labeled samples than purely action-conditioned baselines. These results show that latent actions enable training on both passive and interactive data, which makes world models learn more efficiently.</p></details> |  |
| **[Scalable Offline Model-Based RL with Action Chunks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08108v1)** | 2025-12-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we study whether model-based reinforcement learning (RL), in particular model-based value expansion, can provide a scalable recipe for tackling complex, long-horizon tasks in offline RL. Model-based value expansion fits an on-policy value function using length-n imaginary rollouts generated by the current policy and a learned dynamics model. While larger n reduces bias in value bootstrapping, it amplifies accumulated model errors over long horizons, degrading future predictions. We address this trade-off with an \emph{action-chunk} model that predicts a future state from a sequence of actions (an "action chunk") instead of a single action, which reduces compounding errors. In addition, instead of directly training a policy to maximize rewards, we employ rejection sampling from an expressive behavioral action-chunk policy, which prevents model exploitation from out-of-distribution actions. We call this recipe \textbf{Model-Based RL with Action Chunks (MAC)}. Through experiments on highly challenging tasks with large-scale datasets of up to 100M transitions, we show that MAC achieves the best performance among offline model-based RL algorithms, especially on challenging long-horizon tasks.</p></details> | 22 pages, 7 figures |
| **[RAMAC: Multimodal Risk-Aware Offline Reinforcement Learning and the Role of Behavior Regularization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02695v2)** | 2025-12-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In safety-critical domains where online data collection is infeasible, offline reinforcement learning (RL) offers an attractive alternative but only if policies deliver high returns without incurring catastrophic lower-tail risk. Prior work on risk-averse offline RL achieves safety at the cost of value or model-based pessimism, and restricted policy classes that limit policy expressiveness, whereas diffusion/flow-based expressive generative policies trained with a behavioral-cloning (BC) objective have been used only in risk-neutral settings. Here, we address this gap by introducing the \textbf{Risk-Aware Multimodal Actor-Critic (RAMAC)}, which couples an expressive generative actor with a distributional critic and, to our knowledge, is the first model-free approach that learns \emph{risk-aware expressive generative policies}. RAMAC differentiates a composite objective that adds a Conditional Value-at-Risk (CVaR) term to a BC loss, achieving risk-sensitive learning in complex multimodal scenarios. Since out-of-distribution (OOD) actions are a major driver of catastrophic failures in offline RL, we further analyze OOD behavior under prior-anchored perturbation schemes from recent BC-regularized risk-averse offline RL. This clarifies why a behavior-regularized objective that directly constrains the expressive generative policy to the dataset support provides an effective, risk-agnostic mechanism for suppressing OOD actions in modern expressive policies. We instantiate RAMAC with a diffusion-based actor, using it both to illustrate the analysis in a 2-D risky bandit and to deploy OOD-action detectors on Stochastic-D4RL benchmarks, empirically validating our insights. Across these tasks, we observe consistent gains in $\mathrm{CVaR}_{0.1}$ while maintaining strong returns. Our implementation is available at GitHub: https://github.com/KaiFukazawa/RAMAC.git</p></details> |  |
| **[Data Fusion-Enhanced Decision Transformer for Stable Cross-Domain Generalization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09173v2)** | 2025-12-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Cross-domain shifts present a significant challenge for decision transformer (DT) policies. Existing cross-domain policy adaptation methods typically rely on a single simple filtering criterion to select source trajectory fragments and stitch them together. They match either state structure or action feasibility. However, the selected fragments still have poor stitchability: state structures can misalign, the return-to-go (RTG) becomes incomparable when the reward or horizon changes, and actions may jump at trajectory junctions. As a result, RTG tokens lose continuity, which compromises DT's inference ability. To tackle these challenges, we propose Data Fusion-Enhanced Decision Transformer (DFDT), a compact pipeline that restores stitchability. Particularly, DFDT fuses scarce target data with selectively trusted source fragments via a two-level data filter, maximum mean discrepancy (MMD) mismatch for state-structure alignment, and optimal transport (OT) deviation for action feasibility. It then trains on a feasibility-weighted fusion distribution. Furthermore, DFDT replaces RTG tokens with advantage-conditioned tokens, which improves the continuity of the semantics in the token sequence. It also applies a $Q$-guided regularizer to suppress junction value and action jumps. Theoretically, we provide bounds that tie state value and policy performance gaps to the MMD-mismatch and OT-deviation measures, and show that the bounds tighten as these two measures shrink. We show that DFDT improves return and stability over strong offline RL and sequence-model baselines across gravity, kinematic, and morphology shifts on D4RL-style control tasks, and further corroborate these gains with token-stitching and sequence-semantics stability analyses.</p></details> | 32 pages,4 figures |

In this paper, we uncover a misalignment between original and distilled datasets, observing that a high-quality original dataset does not necessarily yield a superior synthetic dataset. Through an empirical analysis of policy performance under varying levels of training loss, we show that datasets with greater state diversity outperforms those with higher state quality when training loss is substantial, as is often the case in OBD, whereas the relationship reverses under minimal loss, which contributes to the misalignment. By associating state quality and diversity in reducing pivotal and surrounding error, respectively, our theoretical analysis establishes that surrounding error plays a more crucial role in policy performance when pivotal error is large, thereby highlighting the importance of state diversity in OBD scenario. Furthermore, we propose a novel yet simple algorithm, state density weighted (SDW) OBD, which emphasizes state diversity by weighting the distillation objective using the reciprocal of state density, thereby distilling a more diverse state information into synthetic data. Extensive experiments across multiple D4RL datasets confirm that SDW significantly enhances OBD performance when the original dataset exhibits limited state diversity.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 5 figures, 5 tables</p></details> |

However, existing studies primarily focus on train-time robustness (handling dynamics shifts from training data), neglecting the test-time robustness against dynamics perturbations when deployed in practical scenarios. In this paper, we investigate dual (both train-time and test-time) robustness against dynamics shifts in cross-domain offline RL. We first empirically show that the policy trained with cross-domain offline RL exhibits fragility under dynamics perturbations during evaluation, particularly when target domain data is limited. To address this, we introduce a novel robust cross-domain Bellman (RCB) operator, which enhances test-time robustness against dynamics perturbations while staying conservative to the out-of-distribution dynamics transitions, thus guaranteeing the train-time robustness. To further counteract potential value overestimation or underestimation caused by the RCB operator, we introduce two techniques, the dynamic value penalty and the Huber loss, into our framework, resulting in the practical \textbf{D}ual-\textbf{RO}bust \textbf{C}ross-domain \textbf{O}ffline RL (DROCO) algorithm. Extensive empirical results across various dynamics shift scenarios show that DROCO outperforms strong baselines and exhibits enhanced robustness to dynamics perturbations.</p></details> |  |

We show that symmetric regularization does not permit an analytic optimal policy $π^*$, posing a challenge to practical utility of symmetric BRPO. We approximate $π^*$ by the Taylor series of Pearson-Vajda $χ^n$ divergences and show that an analytic policy expression exists only when the series is capped at $n=5$. To compute the solution in a numerically stable manner, we propose to Taylor expand the conditional symmetry term of the symmetric divergence loss, leading to a novel algorithm: Symmetric $f$-Actor Critic (S$f$-AC). S$f$-AC achieves consistently strong results across various D4RL MuJoCo tasks. Additionally, S$f$-AC avoids per-environment failures observed in IQL, SQL, XQL and AWAC, opening up possibilities for more diverse and effective regularization choices for offline RL.</p></details> |  |
| **[Algorithmic Guarantees for Distilling Supervised and Offline RL Datasets](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00536v1)** | 2025-11-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Given a training dataset, the goal of dataset distillation is to derive a synthetic dataset such that models trained on the latter perform as well as those trained on the training dataset. In this work, we develop and analyze an efficient dataset distillation algorithm for supervised learning, specifically regression in $\mathbb{R}^d$, based on matching the losses on the training and synthetic datasets with respect to a fixed set of randomly sampled regressors without any model training. Our first key contribution is a novel performance guarantee proving that our algorithm needs only $\tilde{O}(d^2)$ sampled regressors to derive a synthetic dataset on which the MSE loss of any bounded linear model is nearly the same as its MSE loss on the given training data. In particular, the model optimized on the synthetic data has close to minimum loss on the training data, thus performing nearly as well as the model optimized on the latter. Complementing this, we also prove a matching lower bound of $Ω(d^2)$ for the number of sampled regressors showing the tightness of our analysis. Our second contribution is to extend our algorithm to offline RL dataset distillation by matching the Bellman loss, unlike previous works which used a behavioral cloning objective. This is the first such method which leverages both, the rewards and the next state information, available in offline RL datasets, without any policy model optimization. Our algorithm generates a synthetic dataset whose Bellman loss with respect to any linear action-value predictor is close to the latter's Bellman loss on the offline RL training dataset. Therefore, a policy associated with an action-value predictor optimized on the synthetic dataset performs nearly as well as that derived from the one optimized on the training data. We conduct experiments to validate our theoretical guarantees and observe performance gains.</p></details> | 29 pages, 2 figures |

This is feasible because an online learning agent can repurpose its historical interactions as offline dataset. We formalize this idea into a framework that accommodates several variants of offline RL incorporation such as final policy recommendation and online fine-tuning. We further introduce convenient techniques to improve its effectiveness in enhancing online learning efficiency. Our extensive and systematic empirical analyses show that 1) the effectiveness of the proposed framework depends strongly on the nature of the task, 2) our proposed techniques greatly enhance its effectiveness, and 3) existing online fine-tuning methods are overall ineffective, calling for more research therein.</p></details> |  |

We propose BiCQL-ML, a policy-free offline IRL algorithm that jointly optimizes a reward function and a conservative Q-function in a bi-level framework, thereby avoiding explicit policy learning. The method alternates between (i) learning a conservative Q-function via Conservative Q-Learning (CQL) under the current reward, and (ii) updating the reward parameters to maximize the expected Q-values of expert actions while suppressing over-generalization to out-of-distribution actions. This procedure can be viewed as maximum likelihood estimation under a soft value matching principle. We provide theoretical guarantees that BiCQL-ML converges to a reward function under which the expert policy is soft-optimal. Empirically, we show on standard offline RL benchmarks that BiCQL-ML improves both reward recovery and downstream policy performance compared to existing offline IRL baselines.</p></details> | 8 pages, 3 figures |

Although concerns have been raised regarding the coarseness of this time-step size, which might distort patient dynamics and lead to suboptimal treatment policies, the extent to which this is a problem in practice remains unexplored. In this work, we conducted empirical experiments for a controlled comparison of four time-step sizes ($Δt\!=\!1,2,4,8$ h) on this domain, following an identical offline RL pipeline. To enable a fair comparison across time-step sizes, we designed action re-mapping methods that allow for evaluation of policies on datasets with different time-step sizes, and conducted cross-$Δt$ model selections under two policy learning setups. Our goal was to quantify how time-step size influences state representation learning, behavior cloning, policy training, and off-policy evaluation. Our results show that performance trends across $Δt$ vary as learning setups change, while policies learned at finer time-step sizes ($Δt = 1$ h and $2$ h) using a static behavior policy achieve the overall best performance and stability. Our work highlights time-step size as a core design choice in offline RL for healthcare and provides evidence supporting alternatives beyond the conventional 4-hour setup.</p></details> |  |

We propose an end-to-end offline RL framework for dual vasopressor administration in Intensive Care Units (ICUs) that directly addresses this challenge through principled action space design. Our method integrates discrete, continuous, and directional dosing strategies with conservative Q-learning and incorporates a novel recurrent modeling using a replay buffer to capture temporal dependencies in ICU time-series data. Our comparative analysis of norepinephrine dosing strategies across different action space formulations reveals that the designed action spaces improve interpretability and facilitate clinical adoption while preserving efficacy. Empirical results on eICU and MIMIC demonstrate that action space design profoundly influences learned behavioral policies. Compared with baselines, the proposed methods achieve more than 3x expected reward improvements, while aligning with established clinical protocols.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 5 figures.

However, the individual experts may be privacy-sensitive in that the learnt policy may retain information about their precise choices. In some domains like personalized retrieval, advertising and healthcare, the expert choices are considered sensitive data. To provably protect the privacy of such experts, we propose a novel consensus-based expert-level differentially private offline RL training approach compatible with any existing offline RL algorithm. We prove rigorous differential privacy guarantees, while maintaining strong empirical performance. Unlike existing work in differentially private RL, we supplement the theory with proof-of-concept experiments on classic RL environments featuring large continuous state spaces, demonstrating substantial improvements over a natural baseline across multiple tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Top 1...</summary><p>Top 10% submission at TMLR (J2C Certification)</p></details> |
| **[A Comparison Between Decision Transformers and Traditional Offline Reinforcement Learning Algorithms](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16475v1)** | 2025-11-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The field of Offline Reinforcement Learning (RL) aims to derive effective policies from pre-collected datasets without active environment interaction. While traditional offline RL algorithms like Conservative Q-Learning (CQL) and Implicit Q-Learning (IQL) have shown promise, they often face challenges in balancing exploration and exploitation, especially in environments with varying reward densities. The recently proposed Decision Transformer (DT) approach, which reframes offline RL as a sequence modelling problem, has demonstrated impressive results across various benchmarks. This paper presents a comparative study evaluating the performance of DT against traditional offline RL algorithms in dense and sparse reward settings for the ANT continous control environment. Our research investigates how these algorithms perform when faced with different reward structures, examining their ability to learn effective policies and generalize across varying levels of feedback. Through empirical analysis in the ANT environment, we found that DTs showed less sensitivity to varying reward density compared to other methods and particularly excelled with medium-expert datasets in sparse reward scenarios. In contrast, traditional value-based methods like IQL showed improved performance in dense reward settings with high-quality data, while CQL offered balanced performance across different data qualities. Additionally, DTs exhibited lower variance in performance but required significantly more computational resources compared to traditional approaches. These findings suggest that sequence modelling approaches may be more suitable for scenarios with uncertain reward structures or mixed-quality data, while value-based methods remain competitive in settings with dense rewards and high-quality demonstrations.</p></details> | <details><summary>15 pa...</summary><p>15 pages, 4 figures, published in the Proceedings of the 46th Annual conference of the South African Institute of Computer Scientists and Information Technologists (SIACSIT 2025)</p></details> |

This study introduces DeepEN, a reinforcement learning (RL)-based framework that personalizes enteral nutrition (EN) dosing for critically ill patients using electronic health record data. DeepEN was trained on over 11,000 ICU patients from the MIMIC-IV database to generate 4-hourly, patient-specific targets for caloric, protein, and fluid intake. The model's state space integrates demographics, comorbidities, vital signs, laboratory results, and prior interventions relevant to nutritional management, while its reward function balances short-term physiological and nutrition-related goals with long-term survival. A dueling double deep Q-network with Conservative Q-Learning regularization is used to ensure safe and reliable policy learning from retrospective data. DeepEN achieved a 3.7 $\pm$ 0.17 percentage-point absolute reduction in estimated mortality compared with the clinician policy (18.8% vs 22.5%) and higher expected returns compared with guideline-based dosing (11.89 vs 8.11), with improvements in key nutritional biomarkers. U-shaped associations between deviations from clinician dosing and mortality suggest that the learned policy aligns with high-value clinician actions while diverging from suboptimal ones. These findings demonstrate the feasibility of conservative offline RL for individualized EN therapy and suggest that data-driven personalization may improve outcomes beyond guideline- or heuristic-based approaches.</p></details> |  |

We present a general-purpose method, RL with Experience and Corrections via Advantage-conditioned Policies (RECAP), that provides for RL training of VLAs via advantage conditioning. Our method incorporates heterogeneous data into the self-improvement process, including demonstrations, data from on-policy collection, and expert teleoperated interventions provided during autonomous execution. RECAP starts by pre-training a generalist VLA with offline RL, which we call $π^{*}_{0.6}$, that can then be specialized to attain high performance on downstream tasks through on-robot data collection. We show that the $π^{*}_{0.6}$ model trained with the full RECAP method can fold laundry in real homes, reliably assemble boxes, and make espresso drinks using a professional espresso machine. On some of the hardest tasks, RECAP more than doubles task throughput and roughly halves the task failure rate.</p></details> |  |

Recent research has shown that incorporating intrinsic motivation mechanisms into EDTs improves performance across exploration tasks, yet the representational mechanisms underlying these improvements remain unexplored. In this paper, we introduce a systematic post-hoc explainability framework to analyze how intrinsic motivation shapes learned embeddings in EDTs. Through statistical analysis of embedding properties (including covariance structure, vector magnitudes, and orthogonality), we reveal that different intrinsic motivation variants create fundamentally different representational structures. Our analysis demonstrates environment-specific correlation patterns between embedding metrics and performance that explain why intrinsic motivation improves policy learning. These findings show that intrinsic motivation operates beyond simple exploration bonuses, acting as a representational prior that shapes embedding geometry in biologically plausible ways, creating environment-specific organizational structures that facilitate better decision-making.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for poster presentation at the NeurIPS 2025 workshop "CogInterp: Interpreting Cognition in Deep Learning Models", San Diego, CA, USA</p></details> |
| **[Treatment Stitching with Schrödinger Bridge for Enhancing Offline Reinforcement Learning in Adaptive Treatment Strategies](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12075v1)** | 2025-11-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Adaptive treatment strategies (ATS) are sequential decision-making processes that enable personalized care by dynamically adjusting treatment decisions in response to evolving patient symptoms. While reinforcement learning (RL) offers a promising approach for optimizing ATS, its conventional online trial-and-error learning mechanism is not permissible in clinical settings due to risks of harm to patients. Offline RL tackles this limitation by learning policies exclusively from historical treatment data, but its performance is often constrained by data scarcity-a pervasive challenge in clinical domains. To overcome this, we propose Treatment Stitching (TreatStitch), a novel data augmentation framework that generates clinically valid treatment trajectories by intelligently stitching segments from existing treatment data. Specifically, TreatStitch identifies similar intermediate patient states across different trajectories and stitches their respective segments. Even when intermediate states are too dissimilar to stitch directly, TreatStitch leverages the Schrödinger bridge method to generate smooth and energy-efficient bridging trajectories that connect dissimilar states. By augmenting these synthetic trajectories into the original dataset, offline RL can learn from a more diverse dataset, thereby improving its ability to optimize ATS. Extensive experiments across multiple treatment datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of TreatStitch in enhancing offline RL performance. Furthermore, we provide a theoretical justification showing that TreatStitch maintains clinical validity by avoiding out-of-distribution transitions.</p></details> | <details><summary>19 pa...</summary><p>19 pages, 5 figures, AAAI conference</p></details> |

Extreme $Q$-Learning (XQL) is a recent offline RL method that models Bellman errors using the Extreme Value Theorem, yielding strong empirical performance. However, XQL and its stabilized variant MXQL suffer from notable limitations: both require extensive hyperparameter tuning specific to each dataset and domain, and also exhibit instability during training. To address these issues, we proposed a principled method to estimate the temperature coefficient $β$ via quantile regression under mild assumptions. To further improve training stability, we introduce a value regularization technique with mild generalization, inspired by recent advances in constrained value learning. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm achieves competitive or superior performance across a range of benchmark tasks, including D4RL and NeoRL2, while maintaining stable training dynamics and using a consistent set of hyperparameters across all datasets and domains.</p></details> |  |

We posit this failure stems from data corruption creating sharp minima in the loss landscape, leading to poor generalization. To address this, we are the first to apply Sharpness-Aware Minimization (SAM) as a general-purpose, plug-and-play optimizer for offline RL. SAM seeks flatter minima, guiding models to more robust parameter regions. We integrate SAM into strong baselines for data corruption: IQL, a top-performing offline RL algorithm in this setting, and RIQL, an algorithm designed specifically for data-corruption robustness. We evaluate them on D4RL benchmarks with both random and adversarial corruption. Our SAM-enhanced methods consistently and significantly outperform the original baselines. Visualizations of the reward surface confirm that SAM finds smoother solutions, providing strong evidence for its effectiveness in improving the robustness of offline RL agents.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted as an Oral Presentation at the AAAI 2026 Student Abstract and Poster Program (SAPP)</p></details> |
| **[Provable Domain Adaptation for Offline Reinforcement Learning with Limited Samples](https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12136v4)** | 2025-11-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Offline reinforcement learning (RL) learns effective policies from a static target dataset. The performance of state-of-the-art offline RL algorithms notwithstanding, it relies on the size of the target dataset, and it degrades if limited samples in the target dataset are available, which is often the case in real-world applications. To address this issue, domain adaptation that leverages auxiliary samples from related source datasets (such as simulators) can be beneficial. However, establishing the optimal way to trade off the limited target dataset and the large-but-biased source dataset while ensuring provably theoretical guarantees remains an open challenge. To the best of our knowledge, this paper proposes the first framework that theoretically explores the impact of the weights assigned to each dataset on the performance of offline RL. In particular, we establish performance bounds and the existence of the optimal weight, which can be computed in closed form under simplifying assumptions. We also provide algorithmic guarantees in terms of convergence to a neighborhood of the optimum. Notably, these results depend on the quality of the source dataset and the number of samples in the target dataset. Our empirical results on the well-known offline Procgen benchmark substantiate the theoretical contributions in this work.</p></details> |  |
| **[Improved Offline Reinforcement Learning via Quantum Metric Encoding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10187v1)** | 2025-11-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement learning (RL) with limited samples is common in real-world applications. However, offline RL performance under this constraint is often suboptimal. We consider an alternative approach to dealing with limited samples by introducing the Quantum Metric Encoder (QME). In this methodology, instead of applying the RL framework directly on the original states and rewards, we embed the states into a more compact and meaningful representation, where the structure of the encoding is inspired by quantum circuits. For classical data, QME is a classically simulable, trainable unitary embedding and thus serves as a quantum-inspired module, on a classical device. For quantum data in the form of quantum states, QME can be implemented directly on quantum hardware, allowing for training without measurement or re-encoding. We evaluated QME on three datasets, each limited to 100 samples. We use Soft-Actor-Critic (SAC) and Implicit-Q-Learning (IQL), two well-known RL algorithms, to demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. From the experimental results, we find that training offline RL agents on QME-embedded states with decoded rewards yields significantly better performance than training on the original states and rewards. On average across the three datasets, for maximum reward performance, we achieve a 116.2% improvement for SAC and 117.6% for IQL. We further investigate the $Δ$-hyperbolicity of our framework, a geometric property of the state space known to be important for the RL training efficacy. The QME-embedded states exhibit low $Δ$-hyperbolicity, suggesting that the improvement after embedding arises from the modified geometry of the state space induced by QME. Thus, the low $Δ$-hyperbolicity and the corresponding effectiveness of QME could provide valuable information for developing efficient offline RL methods under limited-sample conditions.</p></details> |  |
| **[Diffusion Policies with Value-Conditional Optimization for Offline Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08922v1)** | 2025-11-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In offline reinforcement learning, value overestimation caused by out-of-distribution (OOD) actions significantly limits policy performance. Recently, diffusion models have been leveraged for their strong distribution-matching capabilities, enforcing conservatism through behavior policy constraints. However, existing methods often apply indiscriminate regularization to redundant actions in low-quality datasets, resulting in excessive conservatism and an imbalance between the expressiveness and efficiency of diffusion modeling. To address these issues, we propose DIffusion policies with Value-conditional Optimization (DIVO), a novel approach that leverages diffusion models to generate high-quality, broadly covered in-distribution state-action samples while facilitating efficient policy improvement. Specifically, DIVO introduces a binary-weighted mechanism that utilizes the advantage values of actions in the offline dataset to guide diffusion model training. This enables a more precise alignment with the dataset's distribution while selectively expanding the boundaries of high-advantage actions. During policy improvement, DIVO dynamically filters high-return-potential actions from the diffusion model, effectively guiding the learned policy toward better performance. This approach achieves a critical balance between conservatism and explorability in offline RL. We evaluate DIVO on the D4RL benchmark and compare it against state-of-the-art baselines. Empirical results demonstrate that DIVO achieves superior performance, delivering significant improvements in average returns across locomotion tasks and outperforming existing methods in the challenging AntMaze domain, where sparse rewards pose a major difficulty.</p></details> | IROS 2025 |
| **[Bayes Adaptive Monte Carlo Tree Search for Offline Model-based Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11234v3)** | 2025-11-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Offline RL is a powerful approach for data-driven decision-making and control. Compared to model-free methods, offline model-based RL (MBRL) explicitly learns world models from a static dataset and uses them as surrogate simulators, improving the data efficiency and enabling the learned policy to potentially generalize beyond the dataset support. However, there could be various MDPs that behave identically on the offline dataset and dealing with the uncertainty about the true MDP can be challenging. In this paper, we propose modeling offline MBRL as a Bayes Adaptive Markov Decision Process (BAMDP), which is a principled framework for addressing model uncertainty. We further propose a novel Bayes Adaptive Monte-Carlo planning algorithm capable of solving BAMDPs in continuous state and action spaces with stochastic transitions. This planning process is based on Monte Carlo Tree Search and can be integrated into offline MBRL as a policy improvement operator in policy iteration. Our ``RL + Search" framework follows in the footsteps of superhuman AIs like AlphaZero, improving on current offline MBRL methods by incorporating more computation input. The proposed algorithm significantly outperforms state-of-the-art offline RL methods on twelve D4RL MuJoCo tasks and three target tracking tasks in a challenging, stochastic tokamak control simulator.

MCS devices are percutaneous micro-axial flow pumps that provide left ventricular unloading and forward blood flow, but current weaning strategies vary significantly across care teams and lack data-driven approaches. Offline reinforcement learning (RL) has proven to be successful in sequential decision-making tasks, but our setting presents challenges for training and evaluating traditional offline RL methods: prohibition of online patient interaction, highly uncertain circulatory dynamics due to concurrent treatments, and limited data availability. We developed an end-to-end machine learning framework with two key contributions (1) Clinically-aware OOD-regularized Model-based Policy Optimization (CORMPO), a density-regularized offline RL algorithm for out-of-distribution suppression that also incorporates clinically-informed reward shaping and (2) a Transformer-based probabilistic digital twin that models MCS circulatory dynamics for policy evaluation with rich physiological and clinical metrics. We prove that \textsf{CORMPO} achieves theoretical performance guarantees under mild assumptions. CORMPO attains a higher reward than the offline RL baselines by 28% and higher scores in clinical metrics by 82.6% on real and synthetic datasets. Our approach offers a principled framework for safe offline policy learning in high-stakes medical applications where domain expertise and safety constraints are essential.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we introduce a new reasoning data generation framework spanning diverse skills and levels of complexity with over 1M high-quality synthetic vision-centric questions. The dataset also includes preference data and instruction prompts supporting both offline and online RL. Our synthesis framework proceeds in two stages: (1) scale; and (2) complexity. Reasoning traces are then synthesized through a two-stage process that leverages VLMs and reasoning LLMs, producing CoT traces for VLMs that capture the richness and diverse cognitive behaviors found in frontier reasoning models. Remarkably, we show that finetuning Qwen2.5-VL-7B on our data outperforms all open-data baselines across all evaluated vision-centric benchmarks, and even surpasses strong closed-data models such as MiMo-VL-7B-RL on V* Bench, CV-Bench and MMStar-V. Perhaps most surprising, despite being entirely vision-centric, our data transfers positively to text-only reasoning (MMLU-Pro) and audio reasoning (MMAU), demonstrating its effectiveness. Similarly, despite not containing videos or embodied visual data, we observe notable gains when evaluating on a single-evidence embodied QA benchmark (NiEH). Finally, we use our data to analyze the entire VLM post-training pipeline. Our empirical analysis highlights that (i) SFT on high-quality data with non-linear reasoning traces is essential for effective online RL, (ii) staged offline RL matches online RL's performance while reducing compute demands, and (iii) careful SFT on high quality data can substantially improve out-of-domain, cross-modality transfer.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://nvlabs.github.io/LongGroundedThoughts/</p></details> |

However, it is unclear how to recover the implicit policy from the learned implicit Q-function and why IQL can utilize weighted regression for policy extraction. IDQL reinterprets IQL as an actor-critic method and gets weights of implicit policy, however, this weight only holds for the optimal value function. In this work, we introduce a different way to solve the implicit policy-finding problem (IPF) by formulating this problem as an optimization problem. Based on this optimization problem, we further propose two practical algorithms AlignIQL and AlignIQL-hard, which inherit the advantages of decoupling actor from critic in IQL and provide insights into why IQL can use weighted regression for policy extraction. Compared with IQL and IDQL, we find our method keeps the simplicity of IQL and solves the implicit policy-finding problem. Experimental results on D4RL datasets show that our method achieves competitive or superior results compared with other SOTA offline RL methods. Especially in complex sparse reward tasks like Antmaze and Adroit, our method outperforms IQL and IDQL by a significant margin.</p></details> | <details><summary>32 pa...</summary><p>32 pages, 1 figure, 13 tables</p></details> |

To address this, offline RL algorithms typically impose constraints on action selection, which can be systematically categorized into density, support, and sample constraints. However, we show that each category has inherent limitations: density and sample constraints tend to be overly conservative in many scenarios, while the support constraint, though least restrictive, faces challenges in accurately modeling the behavior policy. To overcome these limitations, we propose a new neighborhood constraint that restricts action selection in the Bellman target to the union of neighborhoods of dataset actions. Theoretically, the constraint not only bounds extrapolation errors and distribution shift under certain conditions, but also approximates the support constraint without requiring behavior policy modeling. Moreover, it retains substantial flexibility and enables pointwise conservatism by adapting the neighborhood radius for each data point. In practice, we employ data quality as the adaptation criterion and design an adaptive neighborhood constraint. Building on an efficient bilevel optimization framework, we develop a simple yet effective algorithm, Adaptive Neighborhood-constrained Q learning (ANQ), to perform Q learning with target actions satisfying this constraint. Empirically, ANQ achieves state-of-the-art performance on standard offline RL benchmarks and exhibits strong robustness in scenarios with noisy or limited data.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to NeurIPS 2025 (Spotlight)</p></details> |
| **[Dense and Diverse Goal Coverage in Multi Goal Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25311v1)** | 2025-10-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement Learning algorithms are primarily focused on learning a policy that maximizes expected return. As a result, the learned policy can exploit one or few reward sources. However, in many natural situations, it is desirable to learn a policy that induces a dispersed marginal state distribution over rewarding states, while maximizing the expected return which is typically tied to reaching a goal state. This aspect remains relatively unexplored. Existing techniques based on entropy regularization and intrinsic rewards use stochasticity for encouraging exploration to find an optimal policy which may not necessarily lead to dispersed marginal state distribution over rewarding states. Other RL algorithms which match a target distribution assume the latter to be available apriori. This may be infeasible in large scale systems where enumeration of all states is not possible and a state is determined to be a goal state only upon reaching it. We formalize the problem of maximizing the expected return while uniformly visiting the goal states as Multi Goal RL in which an oracle classifier over the state space determines the goal states. We propose a novel algorithm that learns a high-return policy mixture with marginal state distribution dispersed over the set of goal states. Our algorithm is based on optimizing a custom RL reward which is computed - based on the current policy mixture - at each iteration for a set of sampled trajectories. The latter are used via an offline RL algorithm to update the policy mixture. We prove performance guarantees for our algorithm, showing efficient convergence bounds for optimizing a natural objective which captures the expected return as well as the dispersion of the marginal state distribution over the goal states. We design and perform experiments on synthetic MDPs and standard RL environments to evaluate the effectiveness of our algorithm.</p></details> | 21 pages, 5 figures |
| **[LRT-Diffusion: Calibrated Risk-Aware Guidance for Diffusion Policies](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24983v1)** | 2025-10-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion policies are competitive for offline reinforcement learning (RL) but are typically guided at sampling time by heuristics that lack a statistical notion of risk. We introduce LRT-Diffusion, a risk-aware sampling rule that treats each denoising step as a sequential hypothesis test between the unconditional prior and the state-conditional policy head. Concretely, we accumulate a log-likelihood ratio and gate the conditional mean with a logistic controller whose threshold tau is calibrated once under H0 to meet a user-specified Type-I level alpha. This turns guidance from a fixed push into an evidence-driven adjustment with a user-interpretable risk budget. Importantly, we deliberately leave training vanilla (two heads with standard epsilon-prediction) under the structure of DDPM. LRT guidance composes naturally with Q-gradients: critic-gradient updates can be taken at the unconditional mean, at the LRT-gated mean, or a blend, exposing a continuum from exploitation to conservatism. We standardize states and actions consistently at train and test time and report a state-conditional out-of-distribution (OOD) metric alongside return. On D4RL MuJoCo tasks, LRT-Diffusion improves the return-OOD trade-off over strong Q-guided baselines in our implementation while honoring the desired alpha. Theoretically, we establish level-alpha calibration, concise stability bounds, and a return comparison showing when LRT surpasses Q-guidance-especially when off-support errors dominate. Overall, LRT-Diffusion is a drop-in, inference-time method that adds principled, calibrated risk control to diffusion policies for offline RL.</p></details> |  |

In our work, we propose a practical approach to offline RL with large language models (LLMs). We recast the problem as reward-weighted fine-tuning, which can be solved using similar techniques to supervised fine-tuning (SFT). To showcase the value of our approach, we apply it to learning short-horizon question-answering policies of a fixed length, where the agent reasons about potential answers or asks clarifying questions. Our work stands in a stark contrast to state-of-the-art methods in this domain, based on SFT and direct preference optimization, which have additional hyper-parameters and do not directly optimize for rewards. We compare to them empirically, and report major gains in both optimized rewards and language quality.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at NeurIPS 2025 (main conference)</p></details> |

A key challenge is to identify and utilize source samples that are most relevant to the target domain. Existing approaches address this challenge by measuring domain gaps through domain classifiers, target transition dynamics modeling, or mutual information estimation using contrastive loss. However, these methods often require large target datasets, which is impractical in many real-world scenarios. In this work, we address cross-domain offline RL under a limited target data setting, identifying two primary challenges: (1) Dataset imbalance, which is caused by large source and small target datasets and leads to overfitting in neural network-based domain gap estimators, resulting in uninformative measurements; and (2) Partial domain overlap, where only a subset of the source data is closely aligned with the target domain. To overcome these issues, we propose DmC, a novel framework for cross-domain offline RL with limited target samples. Specifically, DmC utilizes $k$-nearest neighbor ($k$-NN) based estimation to measure domain proximity without neural network training, effectively mitigating overfitting. Then, by utilizing this domain proximity, we introduce a nearest-neighbor-guided diffusion model to generate additional source samples that are better aligned with the target domain, thus enhancing policy learning with more effective source samples. Through theoretical analysis and extensive experiments in diverse MuJoCo environments, we demonstrate that DmC significantly outperforms state-of-the-art cross-domain offline RL methods, achieving substantial performance gains.</p></details> | <details><summary>accep...</summary><p>accepted at ECAI 2025; offline cross-domain reinforcement learning with a guided diffusion model;</p></details> |
| **[Mitigating Distribution Shift in Model-based Offline RL via Shifts-aware Reward Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12830v3)** | 2025-10-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Model-based offline reinforcement learning trains policies using pre-collected datasets and learned environment models, eliminating the need for direct real-world environment interaction. However, this paradigm is inherently challenged by distribution shift~(DS). Existing methods address this issue by leveraging off-policy mechanisms and estimating model uncertainty, but they often result in inconsistent objectives and lack a unified theoretical foundation. This paper offers a comprehensive analysis that disentangles the problem into two fundamental components: model bias and policy shift. Our theoretical and empirical investigations reveal how these factors distort value estimation and restrict policy optimization. To tackle these challenges, we derive a novel shifts-aware reward through a unified probabilistic inference framework, which modifies the vanilla reward to refine value learning and facilitate policy training. Building on this, we develop a practical implementation that leverages classifier-based techniques to approximate the adjusted reward for effective policy optimization. Empirical results across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed approach mitigates distribution shift and achieves superior or comparable performance, validating our theoretical insights.</p></details> |  |

However, it remains limited by its reliance on high-quality, task-specific data, restricting adaptability to the diverse range of real-world object configurations and scenarios. In contrast, non-expert data -- such as play data, suboptimal demonstrations, partial task completions, or rollouts from suboptimal policies -- can offer broader coverage and lower collection costs. However, conventional imitation learning approaches fail to utilize this data effectively. To address these challenges, we posit that with right design decisions, offline reinforcement learning can be used as a tool to harness non-expert data to enhance the performance of imitation learning policies. We show that while standard offline RL approaches can be ineffective at actually leveraging non-expert data under the sparse data coverage settings typically encountered in the real world, simple algorithmic modifications can allow for the utilization of this data, without significant additional assumptions. Our approach shows that broadening the support of the policy distribution can allow imitation algorithms augmented by offline RL to solve tasks robustly, showing considerably enhanced recovery and generalization behavior. In manipulation tasks, these innovations significantly increase the range of initial conditions where learned policies are successful when non-expert data is incorporated. Moreover, we show that these methods are able to leverage all collected data, including partial or suboptimal demonstrations, to bolster task-directed policy performance. This underscores the importance of algorithmic techniques for using non-expert data for robust policy learning in robotics. Website: https://uwrobotlearning.github.io/RISE-offline/</p></details> |  |

We prove the approximate optimality of this approach when integrated with an approximate offline RL oracle and no-regret online optimization. We also present a practical approximation that can be combined with any offline RL algorithm, eliminating the need for offline policy evaluation.

Diffusion-based planners facilitate long-horizon decision-making by generating high-quality trajectories through iterative denoising, guided by return-maximizing objectives. However, existing guided sampling strategies such as Classifier Guidance, Classifier-Free Guidance, and Monte Carlo Sample Selection either produce suboptimal multi-modal actions, struggle with distributional drift, or incur prohibitive inference-time costs. To address these challenges, we propose Prior Guidance (PG), a novel guided sampling framework that replaces the standard Gaussian prior of a behavior-cloned diffusion model with a learnable distribution, optimized via a behavior-regularized objective. PG directly generates high-value trajectories without costly reward optimization of the diffusion model itself, and eliminates the need to sample multiple candidates at inference for sample selection. We present an efficient training strategy that applies behavior regularization in latent space, and empirically demonstrate that PG outperforms state-of-the-art diffusion policies and planners across diverse long-horizon offline RL benchmarks.Our code is available at https://github.com/ku-dmlab/PG.</p></details> |  |

This enables models to learn complex functions in a generalizable manner. Motivated by this observation, we investigate the benefits of iterative computation for temporal difference (TD) methods in reinforcement learning (RL). Typically they represent value functions in a monolithic fashion, without iterative compute. We introduce floq (flow-matching Q-functions), an approach that parameterizes the Q-function using a velocity field and trains it using techniques from flow-matching, typically used in generative modeling. This velocity field underneath the flow is trained using a TD-learning objective, which bootstraps from values produced by a target velocity field, computed by running multiple steps of numerical integration. Crucially, floq allows for more fine-grained control and scaling of the Q-function capacity than monolithic architectures, by appropriately setting the number of integration steps. Across a suite of challenging offline RL benchmarks and online fine-tuning tasks, floq improves performance by nearly 1.8x. floq scales capacity far better than standard TD-learning architectures, highlighting the potential of iterative computation for value learning.</p></details> | <details><summary>Added...</summary><p>Added new experiments, fixed typos.

| **[Horizon Reduction Makes RL Scalable](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04168v3)** | 2025-10-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this work, we study the scalability of offline reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms. In principle, a truly scalable offline RL algorithm should be able to solve any given problem, regardless of its complexity, given sufficient data, compute, and model capacity. We investigate if and how current offline RL algorithms match up to this promise on diverse, challenging, previously unsolved tasks, using datasets up to 1000x larger than typical offline RL datasets. We observe that despite scaling up data, many existing offline RL algorithms exhibit poor scaling behavior, saturating well below the maximum performance. We hypothesize that the horizon is the main cause behind the poor scaling of offline RL. We empirically verify this hypothesis through several analysis experiments, showing that long horizons indeed present a fundamental barrier to scaling up offline RL. We then show that various horizon reduction techniques substantially enhance scalability on challenging tasks. Based on our insights, we also introduce a minimal yet scalable method named SHARSA that effectively reduces the horizon. SHARSA achieves the best asymptotic performance and scaling behavior among our evaluation methods, showing that explicitly reducing the horizon unlocks the scalability of offline RL.

| **[Pretraining a Shared Q-Network for Data-Efficient Offline Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05701v2)** | 2025-10-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Offline reinforcement learning (RL) aims to learn a policy from a static dataset without further interactions with the environment. Collecting sufficiently large datasets for offline RL is exhausting since this data collection requires colossus interactions with environments and becomes tricky when the interaction with the environment is restricted. Hence, how an agent learns the best policy with a minimal static dataset is a crucial issue in offline RL, similar to the sample efficiency problem in online RL. In this paper, we propose a simple yet effective plug-and-play pretraining method to initialize a feature of a Q-network to enhance data efficiency in offline RL. Specifically, we introduce a shared Q-network structure that outputs predictions of the next state and Q-value. We pretrain the shared Q-network through a supervised regression task that predicts a next state and trains the shared Q-network using diverse offline RL methods. Through extensive experiments, we empirically demonstrate that our method enhances the performance of existing popular offline RL methods on the D4RL, Robomimic and V-D4RL benchmarks. Furthermore, we show that our method significantly boosts data-efficient offline RL across various data qualities and data distributions trough D4RL and ExoRL benchmarks. Notably, our method adapted with only 10% of the dataset outperforms standard algorithms even with full datasets.</p></details> |  |
| **[Finite-Time Bounds for Average-Reward Fitted Q-Iteration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17391v1)** | 2025-10-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Although there is an extensive body of work characterizing the sample complexity of discounted-return offline RL with function approximations, prior work on the average-reward setting has received significantly less attention, and existing approaches rely on restrictive assumptions, such as ergodicity or linearity of the MDP. In this work, we establish the first sample complexity results for average-reward offline RL with function approximation for weakly communicating MDPs, a much milder assumption. To this end, we introduce Anchored Fitted Q-Iteration, which combines the standard Fitted Q-Iteration with an anchor mechanism. We show that the anchor, which can be interpreted as a form of weight decay, is crucial for enabling finite-time analysis in the average-reward setting. We also extend our finite-time analysis to the setup where the dataset is generated from a single-trajectory rather than IID transitions, again leveraging the anchor mechanism.</p></details> |  |
| **[Transfer Q-learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.04709v2)** | 2025-10-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time-inhomogeneous finite-horizon Markov decision processes (MDP) are frequently employed to model decision-making in dynamic treatment regimes and other statistical reinforcement learning (RL) scenarios. These fields, especially healthcare and business, often face challenges such as high-dimensional state spaces and time-inhomogeneity of the MDP process, compounded by insufficient sample availability which complicates informed decision-making. To overcome these challenges, we investigate knowledge transfer within time-inhomogeneous finite-horizon MDP by leveraging data from both a target RL task and several related source tasks. We have developed transfer learning (TL) algorithms that are adaptable for both batch and online $Q$-learning, integrating valuable insights from offline source studies. The proposed transfer $Q$-learning algorithm contains a novel {\em re-targeting} step that enables {\em cross-stage transfer} along multiple stages in an RL task, besides the usual {\em cross-task transfer} for supervised learning. We establish the first theoretical justifications of TL in RL tasks by showing a faster rate of convergence of the $Q^*$-function estimation in the offline RL transfer, and a lower regret bound in the offline-to-online RL transfer under stage-wise reward similarity and mild design similarity across tasks. Empirical evidence from both synthetic and real datasets is presented to evaluate the proposed algorithm and support our theoretical results.</p></details> |  |
| **[MOBODY: Model Based Off-Dynamics Offline Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08460v2)** | 2025-10-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We study off-dynamics offline reinforcement learning, where the goal is to learn a policy from offline source and limited target datasets with mismatched dynamics. Existing methods either penalize the reward or discard source transitions occurring in parts of the transition space with high dynamics shift. As a result, they optimize the policy using data from low-shift regions, limiting exploration of high-reward states in the target domain that do not fall within these regions. Consequently, such methods often fail when the dynamics shift is significant or the optimal trajectories lie outside the low-shift regions. To overcome this limitation, we propose MOBODY, a Model-Based Off-Dynamics Offline RL algorithm that optimizes a policy using learned target dynamics transitions to explore the target domain, rather than only being trained with the low dynamics-shift transitions. For the dynamics learning, built on the observation that achieving the same next state requires taking different actions in different domains, MOBODY employs separate action encoders for each domain to encode different actions to the shared latent space while sharing a unified representation of states and a common transition function. We further introduce a target Q-weighted behavior cloning loss in policy optimization to avoid out-of-distribution actions, which push the policy toward actions with high target-domain Q-values, rather than high source domain Q-values or uniformly imitating all actions in the offline dataset. We evaluate MOBODY on a wide range of MuJoCo and Adroit benchmarks, demonstrating that it outperforms state-of-the-art off-dynamics RL baselines as well as policy learning methods based on different dynamics learning baselines, with especially pronounced improvements in challenging scenarios where existing methods struggle.</p></details> |  |

Existing approaches often rely on pre-collected expert demonstrations and train policies via imitation learning (IL) or offline reinforcement learning (RL). However, obtaining high-quality demonstrations for precision tasks is difficult and time-consuming, while offline RL commonly suffers from distribution shifts and low data efficiency. We introduce a Role-Model Reinforcement Learning (RM-RL) framework that unifies online and offline training in real-world environments. The key idea is a role-model strategy that automatically generates labels for online training data using approximately optimal actions, eliminating the need for human demonstrations. RM-RL reformulates policy learning as supervised training, reducing instability from distribution mismatch and improving efficiency. A hybrid training scheme further leverages online role-model data for offline reuse, enhancing data efficiency through repeated sampling. Extensive experiments show that RM-RL converges faster and more stably than existing RL methods, yielding significant gains in real-world manipulation: 53% improvement in translation accuracy and 20% in rotation accuracy. Finally, we demonstrate the successful execution of a challenging task, precisely placing a cell plate onto a shelf, highlighting the framework's effectiveness where prior methods fail.</p></details> |  |

Through mathematical analysis, we reveal that standard SFT gradients implicitly encode a problematic reward structure that may severely restrict the generalization capabilities of model. To rectify this, we propose Dynamic Fine-Tuning (DFT), stabilizing gradient updates for each token by dynamically rescaling the objective function with the probability of this token. Remarkably, this single-line code change significantly outperforms standard SFT across multiple challenging benchmarks and base models, demonstrating greatly improved generalization. Additionally, our approach shows competitive results in offline RL settings, offering an effective yet simpler alternative. This work bridges theoretical insight and practical solutions, substantially advancing SFT performance.

In most cases, we are only given imperfect simulators with simplified dynamics, which inevitably lead to severe sim-to-real gaps in RL policy learning. The recently emerged field of offline RL provides another possibility to learn policies directly from pre-collected historical data. However, to achieve reasonable performance, existing offline RL algorithms need impractically large offline data with sufficient state-action space coverage for training. This brings up a new question: is it possible to combine learning from limited real data in offline RL and unrestricted exploration through imperfect simulators in online RL to address the drawbacks of both approaches? In this study, we propose the Dynamics-Aware Hybrid Offline-and-Online Reinforcement Learning (H2O) framework to provide an affirmative answer to this question. H2O introduces a dynamics-aware policy evaluation scheme, which adaptively penalizes the Q function learning on simulated state-action pairs with large dynamics gaps, while also simultaneously allowing learning from a fixed real-world dataset. Through extensive simulation and real-world tasks, as well as theoretical analysis, we demonstrate the superior performance of H2O against other cross-domain online and offline RL algorithms. H2O provides a brand new hybrid offline-and-online RL paradigm, which can potentially shed light on future RL algorithm design for solving practical real-world tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>NeurI...</summary><p>NeurIPS 2022 Spotlight</p></details> |
| **[Expert or not? assessing data quality in offline reinforcement learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12638v1)** | 2025-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Offline reinforcement learning (RL) learns exclusively from static datasets, without further interaction with the environment. In practice, such datasets vary widely in quality, often mixing expert, suboptimal, and even random trajectories. The choice of algorithm therefore depends on dataset fidelity. Behavior cloning can suffice on high-quality data, whereas mixed- or low-quality data typically benefits from offline RL methods that stitch useful behavior across trajectories. Yet in the wild it is difficult to assess dataset quality a priori because the data's provenance and skill composition are unknown. We address the problem of estimating offline dataset quality without training an agent. We study a spectrum of proxies from simple cumulative rewards to learned value based estimators, and introduce the Bellman Wasserstein distance (BWD), a value aware optimal transport score that measures how dissimilar a dataset's behavioral policy is from a random reference policy. BWD is computed from a behavioral critic and a state conditional OT formulation, requiring no environment interaction or full policy optimization. Across D4RL MuJoCo tasks, BWD strongly correlates with an oracle performance score that aggregates multiple offline RL algorithms, enabling efficient prediction of how well standard agents will perform on a given dataset. Beyond prediction, integrating BWD as a regularizer during policy optimization explicitly pushes the learned policy away from random behavior and improves returns. These results indicate that value aware, distributional signals such as BWD are practical tools for triaging offline RL datasets and policy optimization.</p></details> |  |

Despite its success in the single-agent setting, offline multi-agent RL remains a challenge, especially in competitive games. Firstly, unaware of the game structure, it is impossible to interact with the opponents and conduct a major learning paradigm, self-play, for competitive games. Secondly, real-world datasets cannot cover all the state and action space in the game, resulting in barriers to identifying Nash equilibrium (NE). To address these issues, this paper introduces OFF-FSP, the first practical model-free offline RL algorithm for competitive games. We start by simulating interactions with various opponents by adjusting the weights of the fixed dataset with importance sampling. This technique allows us to learn the best responses to different opponents and employ the Offline Self-Play learning framework. To overcome the challenge of partial coverage, we combine the single-agent offline RL method with Fictitious Self-Play (FSP) to approximate NE by constraining the approximate best responses away from out-of-distribution actions. Experiments on matrix games, extensive-form poker, and board games demonstrate that OFF-FSP achieves significantly lower exploitability than state-of-the-art baselines. Finally, we validate OFF-FSP on a real-world human-robot competitive task, demonstrating its potential for solving complex, hard-to-simulate real-world problems.</p></details> |  |

This analysis links transition and reward prediction losses to representation quality, yielding online, "deep" analogues of classical SPI theorems from the offline RL literature. Building on these results, we introduce DeepSPI, a principled on-policy algorithm that couples local transition and reward losses with regularised policy updates.

Bandwidth estimation for real-time communications remains an open challenge due to rapidly evolving network architectures, increasingly complex protocol stacks, and the difficulty of defining QoE metrics that reliably improve user experience. In this work, we propose a deployed, human-in-the-loop, data-driven framework for bandwidth estimation to address these challenges. Our approach begins with training objective QoE reward models derived from subjective user evaluations to measure audio and video quality in real-time video conferencing systems. Subsequently, we collect roughly $1$M network traces with objective QoE rewards from real-world Microsoft Teams calls to curate a bandwidth estimation training dataset. We then introduce a novel distributional offline reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm to train a neural-network-based bandwidth estimator aimed at improving QoE for users. Our real-world A/B test demonstrates that the proposed approach reduces the subjective poor call ratio by $11.41\%$ compared to the baseline bandwidth estimator. Furthermore, the proposed offline RL algorithm is benchmarked on D4RL tasks to demonstrate its generalization beyond bandwidth estimation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication in the proceedings of the AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence 2026 (IAAI Technical Track on Deployed Highly Innovative Applications of AI)</p></details> |

However, existing methods face a stark trade-off: slow, iterative models like diffusion policies are computationally expensive, while fast, single-step models like consistency policies often suffer from degraded performance. In this paper, we demonstrate that it is possible to bridge this gap. The key to moving beyond the limitations of individual methods, we argue, lies in a unifying perspective that views modern generative models, including diffusion, flow matching, and consistency models, as specific instances of learning a continuous-time generative trajectory governed by an Ordinary Differential Equation (ODE). This principled foundation provides a clearer design space for generative policies in RL and allows us to propose Generative Trajectory Policies (GTPs), a new and more general policy paradigm that learns the entire solution map of the underlying ODE. To make this paradigm practical for offline RL, we further introduce two key theoretically principled adaptations. Empirical results demonstrate that GTP achieves state-of-the-art performance on D4RL benchmarks - it significantly outperforms prior generative policies, achieving perfect scores on several notoriously hard AntMaze tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint.

We introduce mathematical tools for fairly analyzing policies under partial observability and revealing how agents use memory to make decisions. To utilize these tools, we present POPGym Arcade, a collection of Atari-inspired, hardware-accelerated, pixel-based environments sharing a single observation and action space. Each environment provides fully and partially observable variants, enabling counterfactual studies on observability. We find that controlled studies are necessary for fair comparisons, and identify a pathology where value functions smear credit over irrelevant history. With this pathology, we demonstrate how out-of-distribution scenarios can contaminate memory, perturbing the policy far into the future, with implications for sim-to-real transfer and offline RL.</p></details> |  |

However, existing works mainly focus on pixel-level triggers that are impractical to deploy in the real world. We address this gap by introducing a novel backdoor attack against the end-to-end AD systems that leverage one or more other vehicles' trajectories as triggers. To generate precise trigger trajectories, we first use temporal logic (TL) specifications to define the behaviors of attacker vehicles. Configurable behavior models are then used to generate these trajectories, which are quantitatively evaluated and iteratively refined based on the TL specifications. We further develop a negative training strategy by incorporating patch trajectories that are similar to triggers but are designated not to activate the backdoor. It enhances the stealthiness of the attack and refines the system's responses to trigger scenarios. Through extensive experiments on 5 offline reinforcement learning (RL) driving agents with 6 trigger patterns and target action combinations, we demonstrate the flexibility and effectiveness of our proposed attack, showing the under-exploration of existing end-to-end AD systems' vulnerabilities to such trajectory-based backdoor attacks.</p></details> |  |

However, RL has yet to be fully leveraged in robotics, principally due to its lack of scalability. Offline RL offers a promising avenue by training agents on large, diverse datasets, avoiding the costly real-world interactions of online RL. Scaling offline RL to increasingly complex datasets requires expressive generative models such as diffusion and flow matching. However, existing methods typically depend on either backpropagation through time (BPTT), which is computationally prohibitive, or policy distillation, which introduces compounding errors and limits scalability to larger base policies. In this paper, we consider the question of how to develop a scalable offline RL approach without relying on distillation or backpropagation through time. We introduce Expressive Value Learning for Offline Reinforcement Learning (EVOR): a scalable offline RL approach that integrates both expressive policies and expressive value functions. EVOR learns an optimal, regularized Q-function via flow matching during training. At inference-time, EVOR performs inference-time policy extraction via rejection sampling against the expressive value function, enabling efficient optimization, regularization, and compute-scalable search without retraining. Empirically, we show that EVOR outperforms baselines on a diverse set of offline RL tasks, demonstrating the benefit of integrating expressive value learning into offline RL.</p></details> | 24 pages, 5 figures |

However, these systems face challenges, particularly in offline settings, where data inefficiency and reliance on pre-collected trajectories limit their broader applicability. While offline reinforcement learning methods leverage extensive datasets to address these issues, they often struggle with noisy data and fail to capture long-term user preferences, resulting in suboptimal recommendation policies. To overcome these limitations, we propose Diffusion-enhanced Actor-Critic for Offline RL4RS (DAC4Rec), a novel framework that integrates diffusion processes with reinforcement learning to model complex user preferences more effectively. DAC4Rec leverages the denoising capabilities of diffusion models to enhance the robustness of offline RL algorithms and incorporates a Q-value-guided policy optimization strategy to better handle suboptimal trajectories. Additionally, we introduce an energy-based sampling strategy to reduce randomness during recommendation generation, ensuring more targeted and reliable outcomes. We validate the effectiveness of DAC4Rec through extensive experiments on six real-world offline datasets and in an online simulation environment, demonstrating its ability to optimize long-term user preferences. Furthermore, we show that the proposed diffusion policy can be seamlessly integrated into other commonly used RL algorithms in RL4RS, highlighting its versatility and wide applicability.</p></details> | CIKM'25 |

However, current approaches still struggle with complex, long-horizon sequential decision making. In this work, we introduce DEtached value learning with Action Sequence (DEAS), a simple yet effective offline RL framework that leverages action sequences for value learning. These temporally extended actions provide richer information than single-step actions and can be interpreted through the options framework via semi-Markov decision process Q-learning, enabling reduction of the effective planning horizon by considering longer sequences at once. However, directly adopting such sequences in actor-critic algorithms introduces excessive value overestimation, which we address through detached value learning that steers value estimates toward in-distribution actions that achieve high return in the offline dataset. We demonstrate that DEAS consistently outperforms baselines on complex, long-horizon tasks from OGBench and can be applied to enhance the performance of large-scale Vision-Language-Action models that predict action sequences, significantly boosting performance in both RoboCasa Kitchen simulation tasks and real-world manipulation tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project website: https://changyeon.site/deas</p></details> |
| **[PyCFRL: A Python library for counterfactually fair offline reinforcement learning via sequential data preprocessing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06935v1)** | 2025-10-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement learning (RL) aims to learn and evaluate a sequential decision rule, often referred to as a "policy", that maximizes the population-level benefit in an environment across possibly infinitely many time steps. However, the sequential decisions made by an RL algorithm, while optimized to maximize overall population benefits, may disadvantage certain individuals who are in minority or socioeconomically disadvantaged groups. To address this problem, we introduce PyCFRL, a Python library for ensuring counterfactual fairness in offline RL. PyCFRL implements a novel data preprocessing algorithm for learning counterfactually fair RL policies from offline datasets and provides tools to evaluate the values and counterfactual unfairness levels of RL policies. We describe the high-level functionalities of PyCFRL and demonstrate one of its major use cases through a data example. The library is publicly available on PyPI and Github (https://github.com/JianhanZhang/PyCFRL), and detailed tutorials can be found in the PyCFRL documentation (https://pycfrl-documentation.netlify.app).</p></details> |  |
| **[Adjusting the Output of Decision Transformer with Action Gradient](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05285v1)** | 2025-10-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Decision Transformer (DT), which integrates reinforcement learning (RL) with the transformer model, introduces a novel approach to offline RL. Unlike classical algorithms that take maximizing cumulative discounted rewards as objective, DT instead maximizes the likelihood of actions. This paradigm shift, however, presents two key challenges: stitching trajectories and extrapolation of action. Existing methods, such as substituting specific tokens with predictive values and integrating the Policy Gradient (PG) method, address these challenges individually but fail to improve performance stably when combined due to inherent instability. To address this, we propose Action Gradient (AG), an innovative methodology that directly adjusts actions to fulfill a function analogous to that of PG, while also facilitating efficient integration with token prediction techniques. AG utilizes the gradient of the Q-value with respect to the action to optimize the action. The empirical results demonstrate that our method can significantly enhance the performance of DT-based algorithms, with some results achieving state-of-the-art levels.</p></details> |  |
| **[VIPO: Value Function Inconsistency Penalized Offline Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11944v2)** | 2025-10-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Offline reinforcement learning (RL) learns effective policies from pre-collected datasets, offering a practical solution for applications where online interactions are risky or costly. Model-based approaches are particularly advantageous for offline RL, owing to their data efficiency and generalizability. However, due to inherent model errors, model-based methods often artificially introduce conservatism guided by heuristic uncertainty estimation, which can be unreliable. In this paper, we introduce VIPO, a novel model-based offline RL algorithm that incorporates self-supervised feedback from value estimation to enhance model training. Specifically, the model is learned by additionally minimizing the inconsistency between the value learned directly from the offline data and the one estimated from the model. We perform comprehensive evaluations from multiple perspectives to show that VIPO can learn a highly accurate model efficiently and consistently outperform existing methods. In particular, it achieves state-of-the-art performance on almost all tasks in both D4RL and NeoRL benchmarks. Overall, VIPO offers a general framework that can be readily integrated into existing model-based offline RL algorithms to systematically enhance model accuracy.</p></details> |  |
| **[HOFLON: Hybrid Offline Learning and Online Optimization for Process Start-Up and Grade-Transition Control](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03830v1)** | 2025-10-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Start-ups and product grade-changes are critical steps in continuous-process plant operation, because any misstep immediately affects product quality and drives operational losses. These transitions have long relied on manual operation by a handful of expert operators, but the progressive retirement of that workforce is leaving plant owners without the tacit know-how needed to execute them consistently. In the absence of a process model, offline reinforcement learning (RL) promises to capture and even surpass human expertise by mining historical start-up and grade-change logs, yet standard offline RL struggles with distribution shift and value-overestimation whenever a learned policy ventures outside the data envelope. We introduce HOFLON (Hybrid Offline Learning + Online Optimization) to overcome those limitations. Offline, HOFLON learns (i) a latent data manifold that represents the feasible region spanned by past transitions and (ii) a long-horizon Q-critic that predicts the cumulative reward from state-action pairs. Online, it solves a one-step optimization problem that maximizes the Q-critic while penalizing deviations from the learned manifold and excessive rates of change in the manipulated variables. We test HOFLON on two industrial case studies: a polymerization reactor start-up and a paper-machine grade-change problem, and benchmark it against Implicit Q-Learning (IQL), a leading offline-RL algorithm. In both plants HOFLON not only surpasses IQL but also delivers, on average, better cumulative rewards than the best start-up or grade-change observed in the historical data, demonstrating its potential to automate transition operations beyond current expert capability.</p></details> | <details><summary>31 pa...</summary><p>31 pages, 15 figures, submitted to Computers and Chemical Engineering</p></details> |

Prior work established that statistically efficient learning is impossible for either of these problems when the only assumptions are that the data has good coverage (concentrability) and the state-action value function of every policy is linearly realizable ($q^π$-realizability) (Foster et al., 2021). Recently, Tkachuk et al. (2024) gave a statistically efficient learner for policy optimization, if in addition the data is assumed to be given as trajectories. In this work we present a statistically efficient learner for policy evaluation under the same assumptions. Further, we show that the sample complexity of the learner used by Tkachuk et al. (2024) for policy optimization can be improved by a tighter analysis.</p></details> |  |
| **[Use the Online Network If You Can: Towards Fast and Stable Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02590v1)** | 2025-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The use of target networks is a popular approach for estimating value functions in deep Reinforcement Learning (RL). While effective, the target network remains a compromise solution that preserves stability at the cost of slowly moving targets, thus delaying learning. Conversely, using the online network as a bootstrapped target is intuitively appealing, albeit well-known to lead to unstable learning. In this work, we aim to obtain the best out of both worlds by introducing a novel update rule that computes the target using the MINimum estimate between the Target and Online network, giving rise to our method, MINTO. Through this simple, yet effective modification, we show that MINTO enables faster and stable value function learning, by mitigating the potential overestimation bias of using the online network for bootstrapping. Notably, MINTO can be seamlessly integrated into a wide range of value-based and actor-critic algorithms with a negligible cost. We evaluate MINTO extensively across diverse benchmarks, spanning online and offline RL, as well as discrete and continuous action spaces. Across all benchmarks, MINTO consistently improves performance, demonstrating its broad applicability and effectiveness.</p></details> |  |
| **[Enhanced DACER Algorithm with High Diffusion Efficiency](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23426v2)** | 2025-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Due to their expressive capacity, diffusion models have shown great promise in offline RL and imitation learning. Diffusion Actor-Critic with Entropy Regulator (DACER) extended this capability to online RL by using the reverse diffusion process as a policy approximator, achieving state-of-the-art performance. However, it still suffers from a core trade-off: more diffusion steps ensure high performance but reduce efficiency, while fewer steps degrade performance. This remains a major bottleneck for deploying diffusion policies in real-time online RL. To mitigate this, we propose DACERv2, which leverages a Q-gradient field objective with respect to action as an auxiliary optimization target to guide the denoising process at each diffusion step, thereby introducing intermediate supervisory signals that enhance the efficiency of single-step diffusion. Additionally, we observe that the independence of the Q-gradient field from the diffusion time step is inconsistent with the characteristics of the diffusion process. To address this issue, a temporal weighting mechanism is introduced, allowing the model to effectively eliminate large-scale noise during the early stages and refine its outputs in the later stages. Experimental results on OpenAI Gym benchmarks and multimodal tasks demonstrate that, compared with classical and diffusion-based online RL algorithms, DACERv2 achieves higher performance in most complex control environments with only five diffusion steps and shows greater multimodality.</p></details> |  |
| **[Density-Ratio Weighted Behavioral Cloning: Learning Control Policies from Corrupted Datasets](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01479v1)** | 2025-10-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Offline reinforcement learning (RL) enables policy optimization from fixed datasets, making it suitable for safety-critical applications where online exploration is infeasible. However, these datasets are often contaminated by adversarial poisoning, system errors, or low-quality samples, leading to degraded policy performance in standard behavioral cloning (BC) and offline RL methods. This paper introduces Density-Ratio Weighted Behavioral Cloning (Weighted BC), a robust imitation learning approach that uses a small, verified clean reference set to estimate trajectory-level density ratios via a binary discriminator. These ratios are clipped and used as weights in the BC objective to prioritize clean expert behavior while down-weighting or discarding corrupted data, without requiring knowledge of the contamination mechanism. We establish theoretical guarantees showing convergence to the clean expert policy with finite-sample bounds that are independent of the contamination rate. A comprehensive evaluation framework is established, which incorporates various poisoning protocols (reward, state, transition, and action) on continuous control benchmarks. Experiments demonstrate that Weighted BC maintains near-optimal performance even at high contamination ratios outperforming baselines such as traditional BC, batch-constrained Q-learning (BCQ) and behavior regularized actor-critic (BRAC).</p></details> |  |
| **[DiSA-IQL: Offline Reinforcement Learning for Robust Soft Robot Control under Distribution Shifts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00358v1)** | 2025-09-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Soft snake robots offer remarkable flexibility and adaptability in complex environments, yet their control remains challenging due to highly nonlinear dynamics. Existing model-based and bio-inspired controllers rely on simplified assumptions that limit performance. Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has recently emerged as a promising alternative, but online training is often impractical because of costly and potentially damaging real-world interactions. Offline RL provides a safer option by leveraging pre-collected datasets, but it suffers from distribution shift, which degrades generalization to unseen scenarios. To overcome this challenge, we propose DiSA-IQL (Distribution-Shift-Aware Implicit Q-Learning), an extension of IQL that incorporates robustness modulation by penalizing unreliable state-action pairs to mitigate distribution shift. We evaluate DiSA-IQL on goal-reaching tasks across two settings: in-distribution and out-of-distribution evaluation. Simulation results show that DiSA-IQL consistently outperforms baseline models, including Behavior Cloning (BC), Conservative Q-Learning (CQL), and vanilla IQL, achieving higher success rates, smoother trajectories, and improved robustness. The codes are open-sourced to support reproducibility and to facilitate further research in offline RL for soft robot control.</p></details> |  |
| **[In-Context Compositional Q-Learning for Offline Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24067v1)** | 2025-09-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurately estimating the Q-function is a central challenge in offline reinforcement learning. However, existing approaches often rely on a single global Q-function, which struggles to capture the compositional nature of tasks involving diverse subtasks. We propose In-context Compositional Q-Learning (\texttt{ICQL}), the first offline RL framework that formulates Q-learning as a contextual inference problem, using linear Transformers to adaptively infer local Q-functions from retrieved transitions without explicit subtask labels. Theoretically, we show that under two assumptions--linear approximability of the local Q-function and accurate weight inference from retrieved context--\texttt{ICQL} achieves bounded Q-function approximation error, and supports near-optimal policy extraction. Empirically, \texttt{ICQL} substantially improves performance in offline settings: improving performance in kitchen tasks by up to 16.4\%, and in Gym and Adroit tasks by up to 8.6\% and 6.3\%. These results highlight the underexplored potential of in-context learning for robust and compositional value estimation, positioning \texttt{ICQL} as a principled and effective framework for offline RL.</p></details> |  |
| **[Double Check My Desired Return: Transformer with Target Alignment for Offline Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16420v2)** | 2025-09-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Offline reinforcement learning (RL) has achieved significant advances in domains such as robotic control, autonomous driving, and medical decision-making. Most existing methods primarily focus on training policies that maximize cumulative returns from a given dataset. However, many real-world applications require precise control over policy performance levels, rather than simply pursuing the best possible return. Reinforcement learning via supervised learning (RvS) frames offline RL as a sequence modeling task, enabling the extraction of diverse policies by conditioning on different desired returns. Yet, existing RvS-based transformers, such as Decision Transformer (DT), struggle to reliably align the actual achieved returns with specified target returns, especially when interpolating within underrepresented returns or extrapolating beyond the dataset. To address this limitation, we propose Doctor, a novel approach that Double Checks the Transformer with target alignment for Offline RL. Doctor integrates the strengths of supervised learning (SL) and temporal difference (TD) learning by jointly optimizing the action prediction and value estimation. During inference, Doctor introduces a double-check mechanism: actions are first sampled around the desired target returns and then validated with value functions. This ensures more accurate alignment between predicted actions and desired target returns. We evaluate Doctor on the D4RL and EpiCare benchmarks, demonstrating aligned control yields stronger performance and tunable expertise, showing its effectiveness in a wide range of tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Multi-Agent Path Finding via Offline RL and LLM Collaboration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22130v1)** | 2025-09-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-Agent Path Finding (MAPF) poses a significant and challenging problem critical for applications in robotics and logistics, particularly due to its combinatorial complexity and the partial observability inherent in realistic environments. Decentralized reinforcement learning methods commonly encounter two substantial difficulties: first, they often yield self-centered behaviors among agents, resulting in frequent collisions, and second, their reliance on complex communication modules leads to prolonged training times, sometimes spanning weeks. To address these challenges, we propose an efficient decentralized planning framework based on the Decision Transformer (DT), uniquely leveraging offline reinforcement learning to substantially reduce training durations from weeks to mere hours. Crucially, our approach effectively handles long-horizon credit assignment and significantly improves performance in scenarios with sparse and delayed rewards. Furthermore, to overcome adaptability limitations inherent in standard RL methods under dynamic environmental changes, we integrate a large language model (GPT-4o) to dynamically guide agent policies. Extensive experiments in both static and dynamically changing environments demonstrate that our DT-based approach, augmented briefly by GPT-4o, significantly enhances adaptability and performance.</p></details> |  |

However, existing approaches typically assume a fixed two-layer diffusion hierarchy with a single predefined temporal scale, which limits adaptability to diverse downstream tasks and reduces flexibility in decision making. In this work, we propose SIHD, a novel Structural Information-based Hierarchical Diffusion framework for effective and stable offline policy learning in long-horizon environments with sparse rewards. Specifically, we analyze structural information embedded in offline trajectories to construct the diffusion hierarchy adaptively, enabling flexible trajectory modeling across multiple temporal scales. Rather than relying on reward predictions from localized sub-trajectories, we quantify the structural information gain of each state community and use it as a conditioning signal within the corresponding diffusion layer. To reduce overreliance on offline datasets, we introduce a structural entropy regularizer that encourages exploration of underrepresented states while avoiding extrapolation errors from distributional shifts. Extensive evaluations on challenging offline RL tasks show that SIHD significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in decision-making performance and demonstrates superior generalization across diverse scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by NeurIPS 2025</p></details> |

This study introduces GNN-DT, a novel Decision Transformer (DT) architecture that integrates Graph Neural Network (GNN) embedders with a novel residual connection between input and output tokens crucial for handling dynamic environments. By learning from previously collected trajectories, GNN-DT tackles the sparse rewards limitations of online RL algorithms and delivers high-quality solutions in real-time. We evaluate GNN-DT on the complex electric vehicle (EV) charging optimization problem and prove that its performance is superior and requires significantly fewer training trajectories, thus improving sample efficiency compared to existing DT and offline RL baselines. Furthermore, GNN-DT exhibits robust generalization to unseen environments and larger action spaces, addressing a critical gap in prior offline and online RL approaches.</p></details> |  |

In many of these problems, the reward function is verifiable, a setting termed RL with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR). We apply RLVR to a popular data science benchmark called BIRD that measures the ability of an AI agent to convert a natural language query for a database to SQL executions. We apply a simple and general-purpose training recipe involving careful prompt and model selection, a warm-up stage using our offline RL approach called TAO, followed by rigorous online RLVR training. With no additional training data beyond the BIRD training set and no use of proprietary models, our very first submission to the BIRD leaderboard reached state-of-the-art accuracy on the private test set: 73.56% without self-consistency and 75.68% with self-consistency. In the latter case, our model also required fewer generations than the second-best approach. While BIRD is only a proxy task, the simplicity of our framework makes it broadly applicable to enterprise domains such as business intelligence, data science, and coding.</p></details> |  |
| **[UI-S1: Advancing GUI Automation via Semi-online Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11543v2)** | 2025-09-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graphical User Interface (GUI) agents have demonstrated remarkable progress in automating complex user interface interactions through reinforcement learning. However, current approaches face a fundamental dilemma: offline RL enables stable training on pre-collected trajectories, but struggles with multi-step task execution for lack of trajectory-level reward signals; online RL captures these signals through environment interaction, but suffers from sparse rewards and prohibitive deployment costs. To address it, we present Semi-online Reinforcement Learning, a novel paradigm that simulates online RL on offline trajectories. During each rollout process, we preserve the original model output within the multi-turn dialogue, where a Patch Module adaptively recovers the divergence between rollout and expert trajectories. To capture long-term training signals, Semi-online RL introduces discounted future returns into the reward computation and optimizes the policy with weighted step-level and episode-level advantages. We further introduce Semi-Online Performance (SOP), a metric that aligns better with true online performance, serving as a practical and effective proxy for real-world evaluation. Experiments show that ours Semi-online RL achieves SOTA performance among 7B models across four dynamic benchmarks, with significant gains over the base model (e.g., +12.0% on AndroidWorld, +23.8% on AITW), demonstrating significant progress in bridging the gap between offline training efficiency and online multi-turn reasoning.

Recently, to optimize long-term user satisfaction, Reinforcement Learning (RL) is used for MTF in RSs. However, the existing offline RL algorithms used for MTF have the following severe problems: a) To avoid Out-of-Distribution (OOD), their constraints are overly strict, which seriously damage performance; b) They are unaware of the exploration policy used to collect training data, only suboptimal policy can be learned; c) Their exploration policies are inefficient and hurt user experience. To solve the above problems, we propose an innovative method called UnifiedRL tailored for MTF in large-scale RSs. UnifiedRL seamlessly integrates offline RL model with its custom exploration policy to relax overly strict constraints, which is different from existing RL-MTF methods and significantly improves performance. In addition, compared to existing exploration policies, UnifiedRL's custom exploration policy is highly efficient, enabling frequent online exploration and offline training iterations, which further improves performance. Extensive offline and online experiments are conducted in a large-scale RS. The results demonstrate that UnifiedRL outperforms other existing MTF methods remarkably, achieving a +4.64% increase in user valid consumption and a +1.74% increase in user duration time. To the best of our knowledge, UnifiedRL is the first RL algorithm tailored for MTF in RSs and has been successfully deployed in multiple large-scale RSs since June 2023, yielding significant benefits.</p></details> |  |

However, trajectory-wise preference labels are difficult to meet the precise learning of step-wise reward, thereby affecting the performance of downstream algorithms. To alleviate the insufficient step-wise reward caused by trajectory-wise preferences, we propose a novel preference-based reward acquisition method: Diffusion Preference-based Reward (DPR). DPR directly treats step-wise preference-based reward acquisition as a binary classification and utilizes the robustness of diffusion classifiers to infer step-wise rewards discriminatively. In addition, to further utilize trajectory-wise preference information, we propose Conditional Diffusion Preference-based Reward (C-DPR), which conditions on trajectory-wise preference labels to enhance reward inference. We apply the above methods to existing offline RL algorithms, and a series of experimental results demonstrate that the diffusion classifier-driven reward outperforms the previous reward acquisition method with the Bradley-Terry model.</p></details> |  |

Dynamic programming methods are the most widely used and form the foundation of both classical and modern reinforcement learning (RL). By contrast, LP-based methods have been less commonly employed, although they have recently gained attention in contexts such as offline RL. The relative underuse of the LP-based methods stems from the fact that it leads to an inequality-constrained optimization problem, which is generally more challenging to solve effectively compared with Bellman-equation-based methods. The purpose of this paper is to establish a theoretical foundation for solving LP-based MDPs in a more effective and practical manner. Our key idea is to leverage the log-barrier function, widely used in inequality-constrained optimization, to transform the LP formulation of the MDP into an unconstrained optimization problem. This reformulation enables approximate solutions to be obtained easily via gradient descent. While the method may appear simple, to the best of our knowledge, a thorough theoretical interpretation of this approach has not yet been developed. This paper aims to bridge this gap.</p></details> |  |

However, these datasets and their task designs often lack systematic consideration and principles. This raises important questions: Do the current datasets and task designs truly advance the capabilities of robotic agents? Do evaluations on a few common tasks accurately reflect the differentiated performance of various methods proposed by different teams and evaluated on different tasks? To address these issues, we introduce the Great March 100 (\textbf{GM-100}) as the first step towards a robot learning Olympics. GM-100 consists of 100 carefully designed tasks that cover a wide range of interactions and long-tail behaviors, aiming to provide a diverse and challenging set of tasks to comprehensively evaluate the capabilities of robotic agents and promote diversity and complexity in robot dataset task designs. These tasks are developed through systematic analysis and expansion of existing task designs, combined with insights from human-object interaction primitives and object affordances. We collect a large amount of trajectory data on different robotic platforms and evaluate several baseline models. Experimental results demonstrate that the GM-100 tasks are 1) feasible to execute and 2) sufficiently challenging to effectively differentiate the performance of current VLA models. Our data and code are available at https://rhos.ai/research/gm-100.</p></details> |  |

This paper introduces a comprehensive dynamics dataset for the Mini Wheelbot, an open-source, quasi-symmetric balancing reaction wheel unicycle. The dataset provides 1 kHz synchronized data encompassing all onboard sensor readings, state estimates, ground-truth poses from a motion capture system, and third-person video logs. To ensure data diversity, we include experiments across multiple hardware instances and surfaces using various control paradigms, including pseudo-random binary excitation, nonlinear model predictive control, and reinforcement learning agents. We include several example applications in dynamics model learning, state estimation, and time-series classification to illustrate common robotics algorithms that can be benchmarked on our dataset.</p></details> |  |

However, their significant data requirements present a major challenge in the data-scarce context of most robotic learning settings, where compact CNNs with strong inductive biases can be more easily optimized. To address this trade-off, we introduce X-Distill, a simple yet highly effective method that synergizes the strengths of both architectures. Our approach involves an offline, cross-architecture knowledge distillation, transferring the rich visual representations of a large, frozen DINOv2 teacher to a compact ResNet-18 student on the general-purpose ImageNet dataset. This distilled encoder, now endowed with powerful visual priors, is then jointly fine-tuned with a diffusion policy head on the target manipulation tasks. Extensive experiments on $34$ simulated benchmarks and $5$ challenging real-world tasks demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms policies equipped with from-scratch ResNet or fine-tuned DINOv2 encoders. Notably, X-Distill also surpasses 3D encoders that utilize privileged point cloud observations or much larger Vision-Language Models.

However, existing generative approaches often fail to capture the functional complexity of real-world interiors, particularly those containing articulated objects with movable parts essential for manipulation and navigation. This paper presents SceneFoundry, a language-guided diffusion framework that generates apartment-scale 3D worlds with functionally articulated furniture and semantically diverse layouts for robotic training. From natural language prompts, an LLM module controls floor layout generation, while diffusion-based posterior sampling efficiently populates the scene with articulated assets from large-scale 3D repositories. To ensure physical usability, SceneFoundry employs differentiable guidance functions to regulate object quantity, prevent articulation collisions, and maintain sufficient walkable space for robotic navigation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our framework generates structurally valid, semantically coherent, and functionally interactive environments across diverse scene types and conditions, enabling scalable embodied AI research. project page: https://anc891203.github.io/SceneFoundry-Demo/</p></details> | 15 pages |

Though popular, they are primarily trained via supervised fine-tuning or training-time reinforcement learning, requiring explicit fine-tuning phases, human interventions, or controlled data collection. Consequently, existing methods remain unsuitable for challenging simulated- or physical-world deployments, where robots must respond autonomously and flexibly to evolving environments. To address this limitation, we introduce a Test-Time Reinforcement Learning for VLAs (TT-VLA), a framework that enables on-the-fly policy adaptation during inference. TT-VLA formulates a dense reward mechanism that leverages step-by-step task-progress signals to refine action policies during test time while preserving the SFT/RL-trained priors, making it an effective supplement to current VLA models. Empirical results show that our approach enhances overall adaptability, stability, and task success in dynamic, previously unseen scenarios under simulated and real-world settings. We believe TT-VLA offers a principled step toward self-improving, deployment-ready VLAs.</p></details> |  |
| **[iTeach: Interactive Teaching for Robot Perception using Mixed Reality](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09072v3)** | 2026-01-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Robots deployed in the wild often encounter objects and scenes that break pre-trained perception models, yet adapting these models typically requires slow offline data collection, labeling, and retraining. We introduce iTeach, a human-in-the-loop system that enables robots to improve perception continuously as they explore new environments. A human sees the robot's predictions from its own viewpoint, corrects failures in real time, and the informed data drives iterative fine-tuning until performance is satisfactory. A mixed reality headset provides the interface, overlaying predictions in the user's view and enabling lightweight annotation via eye gaze and voice. Instead of tedious frame-by-frame labeling, a human guides the robot to scenes of choice and records short videos while interacting with objects. The human labels only the final frame, and a video segmentation model propagates labels across the sequence, converting seconds of input into dense supervision. The refined model is deployed immediately, closing the loop between human feedback and robot learning. We demonstrate iTeach on Unseen Object Instance Segmentation (UOIS), achieving consistent improvements over a pre-trained MSMFormer baseline on both our collected dataset and the SceneReplica benchmark, where it leads to higher grasping success, followed by a real-world demonstration of grasping unseen objects with a Fetch robot. By combining human judgment, efficient annotation, and on-the-fly refinement, iTeach provides a practical path toward perception systems that generalize robustly in diverse real-world conditions.

However, bringing robot learning to the level of generality required for effective real-world systems faces major obstacles in terms of data, generalization, and robustness. In this paper, we discuss how generalist robot policies (i.e., robot foundation models) can address these challenges, and how we can design effective generalist robot policies for complex and highly dexterous tasks. We propose a novel flow matching architecture built on top of a pre-trained vision-language model (VLM) to inherit Internet-scale semantic knowledge. We then discuss how this model can be trained on a large and diverse dataset from multiple dexterous robot platforms, including single-arm robots, dual-arm robots, and mobile manipulators. We evaluate our model in terms of its ability to perform tasks in zero shot after pre-training, follow language instructions from people and from a high-level VLM policy, and its ability to acquire new skills via fine-tuning. Our results cover a wide variety of tasks, such as laundry folding, table cleaning, and assembling boxes.</p></details> | <details><summary>See p...</summary><p>See project website for videos: https://physicalintelligence.company/blog/pi0 Published in RSS 2025</p></details> |
| **[RoboReward: General-Purpose Vision-Language Reward Models for Robotics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00675v2)** | 2026-01-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A well-designed reward is critical for effective reinforcement learning-based policy improvement. In real-world robotics, obtaining such rewards typically requires either labor-intensive human labeling or brittle, handcrafted objectives. Vision-language models (VLMs) have shown promise as automatic reward models, yet their effectiveness on real robot tasks is poorly understood. In this work, we aim to close this gap by introducing (1) RoboReward, a robotics reward dataset and benchmark built on large-scale real-robot corpora from Open X-Embodiment (OXE) and RoboArena, and (2) vision-language reward models trained on this dataset (RoboReward 4B/8B). Because OXE is success-heavy and lacks failure examples, we propose a negative examples data augmentation pipeline that generates calibrated negative and near-misses via counterfactual relabeling of successful episodes and temporal clipping to create partial-progress outcomes from the same videos. Using this framework, we build a large training and evaluation dataset spanning diverse tasks and embodiments to test whether state-of-the-art VLMs can reliably provide rewards for robot learning. Our evaluation of open and proprietary VLMs finds that no model excels across tasks, highlighting substantial room for improvement. We then train general-purpose 4B- and 8B-parameter models that outperform much larger VLMs in assigning rewards for short-horizon robotic tasks. Finally, we deploy the 8B model in real-robot reinforcement learning and find that it improves policy learning over Gemini Robotics-ER 1.5 while narrowing the gap to RL training with human-provided rewards. We release the full dataset, trained reward models, and evaluation suite on our website to advance the development of general-purpose reward models in robotics: https://crfm.stanford.edu/helm/robo-reward-bench (project website).</p></details> |  |

| **[Genie Sim 3.0 : A High-Fidelity Comprehensive Simulation Platform for Humanoid Robot](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02078v1)** | 2026-01-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The development of robust and generalizable robot learning models is critically contingent upon the availability of large-scale, diverse training data and reliable evaluation benchmarks. Collecting data in the physical world poses prohibitive costs and scalability challenges, and prevailing simulation benchmarks frequently suffer from fragmentation, narrow scope, or insufficient fidelity to enable effective sim-to-real transfer. To address these challenges, we introduce Genie Sim 3.0, a unified simulation platform for robotic manipulation. We present Genie Sim Generator, a large language model (LLM)-powered tool that constructs high-fidelity scenes from natural language instructions. Its principal strength resides in rapid and multi-dimensional generalization, facilitating the synthesis of diverse environments to support scalable data collection and robust policy evaluation. We introduce the first benchmark that pioneers the application of LLM for automated evaluation. It leverages LLM to mass-generate evaluation scenarios and employs Vision-Language Model (VLM) to establish an automated assessment pipeline. We also release an open-source dataset comprising more than 10,000 hours of synthetic data across over 200 tasks. Through systematic experimentation, we validate the robust zero-shot sim-to-real transfer capability of our open-source dataset, demonstrating that synthetic data can server as an effective substitute for real-world data under controlled conditions for scalable policy training.

| **[Learning Diffusion Policy from Primitive Skills for Robot Manipulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01948v1)** | 2026-01-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion policies (DP) have recently shown great promise for generating actions in robotic manipulation. However, existing approaches often rely on global instructions to produce short-term control signals, which can result in misalignment in action generation. We conjecture that the primitive skills, referred to as fine-grained, short-horizon manipulations, such as ``move up'' and ``open the gripper'', provide a more intuitive and effective interface for robot learning. To bridge this gap, we propose SDP, a skill-conditioned DP that integrates interpretable skill learning with conditional action planning. SDP abstracts eight reusable primitive skills across tasks and employs a vision-language model to extract discrete representations from visual observations and language instructions. Based on them, a lightweight router network is designed to assign a desired primitive skill for each state, which helps construct a single-skill policy to generate skill-aligned actions. By decomposing complex tasks into a sequence of primitive skills and selecting a single-skill policy, SDP ensures skill-consistent behavior across diverse tasks. Extensive experiments on two challenging simulation benchmarks and real-world robot deployments demonstrate that SDP consistently outperforms SOTA methods, providing a new paradigm for skill-based robot learning with diffusion policies.</p></details> | Accepted to AAAI2026 |
| **[A Review of Online Diffusion Policy RL Algorithms for Scalable Robotic Control](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06133v1)** | 2026-01-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion policies have emerged as a powerful approach for robotic control, demonstrating superior expressiveness in modeling multimodal action distributions compared to conventional policy networks. However, their integration with online reinforcement learning remains challenging due to fundamental incompatibilities between diffusion model training objectives and standard RL policy improvement mechanisms. This paper presents the first comprehensive review and empirical analysis of current Online Diffusion Policy Reinforcement Learning (Online DPRL) algorithms for scalable robotic control systems. We propose a novel taxonomy that categorizes existing approaches into four distinct families -- Action-Gradient, Q-Weighting, Proximity-Based, and Backpropagation Through Time (BPTT) methods -- based on their policy improvement mechanisms. Through extensive experiments on a unified NVIDIA Isaac Lab benchmark encompassing 12 diverse robotic tasks, we systematically evaluate representative algorithms across five critical dimensions: task diversity, parallelization capability, diffusion step scalability, cross-embodiment generalization, and environmental robustness. Our analysis identifies key findings regarding the fundamental trade-offs inherent in each algorithmic family, particularly concerning sample efficiency and scalability. Furthermore, we reveal critical computational and algorithmic bottlenecks that currently limit the practical deployment of online DPRL. Based on these findings, we provide concrete guidelines for algorithm selection tailored to specific operational constraints and outline promising future research directions to advance the field toward more general and scalable robotic learning systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[H2R: A Human-to-Robot Data Augmentation for Robot Pre-training from Videos](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11920v3)** | 2026-01-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large-scale pre-training using videos has proven effective for robot learning. However, the models pre-trained on such data can be suboptimal for robot learning due to the significant visual gap between human hands and those of different robots. To remedy this, we propose H2R, a simple data augmentation technique that detects human hand keypoints, synthesizes robot motions in simulation, and composites rendered robots into egocentric videos. This process explicitly bridges the visual gap between human and robot embodiments during pre-training. We apply H2R to augment large-scale egocentric human video datasets such as Ego4D and SSv2, replacing human hands with simulated robotic arms to generate robot-centric training data. Based on this, we construct and release a family of 1M-scale datasets covering multiple robot embodiments (UR5 with gripper/Leaphand, Franka) and data sources (SSv2, Ego4D). To verify the effectiveness of the augmentation pipeline, we introduce a CLIP-based image-text similarity metric that quantitatively evaluates the semantic fidelity of robot-rendered frames to the original human actions. We validate H2R across three simulation benchmarks: Robomimic, RLBench and PushT and real-world manipulation tasks with a UR5 robot equipped with Gripper and Leaphand end-effectors. H2R consistently improves downstream success rates, yielding gains of 5.0%-10.2% in simulation and 6.7%-23.3% in real-world tasks across various visual encoders and policy learning methods. These results indicate that H2R improves the generalization ability of robotic policies by mitigating the visual discrepancies between human and robot domains.</p></details> |  |
| **[PolaRiS: Scalable Real-to-Sim Evaluations for Generalist Robot Policies](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16881v2)** | 2025-12-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A significant challenge for robot learning research is our ability to accurately measure and compare the performance of robot policies. Benchmarking in robotics is historically challenging due to the stochasticity, reproducibility, and time-consuming nature of real-world rollouts. This challenge is exacerbated for recent generalist policies, which has to be evaluated across a wide variety of scenes and tasks. Evaluation in simulation offers a scalable complement to real world evaluations, but the visual and physical domain gap between existing simulation benchmarks and the real world has made them an unreliable signal for policy improvement. Furthermore, building realistic and diverse simulated environments has traditionally required significant human effort and expertise. To bridge the gap, we introduce Policy Evaluation and Environment Reconstruction in Simulation (PolaRiS), a scalable real-to-sim framework for high-fidelity simulated robot evaluation. PolaRiS utilizes neural reconstruction methods to turn short video scans of real-world scenes into interactive simulation environments. Additionally, we develop a simple simulation data co-training recipe that bridges remaining real-to-sim gaps and enables zero-shot evaluation in unseen simulation environments. Through extensive paired evaluations between simulation and the real world, we demonstrate that PolaRiS evaluations provide a much stronger correlation to real world generalist policy performance than existing simulated benchmarks. Its simplicity also enables rapid creation of diverse simulated environments. As such, this work takes a step towards distributed and democratized evaluation for the next generation of robotic foundation models.</p></details> | <details><summary>Websi...</summary><p>Website: https://polaris-evals.github.io/</p></details> |

As a result, collaborative robots, despite their advanced sensing and control capabilities, are rarely used for surface finishing in small-scale craft and manufacturing settings. To address this gap, we propose a novel robot programming approach that enables non-experts to intuitively program robots through interactive, task-focused workflows. For that, we developed a new surface segmentation algorithm that incorporates human input to identify and refine workpiece regions for processing. Throughout the programming process, users receive continuous visual feedback on the robot's learned model, enabling them to iteratively refine the segmentation result. Based on the segmented surface model, a robot trajectory is generated to cover the desired processing area. We evaluated multiple interaction designs across two comprehensive user studies to derive an optimal interface that significantly reduces user workload, improves usability and enables effective task programming even for users with limited practical experience.</p></details> | <details><summary>Curre...</summary><p>Currently under review at Intelligent Service Robotics</p></details> |

An Unexplored Human Feedback Signal for Teaching Robots](https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06459v2)** | 2025-12-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Enhancing the expressiveness of human teaching is vital for both improving robots' learning from humans and the human-teaching-robot experience. In this work, we characterize and test a little-used teaching signal: \textit{progress}, designed to represent the completion percentage of a task. We conducted two online studies with 76 crowd-sourced participants and one public space study with 40 non-expert participants to validate the capability of this progress signal. We find that progress indicates whether the task is successfully performed, reflects the degree of task completion, identifies unproductive but harmless behaviors, and is likely to be more consistent across participants. Furthermore, our results show that giving progress does not require extra workload and time. An additional contribution of our work is a dataset of 40 non-expert demonstrations from the public space study through an ice cream topping-adding task, which we observe to be multi-policy and sub-optimal, with sub-optimality not only from teleoperation errors but also from exploratory actions and attempts.

The proposed method integrates two complementary modules: an error-based selection module utilizing photometric and structural similarity (SSIM) errors, and a momentum-based update module that dynamically adjusts keyframe selection thresholds according to scene motion dynamics. By dynamically curating the most informative frames, our approach addresses a key data bottleneck in real-time perception. This allows for the creation of high-quality 3D world representations from a compressed data stream, a critical step towards scalable robot learning and deployment in complex, dynamic environments. Experimental results demonstrate significant improvements over traditional static keyframe selection strategies, such as fixed temporal intervals or uniform frame skipping. These findings highlight a meaningful advancement toward adaptive perception systems that can dynamically respond to complex and evolving visual scenes. We evaluate our proposed adaptive keyframe selection module on two recent state-of-the-art 3D reconstruction networks, Spann3r and CUT3R, and observe consistent improvements in reconstruction quality across both frameworks. Furthermore, an extensive ablation study confirms the effectiveness of each individual component in our method, underlining their contribution to the overall performance gains.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ROBOVIS 2026</p></details> |

We present Egocentric Mobile MAnipulation (EMMA), an end-to-end framework training mobile manipulation policies from human mobile manipulation data with static robot data, sidestepping mobile teleoperation. To accomplish this, we co-train human full-body motion data with static robot data. In our experiments across three real-world tasks, EMMA demonstrates comparable performance to baselines trained on teleoperated mobile robot data (Mobile ALOHA), achieving higher or equivalent task performance in full task success. We find that EMMA is able to generalize to new spatial configurations and scenes, and we observe positive performance scaling as we increase the hours of human data, opening new avenues for scalable robotic learning in real-world environments.

We introduce Compliant Residual DAgger (CR-DAgger), which contains two novel components: 1) a Compliant Intervention Interface that leverages compliance control, allowing humans to provide gentle, accurate delta action corrections without interrupting the ongoing robot policy execution; and 2) a Compliant Residual Policy formulation that learns from human corrections while incorporating force feedback and force control. Our system significantly enhances performance on precise contact-rich manipulation tasks using minimal correction data, improving base policy success rates by 64% on four challenging tasks (book flipping, belt assembly, cable routing, and gear insertion) while outperforming both retraining-from-scratch and finetuning approaches. Through extensive real-world experiments, we provide practical guidance for implementing effective DAgger in real-world robot learning tasks.

Assuming the optimality of human demonstrations is core to existing VLA policies. However, we claim that in highly dexterous and precise manipulation tasks, human demonstrations are noisy and suboptimal. GR-RL proposes a multi-stage training pipeline that filters, augments, and reinforces the demonstrations by reinforcement learning. First, GR-RL learns a vision-language-conditioned task progress, filters the demonstration trajectories, and only keeps the transitions that contribute positively to the progress. Specifically, we show that by directly applying offline RL with sparse reward, the resulting $Q$-values can be treated as a robust progress function. Next, we introduce morphological symmetry augmentation that greatly improves the generalization and performance of GR-RL. Lastly, to better align the VLA policy with its deployment behaviors for high-precision control, we perform online RL by learning a latent space noise predictor. With this pipeline, GR-RL is, to our knowledge, the first learning-based policy that can autonomously lace up a shoe by threading shoelaces through multiple eyelets with an 83.3% success rate, a task requiring long-horizon reasoning, millimeter-level precision, and compliant soft-body interaction. We hope GR-RL provides a step toward enabling generalist robot foundation models to specialize into reliable real-world experts.</p></details> |  |

To reduce repetitive data collection, we present Real2Edit2Real, a framework that generates new demonstrations by bridging 3D editability with 2D visual data through a 3D control interface. Our approach first reconstructs scene geometry from multi-view RGB observations with a metric-scale 3D reconstruction model. Based on the reconstructed geometry, we perform depth-reliable 3D editing on point clouds to generate new manipulation trajectories while geometrically correcting the robot poses to recover physically consistent depth, which serves as a reliable condition for synthesizing new demonstrations. Finally, we propose a multi-conditional video generation model guided by depth as the primary control signal, together with action, edge, and ray maps, to synthesize spatially augmented multi-view manipulation videos. Experiments on four real-world manipulation tasks demonstrate that policies trained on data generated from only 1-5 source demonstrations can match or outperform those trained on 50 real-world demonstrations, improving data efficiency by up to 10-50x. Moreover, experimental results on height and texture editing demonstrate the framework's flexibility and extensibility, indicating its potential to serve as a unified data generation framework.</p></details> |  |

However, reliance on expensive real-world data limits progress. Simulators offer cost-effective alternatives, but the gap between simulation and reality challenges effective policy transfer. This paper introduces TwinAligner, a novel Real2Sim2Real system that addresses both visual and dynamic gaps. The visual alignment module achieves pixel-level alignment through SDF reconstruction and editable 3DGS rendering, while the dynamic alignment module ensures dynamic consistency by identifying rigid physics from robot-object interaction. TwinAligner improves robot learning by providing scalable data collection and establishing a trustworthy iterative cycle, accelerating algorithm development. Quantitative evaluations highlight TwinAligner's strong capabilities in visual and dynamic real-to-sim alignment. This system enables policies trained in simulation to achieve strong zero-shot generalization to the real world. The high consistency between real-world and simulated policy performance underscores TwinAligner's potential to advance scalable robot learning.

This design allows training the planner on action-free or even non-robot data sources (e.g., videos), providing transferable high-level guidance. Nevertheless, grounding these high-level plans into executable actions remains challenging, especially with the limited availability of high-quality robot data. To this end, we propose to improve the low-level policy through online interactions. Specifically, our approach collects online rollouts, retrospectively annotates the corresponding high-level goals from achieved outcomes, and aggregates these hindsight-relabeled experiences to update a goal-conditioned imitation policy. Our method, Hindsight Flow-conditioned Online Imitation (HinFlow), instantiates this idea with 2D point flows as the high-level planner. Across diverse manipulation tasks in both simulation and physical world, our method achieves more than $2\times$ performance improvement over the base policy, significantly outperforming the existing methods. Moreover, our framework enables policy acquisition from planners trained on cross-embodiment video data, demonstrating its potential for scalable and transferable robot learning.</p></details> |  |

To fully unlock the potential of IL for surgery, access to clinical datasets is needed, which unfortunately lack the kinematic data required for current IL approaches. A promising source of large-scale surgical demonstrations is monocular surgical videos available online, making monocular pose estimation a crucial step toward enabling large-scale robot learning. Toward this end, we propose SurgiPose, a differentiable rendering based approach to estimate kinematic information from monocular surgical videos, eliminating the need for direct access to ground truth kinematics. Our method infers tool trajectories and joint angles by optimizing tool pose parameters to minimize the discrepancy between rendered and real images. To evaluate the effectiveness of our approach, we conduct experiments on two robotic surgical tasks: tissue lifting and needle pickup, using the da Vinci Research Kit Si (dVRK Si). We train imitation learning policies with both ground truth measured kinematics and estimated kinematics from video and compare their performance. Our results show that policies trained on estimated kinematics achieve comparable success rates to those trained on ground truth data, demonstrating the feasibility of using monocular video based kinematic estimation for surgical robot learning. By enabling kinematic estimation from monocular surgical videos, our work lays the foundation for large scale learning of autonomous surgical policies from online surgical data.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 6 figures, 2 tables</p></details> |

While simulation has become a promising way for scaling up data collection, the related tasks, including simulation task design, task-aware scene generation, expert demonstration synthesis, and sim-to-real transfer, still demand substantial human effort. We present AnyTask, an automated framework that pairs massively parallel GPU simulation with foundation models to design diverse manipulation tasks and synthesize robot data.

This paper proposes a safety-aware approach to mitigate efficiency losses without assuming prior knowledge of safety logic. Using a deep-learning model, the robot learns the relationship between system state and safety-induced speed reductions based on execution data. Our framework does not explicitly predict human motions but directly models the interaction effects on robot speed, simplifying implementation and enhancing generalizability to different safety logics. At runtime, the learned model optimizes task selection to minimize cycle time while adhering to safety requirements. Experiments on a pick-and-packaging scenario demonstrated significant reductions in cycle times.</p></details> | 8 pages |

Yet existing methods rely on intermediate representations such as keypoints or trajectories, introducing information loss and cumulative errors that harm temporal and visual consistency. We present Mitty, a Diffusion Transformer that enables video In-Context Learning for end-to-end Human2Robot video generation. Built on a pretrained video diffusion model, Mitty leverages strong visual-temporal priors to translate human demonstrations into robot-execution videos without action labels or intermediate abstractions. Demonstration videos are compressed into condition tokens and fused with robot denoising tokens through bidirectional attention during diffusion. To mitigate paired-data scarcity, we also develop an automatic synthesis pipeline that produces high-quality human-robot pairs from large egocentric datasets.

| **[CoVAR: Co-generation of Video and Action for Robotic Manipulation via Multi-Modal Diffusion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16023v1)** | 2025-12-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present a method to generate video-action pairs that follow text instructions, starting from an initial image observation and the robot's joint states. Our approach automatically provides action labels for video diffusion models, overcoming the common lack of action annotations and enabling their full use for robotic policy learning. Existing methods either adopt two-stage pipelines, which limit tightly coupled cross-modal information sharing, or rely on adapting a single-modal diffusion model for a joint distribution that cannot fully leverage pretrained video knowledge. To overcome these limitations, we (1) extend a pretrained video diffusion model with a parallel, dedicated action diffusion model that preserves pretrained knowledge, (2) introduce a Bridge Attention mechanism to enable effective cross-modal interaction, and (3) design an action refinement module to convert coarse actions into precise controls for low-resolution datasets. Extensive evaluations on multiple public benchmarks and real-world datasets demonstrate that our method generates higher-quality videos, more accurate actions, and significantly outperforms existing baselines, offering a scalable framework for leveraging large-scale video data for robotic learning.</p></details> | 9 pages, 7 figures |

Pixels contain information at all levels, ranging from low-level attributes to high-level concepts. Autoencoders represent a classical and long-standing paradigm for learning representations from pixels or other raw inputs. In this work, we demonstrate that autoencoder-based self-supervised learning remains competitive today and can produce strong representations for downstream tasks, while remaining simple, stable, and efficient. Our model, codenamed "Pixio", is an enhanced masked autoencoder (MAE) with more challenging pre-training tasks and more capable architectures. The model is trained on 2B web-crawled images with a self-curation strategy with minimal human curation. Pixio performs competitively across a wide range of downstream tasks in the wild, including monocular depth estimation (e.g., Depth Anything), feed-forward 3D reconstruction (i.e., MapAnything), semantic segmentation, and robot learning, outperforming or matching DINOv3 trained at similar scales. Our results suggest that pixel-space self-supervised learning can serve as a promising alternative and a complement to latent-space approaches.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://github.com/facebookresearch/pixio</p></details> |

Recent works build robot foundation models by extending multimodal large language models (MLLMs) with action outputs, creating vision-language-action (VLA) systems. These efforts are motivated by the intuition that MLLMs' large-scale language and image pretraining can be effectively transferred to the action output modality. In this work, we explore an alternative paradigm of using large-scale video pretraining as a primary modality for building robot foundation models. Unlike static images and language, videos capture spatio-temporal sequences of states and actions in the physical world that are naturally aligned with robotic behavior. We curate an internet-scale video dataset of human activities and task demonstrations, and train, for the first time at a foundation-model scale, an open video model for generative robotics planning. The model produces zero-shot video plans for novel scenes and tasks, which we post-process to extract executable robot actions. We evaluate task-level generalization through third-party selected tasks in the wild and real-robot experiments, demonstrating successful physical execution. Together, these results show robust instruction following, strong generalization, and real-world feasibility. We release both the model and dataset to support open, reproducible video-based robot learning.

Despite the success of reinforcement learning (RL) in this domain, its sample inefficiency remains a significant challenge due to the intricate dynamics and partial observability of humanoid robots. To address this limitation, we propose PvP, a Proprioceptive-Privileged contrastive learning framework that leverages the intrinsic complementarity between proprioceptive and privileged states. PvP learns compact and task-relevant latent representations without requiring hand-crafted data augmentations, enabling faster and more stable policy learning. To support systematic evaluation, we develop SRL4Humanoid, the first unified and modular framework that provides high-quality implementations of representative state representation learning (SRL) methods for humanoid robot learning. Extensive experiments on the LimX Oli robot across velocity tracking and motion imitation tasks demonstrate that PvP significantly improves sample efficiency and final performance compared to baseline SRL methods. Our study further provides practical insights into integrating SRL with RL for humanoid WBC, offering valuable guidance for data-efficient humanoid robot learning.</p></details> | 13 pages, 12 figures |

However, most existing approaches rely on 2D visual inputs to perform actions in 3D physical environments, creating a significant gap between perception and action grounding. To bridge this gap, we propose a Spatial-Aware VLA Pretraining paradigm that performs explicit alignment between visual space and physical space during pretraining, enabling models to acquire 3D spatial understanding before robot policy learning. Starting from pretrained vision-language models, we leverage large-scale human demonstration videos to extract 3D visual and 3D action annotations, forming a new source of supervision that aligns 2D visual observations with 3D spatial reasoning. We instantiate this paradigm with VIPA-VLA, a dual-encoder architecture that incorporates a 3D visual encoder to augment semantic visual representations with 3D-aware features. When adapted to downstream robot tasks, VIPA-VLA achieves significantly improved grounding between 2D vision and 3D action, resulting in more robust and generalizable robotic policies.</p></details> |  |

However, most existing systems only offer unilateral robot control and lack the ability to synchronize the robot's status with the teleoperation hardware, preventing real-time, flexible intervention. In this work, we introduce HACTS (Human-As-Copilot Teleoperation System), a novel system that establishes bilateral, real-time joint synchronization between a robot arm and teleoperation hardware. This simple yet effective feedback mechanism, akin to a steering wheel in autonomous vehicles, enables the human copilot to intervene seamlessly while collecting action-correction data for future learning. Implemented using 3D-printed components and low-cost, off-the-shelf motors, HACTS is both accessible and scalable. Our experiments show that HACTS significantly enhances performance in imitation learning (IL) and reinforcement learning (RL) tasks, boosting IL recovery capabilities and data efficiency, and facilitating human-in-the-loop RL. HACTS paves the way for more effective and interactive human-robot collaboration and data-collection, advancing the capabilities of robot manipulation.</p></details> |  |

However, inferring 4D interactions from a single RGB view is highly challenging due to the unknown object and human information, depth ambiguity, occlusion, and complex motion, which hinder consistent 3D and temporal reconstruction. Previous methods simplify the setup by assuming ground truth object template or constraining to a limited set of object categories. We present CARI4D, the first category-agnostic method that reconstructs spatially and temporarily consistent 4D human-object interaction at metric scale from monocular RGB videos. To this end, we propose a pose hypothesis selection algorithm that robustly integrates the individual predictions from foundation models, jointly refine them through a learned render-and-compare paradigm to ensure spatial, temporal and pixel alignment, and finally reasoning about intricate contacts for further refinement satisfying physical constraints. Experiments show that our method outperforms prior art by 38% on in-distribution dataset and 36% on unseen dataset in terms of reconstruction error. Our model generalizes beyond the training categories and thus can be applied zero-shot to in-the-wild internet videos.

Compared to the wide application of binary human feedback, scalar human feedback has been used less because it is believed to be noisy and unstable. In this paper, we compare scalar and binary feedback, and demonstrate that scalar feedback benefits learning when properly handled. We collected binary or scalar feedback respectively from two groups of crowdworkers on a robot task. We found that when considering how consistently a participant labeled the same data, scalar feedback led to less consistency than binary feedback; however, the difference vanishes if small mismatches are allowed. Additionally, scalar and binary feedback show no significant differences in their correlations with key Reinforcement Learning targets. We then introduce Stabilizing TEacher Assessment DYnamics (STEADY) to improve learning from scalar feedback. Based on the idea that scalar feedback is muti-distributional, STEADY re-constructs underlying positive and negative feedback distributions and re-scales scalar feedback based on feedback statistics. We show that models trained with \textit{scalar feedback + STEADY } outperform baselines, including binary feedback and raw scalar feedback, in a robot reaching task with non-expert human feedback. Our results show that both binary feedback and scalar feedback are dynamic, and scalar feedback is a promising signal for use in interactive Reinforcement Learning.</p></details> |  |

We propose a video-to-video translation framework that converts ordinary human-object interaction videos into motion-consistent robot manipulation videos with realistic, physically grounded interactions. Our approach does not require any paired human-robot videos for training only a set of unpaired robot videos, making the system easy to scale. We introduce a transferable representation that bridges the embodiment gap: by inpainting the robot arm in training videos to obtain a clean background and overlaying a simple visual cue (a marker and arrow indicating the gripper's position and orientation), we can condition a generative model to insert the robot arm back into the scene. At test time, we apply the same process to human videos (inpainting the person and overlaying human pose cues) and generate high-quality robot videos that mimic the human's actions. We fine-tune a SOTA video diffusion model (Wan 2.2) in an in-context learning manner to ensure temporal coherence and leveraging of its rich prior knowledge. Empirical results demonstrate that our approach achieves significantly more realistic and grounded robot motions compared to baselines, pointing to a promising direction for scaling up robot learning from unlabeled human videos.

While recent advances in deep reinforcement learning (DRL) have enabled end-to-end flight control, the field still lacks systematic design guidelines and a unified infrastructure to support reproducible training and real-world deployment. We present a task-oriented framework for end-to-end DRL in quadrotors that integrates design principles for complex task specification and reveals the interdependencies among simulated task definition, training design principles, and physical deployment. Our framework involves software infrastructure, hardware platforms, and open-source firmware to support a full-stack learning infrastructure and workflow. Extensive empirical results demonstrate robust flight and sim-to-real generalization under real-world disturbances. By reducing the entry barrier for deploying learning-based controllers on aerial robots, our work lays a practical foundation for advancing autonomous flight in dynamic and unstructured environments.</p></details> |  |

Many such tasks inherently demand multimodal reasoning; for example, filling a bottle with water will lead to visual information alone being ambiguous or incomplete, thereby requiring reasoning over the temporal evolution of audio, accounting for its underlying physical properties and pitch patterns. In this paper, we propose a generative latent flow matching model to anticipate future audio observations, enabling the system to reason about long-term consequences when integrated into a robot policy. We demonstrate the superior capabilities of our system through two manipulation tasks that require perceiving in-the-wild audio or music signals, compared to methods without future lookahead. We further emphasize that successful robot action learning for these tasks relies not merely on multi-modal input, but critically on the accurate prediction of future audio states that embody intrinsic rhythmic patterns.</p></details> |  |

In this work, inspired by the denoising capability of diffusion models, we invert the conventional perspective and propose a clean-to-noisy paradigm that learns to synthesize noisy depth, thereby bridging the visual sim2real gap through purely simulation-driven robotic learning. Building on this idea, we introduce RealD$^2$iff, a hierarchical coarse-to-fine diffusion framework that decomposes depth noise into global structural distortions and fine-grained local perturbations. To enable progressive learning of these components, we further develop two complementary strategies: Frequency-Guided Supervision (FGS) for global structure modeling and Discrepancy-Guided Optimization (DGO) for localized refinement. To integrate RealD$^2$iff seamlessly into imitation learning, we construct a pipeline that spans six stages. We provide comprehensive empirical and experimental validation demonstrating the effectiveness of this paradigm. RealD$^2$iff enables two key applications: (1) generating real-world-like depth to construct clean-noisy paired datasets without manual sensor data collection. (2) Achieving zero-shot sim2real robot manipulation, substantially improving real-world performance without additional fine-tuning.</p></details> | <details><summary>We ar...</summary><p>We are the author team of the paper "RealD$^2$iff: Bridging Real-World Gap in Robot Manipulation via Depth Diffusion".

However, their core process of action tokenization often involves a trade-off between reconstruction fidelity and inference efficiency. We introduce FASTer, a unified framework for efficient and generalizable robot learning that integrates a learnable tokenizer with an autoregressive policy built upon it. FASTerVQ encodes action chunks as single-channel images, capturing global spatio-temporal dependencies while maintaining a high compression ratio. FASTerVLA builds on this tokenizer with block-wise autoregressive decoding and a lightweight action expert, achieving both faster inference and higher task performance. Extensive experiments across simulated and real-world benchmarks show that FASTerVQ delivers superior reconstruction quality, high token utilization, and strong cross-task and cross-embodiment generalization, while FASTerVLA further improves overall capability, surpassing previous state-of-the-art VLA models in both inference speed and task performance.</p></details> |  |

While recent Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models leverage large pre-trained understanding models for perception and instruction following, their ability to generalize to novel tasks, objects, and settings remains limited. In this work, we present VideoVLA, a simple approach that explores the potential of transforming large video generation models into robotic VLA manipulators. Given a language instruction and an image, VideoVLA predicts an action sequence as well as the future visual outcomes. Built on a multi-modal Diffusion Transformer, VideoVLA jointly models video, language, and action modalities, using pre-trained video generative models for joint visual and action forecasting. Our experiments show that high-quality imagined futures correlate with reliable action predictions and task success, highlighting the importance of visual imagination in manipulation. VideoVLA demonstrates strong generalization, including imitating other embodiments' skills and handling novel objects.

For humanoid robots, human videos and motion data are abundant and widely available, offering a free and large-scale data source. Besides, the semantics related to the motions enable modality alignment and high-level robot control learning. However, how to effectively mine raw video, extract robot-learnable representations, and leverage them for scalable learning remains an open problem. To address this, we introduce Humanoid-Union, a large-scale dataset generated through an autonomous pipeline, comprising over 260 hours of diverse, high-quality humanoid robot motion data with semantic annotations derived from human motion videos. The dataset can be further expanded via the same pipeline. Building on this data resource, we propose SCHUR, a scalable learning framework designed to explore the impact of large-scale data on high-level control in humanoid robots. Experimental results demonstrate that SCHUR achieves high robot motion generation quality and strong text-motion alignment under data and model scaling, with 37\% reconstruction improvement under MPJPE and 25\% alignment improvement under FID comparing with previous methods. Its effectiveness is further validated through deployment in real-world humanoid robot.</p></details> |  |

Traditional rule-based methods often struggle to achieve accurate ball control due to their reliance on fixed walking patterns and limited adaptability to real-time ball dynamics. To address these challenges, we propose a two-stage curriculum learning framework that enables a humanoid robot to acquire dribbling skills without explicit dynamics or predefined trajectories. In the first stage, the robot learns basic locomotion skills; in the second stage, we fine-tune the policy for agile dribbling maneuvers. We further introduce a virtual camera model in simulation that simulates the field of view and perception constraints of the real robot, enabling realistic ball perception during training. We also design heuristic rewards to encourage active sensing, promoting a broader visual range for continuous ball perception. The policy is trained in simulation and successfully transferred to a physical humanoid robot. Experiment results demonstrate that our method enables effective ball manipulation, achieving flexible and visually appealing dribbling behaviors across multiple environments. This work highlights the potential of reinforcement learning in developing agile humanoid soccer robots.

| **[World Models That Know When They Don't Know: Controllable Video Generation with Calibrated Uncertainty](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05927v1)** | 2025-12-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in generative video models have led to significant breakthroughs in high-fidelity video synthesis, specifically in controllable video generation where the generated video is conditioned on text and action inputs, e.g., in instruction-guided video editing and world modeling in robotics. Despite these exceptional capabilities, controllable video models often hallucinate - generating future video frames that are misaligned with physical reality - which raises serious concerns in many tasks such as robot policy evaluation and planning. However, state-of-the-art video models lack the ability to assess and express their confidence, impeding hallucination mitigation. To rigorously address this challenge, we propose C3, an uncertainty quantification (UQ) method for training continuous-scale calibrated controllable video models for dense confidence estimation at the subpatch level, precisely localizing the uncertainty in each generated video frame. Our UQ method introduces three core innovations to empower video models to estimate their uncertainty. First, our method develops a novel framework that trains video models for correctness and calibration via strictly proper scoring rules. Second, we estimate the video model's uncertainty in latent space, avoiding training instability and prohibitive training costs associated with pixel-space approaches. Third, we map the dense latent-space uncertainty to interpretable pixel-level uncertainty in the RGB space for intuitive visualization, providing high-resolution uncertainty heatmaps that identify untrustworthy regions. Through extensive experiments on large-scale robot learning datasets (Bridge and DROID) and real-world evaluations, we demonstrate that our method not only provides calibrated uncertainty estimates within the training distribution, but also enables effective out-of-distribution detection.</p></details> |  |

We attribute this gap to two factors: the lack of state-action-state dynamics modeling and the unnecessary redundancy of explicit geometric reconstruction. We introduce AFRO, a self-supervised framework that learns dynamics-aware 3D representations without action or reconstruction supervision. AFRO casts state prediction as a generative diffusion process and jointly models forward and inverse dynamics in a shared latent space to capture causal transition structure. To prevent feature leakage in action learning, we employ feature differencing and inverse-consistency supervision, improving the quality and stability of visual features. When combined with Diffusion Policy, AFRO substantially increases manipulation success rates across 16 simulated and 4 real-world tasks, outperforming existing pre-training approaches. The framework also scales favorably with data volume and task complexity. Qualitative visualizations indicate that AFRO learns semantically rich, discriminative features, offering an effective pre-training solution for 3D representation learning in robotics.

However, generative models within this field face a fundamental trade-off between the slow, iterative sampling of diffusion models and the architectural constraints of faster Flow-based methods, which often rely on explicit consistency losses. To address these limitations, we introduce MP1, which pairs 3D point-cloud inputs with the MeanFlow paradigm to generate action trajectories in one network function evaluation (1-NFE). By directly learning the interval-averaged velocity via the "MeanFlow Identity", our policy avoids any additional consistency constraints. This formulation eliminates numerical ODE-solver errors during inference, yielding more precise trajectories. MP1 further incorporates CFG for improved trajectory controllability while retaining 1-NFE inference without reintroducing structural constraints. Because subtle scene-context variations are critical for robot learning, especially in few-shot learning, we introduce a lightweight Dispersive Loss that repels state embeddings during training, boosting generalization without slowing inference. We validate our method on the Adroit and Meta-World benchmarks, as well as in real-world scenarios. Experimental results show MP1 achieves superior average task success rates, outperforming DP3 by 10.2% and FlowPolicy by 7.3%. Its average inference time is only 6.8 ms-19x faster than DP3 and nearly 2x faster than FlowPolicy.

We argue this provides an insufficient representation and propose the Vision Action Transformer (VAT), a novel architecture that is extended from ViT and unlocks the full feature hierarchy of ViT. VAT processes specialized action tokens with visual features across all transformer layers, enabling a deep and progressive fusion of perception and action generation. On a suite of simulated manipulation tasks, VAT achieves a 98.15\% average success rate across four LIBERO benchmarks, establishing a new state-of-the-art by outperforming prior methods like OpenVLA-OFT.

From monocular RGB or RGB-D inputs, we perform high precision HOI reconstruction and enforce physical plausibility via a reinforcement learning (RL) optimizer that refines hand object relative poses under contact and penetration constraints. The reconstructed, contact rich trajectories are then retargeted to cross-embodiments, robot arms with simple end effectors, dexterous hands, and humanoids, yielding executable actions and rollouts. To scale coverage, we build a simulation-augmented framework on Isaac Sim with diverse domain randomization (embodiments, trajectories, object retrieval, background textures, hand motion mirroring), which enriches the distributions of trajectories and observations while preserving spatial relationships and physical plausibility. The entire data pipeline forms an end to end pipeline from video,reconstruction,retargeting,augmentation data acquisition. We validate the data on mainstream vision language action (VLA) and imitation learning architectures, demonstrating that trajectories produced by our pipeline are as stable as those from teleoperation and yield comparable continual performance gains. To our knowledge, this provides the first quantitative evidence that HOI modalities can serve as effective supervision for robotic learning. Compared with teleoperation, Robowheel is lightweight, a single monocular RGB(D) camera is sufficient to extract a universal, embodiment agnostic motion representation that could be flexibly retargeted across embodiments. We further assemble a large scale multimodal dataset combining multi-camera captures, monocular videos, and public HOI corpora for training and evaluating embodied models.</p></details> | 27 Pages, 21 figures |

However, on-robot data collection is labor-intensive and often limited to specific environments. In contrast, open-world images capture a vast diversity of real-world scenes that naturally align with robotic manipulation tasks, offering a promising avenue for low-cost, large-scale robot data acquisition. Despite this potential, the lack of associated robot actions hinders the practical use of open-world images for robot learning, leaving this rich visual resource largely unexploited. To bridge this gap, we propose IGen, a framework that scalably generates realistic visual observations and executable actions from open-world images. IGen first converts unstructured 2D pixels into structured 3D scene representations suitable for scene understanding and manipulation. It then leverages the reasoning capabilities of vision-language models to transform scene-specific task instructions into high-level plans and generate low-level actions as SE(3) end-effector pose sequences. From these poses, it synthesizes dynamic scene evolution and renders temporally coherent visual observations. Experiments validate the high quality of visuomotor data generated by IGen, and show that policies trained solely on IGen-synthesized data achieve performance comparable to those trained on real-world data. This highlights the potential of IGen to support scalable data generation from open-world images for generalist robotic policy training.</p></details> | 8 pages, 8 figures |

Under such partial observability, optimal behavior typically involves explicitly acting to gain the missing information. Today's standard robot learning techniques struggle to produce such active perception behaviors. We propose a simple real-world robot learning recipe to efficiently train active perception policies. Our approach, asymmetric advantage weighted regression (AAWR), exploits access to "privileged" extra sensors at training time. The privileged sensors enable training high-quality privileged value functions that aid in estimating the advantage of the target policy. Bootstrapping from a small number of potentially suboptimal demonstrations and an easy-to-obtain coarse policy initialization, AAWR quickly acquires active perception behaviors and boosts task performance. In evaluations on 8 manipulation tasks on 3 robots spanning varying degrees of partial observability, AAWR synthesizes reliable active perception behaviors that outperform all prior approaches. When initialized with a "generalist" robot policy that struggles with active perception tasks, AAWR efficiently generates information-gathering behaviors that allow it to operate under severe partial observability for manipulation tasks.

Building on these advances, we develop a teacher-student-bootstrap learning framework for vision-based humanoid loco-manipulation, using articulated-object interaction as a representative high-difficulty benchmark. Our approach introduces a staged-reset exploration strategy that stabilizes long-horizon privileged-policy training, and a GRPO-based fine-tuning procedure that mitigates partial observability and improves closed-loop consistency in sim-to-real RL. Trained entirely on simulation data, the resulting policy achieves robust zero-shot performance across diverse door types and outperforms human teleoperators by up to 31.7% in task completion time under the same whole-body control stack. This represents the first humanoid sim-to-real policy capable of diverse articulated loco-manipulation using pure RGB perception.</p></details> | <details><summary>https...</summary><p>https://doorman-humanoid.github.io/</p></details> |

Though recent results show that learning from demonstration, also known as imitation learning (IL), can suffer errors that compound exponentially with task horizon in continuous settings, we demonstrate that action chunking and exploratory data collection circumvent exponential compounding errors in different regimes. Our results identify control-theoretic stability as the key mechanism underlying the benefits of these interventions. On the empirical side, we validate our predictions and the role of control-theoretic stability through experimentation on popular robot learning benchmarks. On the theoretical side, we demonstrate that the control-theoretic lens provides fine-grained insights into how compounding error arises, leading to tighter statistical guarantees on imitation learning error when these interventions are applied than previous techniques based on information-theoretic considerations alone.</p></details> | <details><summary>Updat...</summary><p>Updated manuscript.

Learning to manipulate granular materials based on physical information obtained through precise modelling remains an unsolved problem. In this paper, we propose to address this challenge by constructing a differentiable physics-based simulator for granular materials using the Taichi programming language and developing a learning framework accelerated by demonstrations generated through gradient-based optimisation on non-granular materials within our simulator, eliminating the costly data collection and model training of prior methods. Experimental results show that our method, with its flexible design, trains robust policies that are capable of executing the task of transporting granular materials in both simulated and real-world environments, beyond the capabilities of standard reinforcement learning, imitation learning, and prior task-specific granular manipulation methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted as a regular paper by IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks and Learning Systems (TNNLS)</p></details> |
| **[Learning Primitive Embodied World Models: Towards Scalable Robotic Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20840v3)** | 2025-11-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While video-generation-based embodied world models have gained increasing attention, their reliance on large-scale embodied interaction data remains a key bottleneck. The scarcity, difficulty of collection, and high dimensionality of embodied data fundamentally limit the alignment granularity between language and actions and exacerbate the challenge of long-horizon video generation--hindering generative models from achieving a "GPT moment" in the embodied domain. There is a naive observation: the diversity of embodied data far exceeds the relatively small space of possible primitive motions. Based on this insight, we propose a novel paradigm for world modeling--Primitive Embodied World Models (PEWM). By restricting video generation to fixed short horizons, our approach 1) enables fine-grained alignment between linguistic concepts and visual representations of robotic actions, 2) reduces learning complexity, 3) improves data efficiency in embodied data collection, and 4) decreases inference latency. By equipping with a modular Vision-Language Model (VLM) planner and a Start-Goal heatmap Guidance mechanism (SGG), PEWM further enables flexible closed-loop control and supports compositional generalization of primitive-level policies over extended, complex tasks. Our framework leverages the spatiotemporal vision priors in video models and the semantic awareness of VLMs to bridge the gap between fine-grained physical interaction and high-level reasoning, paving the way toward scalable, interpretable, and general-purpose embodied intelligence.</p></details> |  |
| **[Mask2IV: Interaction-Centric Video Generation via Mask Trajectories](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03135v2)** | 2025-11-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generating interaction-centric videos, such as those depicting humans or robots interacting with objects, is crucial for embodied intelligence, as they provide rich and diverse visual priors for robot learning, manipulation policy training, and affordance reasoning. However, existing methods often struggle to model such complex and dynamic interactions. While recent studies show that masks can serve as effective control signals and enhance generation quality, obtaining dense and precise mask annotations remains a major challenge for real-world use. To overcome this limitation, we introduce Mask2IV, a novel framework specifically designed for interaction-centric video generation. It adopts a decoupled two-stage pipeline that first predicts plausible motion trajectories for both actor and object, then generates a video conditioned on these trajectories. This design eliminates the need for dense mask inputs from users while preserving the flexibility to manipulate the interaction process. Furthermore, Mask2IV supports versatile and intuitive control, allowing users to specify the target object of interaction and guide the motion trajectory through action descriptions or spatial position cues. To support systematic training and evaluation, we curate two benchmarks covering diverse action and object categories across both human-object interaction and robotic manipulation scenarios. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves superior visual realism and controllability compared to existing baselines.</p></details> | <details><summary>AAAI ...</summary><p>AAAI 2026.

| **[Green Resilience of Cyber-Physical Systems: Doctoral Dissertation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16593v1)** | 2025-11-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Cyber-physical systems (CPS) combine computational and physical components. Online Collaborative AI System (OL-CAIS) is a type of CPS that learn online in collaboration with humans to achieve a common goal, which makes it vulnerable to disruptive events that degrade performance. Decision-makers must therefore restore performance while limiting energy impact, creating a trade-off between resilience and greenness. This research addresses how to balance these two properties in OL-CAIS. It aims to model resilience for automatic state detection, develop agent-based policies that optimize the greenness-resilience trade-off, and understand catastrophic forgetting to maintain performance consistency. We model OL-CAIS behavior through three operational states: steady, disruptive, and final. To support recovery during disruptions, we introduce the GResilience framework, which provides recovery strategies through multi-objective optimization (one-agent), game-theoretic decision-making (two-agent), and reinforcement learning (RL-agent). We also design a measurement framework to quantify resilience and greenness. Empirical evaluation uses real and simulated experiments with a collaborative robot learning object classification from human demonstrations. Results show that the resilience model captures performance transitions during disruptions, and that GResilience policies improve green recovery by shortening recovery time, stabilizing performance, and reducing human dependency. RL-agent policies achieve the strongest results, although with a marginal increase in CO2 emissions. We also observe catastrophic forgetting after repeated disruptions, while our policies help maintain steadiness. A comparison with containerized execution shows that containerization cuts CO2 emissions by half. Overall, this research provides models, metrics, and policies that ensure the green recovery of OL-CAIS.</p></details> |  |
| **[DynaMimicGen: A Data Generation Framework for Robot Learning of Dynamic Tasks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16223v1)** | 2025-11-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Learning robust manipulation policies typically requires large and diverse datasets, the collection of which is time-consuming, labor-intensive, and often impractical for dynamic environments. In this work, we introduce DynaMimicGen (D-MG), a scalable dataset generation framework that enables policy training from minimal human supervision while uniquely supporting dynamic task settings. Given only a few human demonstrations, D-MG first segments the demonstrations into meaningful sub-tasks, then leverages Dynamic Movement Primitives (DMPs) to adapt and generalize the demonstrated behaviors to novel and dynamically changing environments. Improving prior methods that rely on static assumptions or simplistic trajectory interpolation, D-MG produces smooth, realistic, and task-consistent Cartesian trajectories that adapt in real time to changes in object poses, robot states, or scene geometry during task execution. Our method supports different scenarios - including scene layouts, object instances, and robot configurations - making it suitable for both static and highly dynamic manipulation tasks. We show that robot agents trained via imitation learning on D-MG-generated data achieve strong performance across long-horizon and contact-rich benchmarks, including tasks like cube stacking and placing mugs in drawers, even under unpredictable environment changes. By eliminating the need for extensive human demonstrations and enabling generalization in dynamic settings, D-MG offers a powerful and efficient alternative to manual data collection, paving the way toward scalable, autonomous robot learning.</p></details> |  |

We present RL-100, a real-world reinforcement learning framework built on diffusion-based visuomotor policies. RL-100 unifies imitation and reinforcement learning under a single PPO-style objective applied within the denoising process, yielding conservative and stable policy improvements across both offline and online stages. To meet deployment latency constraints, we employ a lightweight consistency distillation procedure that compresses multi-step diffusion into a one-step controller for high-frequency control. The framework is task-, embodiment-, and representation-agnostic, and supports both single-action outputs and action-chunking control. We evaluate RL-100 on seven diverse real-robot manipulation tasks, ranging from dynamic pushing and agile bowling to pouring, cloth folding, unscrewing, and multi-stage juicing. RL-100 attains 100% success across evaluated trials, achieving 900 out of 900 successful episodes, including up to 250 out of 250 consecutive trials on one task, and matches or surpasses expert teleoperators in time-to-completion. Without retraining, a single policy attains approximately 90% zero-shot success under environmental and dynamics shifts, adapts in a few-shot regime to significant task variations (86.7%), and remains robust to aggressive human perturbations (about 95%). In a public shopping-mall deployment, the juicing robot served random customers continuously for roughly seven hours without failure. Together, these results suggest a practical path toward deployment-ready robot learning: start from human priors, align training objectives with human-grounded metrics, and reliably extend performance beyond human demonstrations.</p></details> | <details><summary>https...</summary><p>https://lei-kun.github.io/RL-100/</p></details> |

Various branches of LfD research (e.g., learned dynamical systems and movement primitives) can generally be classified into ''time-dependent'' or ''time-independent'' systems. Each provides fundamental benefits and drawbacks -- time-independent methods cannot learn overlapping trajectories, while time-dependence can result in undesirable behavior under perturbation. This paper introduces Cluster Alignment for Learned Motions (CALM), an LfD framework dependent upon an alignment with a representative ''mean" trajectory of demonstrated motions rather than pure time- or state-dependence. We discuss the convergence properties of CALM, introduce an alignment technique able to handle the shifts in alignment possible under perturbation, and utilize demonstration clustering to generate multi-modal behavior. We show how CALM mitigates the drawbacks of time-dependent and time-independent techniques on 2D datasets and implement our system on a 7-DoF robot learning tasks in three domains.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 8 figures, originally published in the IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters</p></details> |

However, most existing 3D assets in simulation are rigid, and manually converting them into articulated objects is extremely labor- and cost-intensive. This raises a natural question: can we automatically identify articulable objects in a scene and convert them into articulated assets directly? In this paper, we present ArtiWorld, a scene-aware pipeline that localizes candidate articulable objects from textual scene descriptions and reconstructs executable URDF models that preserve the original geometry. At the core of this pipeline is Arti4URDF, which leverages 3D point cloud, prior knowledge of a large language model (LLM), and a URDF-oriented prompt design to rapidly convert rigid objects into interactive URDF-based articulated objects while maintaining their 3D shape. We evaluate ArtiWorld at three levels: 3D simulated objects, full 3D simulated scenes, and real-world scan scenes. Across all three settings, our method consistently outperforms existing approaches and achieves state-of-the-art performance, while preserving object geometry and correctly capturing object interactivity to produce usable URDF-based articulated models. This provides a practical path toward building interactive, robot-ready simulation environments directly from existing 3D assets. Code and data will be released.</p></details> |  |

Caregiving tasks involve complex physical human-robot interactions, requiring precise perception under occlusions, safe physical contact, and long-horizon planning. While recent advances in robot learning from demonstrations have shown promise, there is a lack of a large-scale, diverse, and expert-driven dataset that captures real-world caregiving routines. To address this gap, we collect data from 21 occupational therapists performing 15 ADL tasks on two manikins. The dataset spans five modalities: RGB-D video, pose tracking, eye-gaze tracking, task and action annotations, and tactile sensing, providing rich multimodal insights into caregiver movement, attention, force application, and task execution strategies. We further analyze expert caregiving principles and strategies, offering insights to improve robot efficiency and task feasibility. Additionally, our evaluations demonstrate that OpenRoboCare presents challenges for state-of-the-art robot perception and human activity recognition methods, both critical for developing safe and adaptive assistive robots, highlighting the value of our contribution.

The Universal Manipulation Interface (UMI) relaxes the strict hardware requirements for data collection, but it is restricted to capturing only RGB images of a scene and omits the 3D geometric information on which many tasks rely. Inspired by DemoGen, we propose UMIGen, a unified framework that consists of two key components: (1) Cloud-UMI, a handheld data collection device that requires no visual SLAM and simultaneously records point cloud observation-action pairs; and (2) a visibility-aware optimization mechanism that extends the DemoGen pipeline to egocentric 3D observations by generating only points within the camera's field of view. These two components enable efficient data generation that aligns with real egocentric observations and can be directly transferred across different robot embodiments without any post-processing. Experiments in both simulated and real-world settings demonstrate that UMIGen supports strong cross-embodiment generalization and accelerates data collection in diverse manipulation tasks.</p></details> |  |

Videos, including those of humans or teleoperated robots, capture rich physical interactions. However, most of them lack labeled actions, which limits their use in robot learning. We present Video Prediction for Robot Actions (ViPRA), a simple pretraining-finetuning framework that learns continuous robot control from these actionless videos. Instead of directly predicting actions, we train a video-language model to predict both future visual observations and motion-centric latent actions, which serve as intermediate representations of scene dynamics. We train these latent actions using perceptual losses and optical flow consistency to ensure they reflect physically grounded behavior. For downstream control, we introduce a chunked flow matching decoder that maps latent actions to robot-specific continuous action sequences, using only 100 to 200 teleoperated demonstrations. This approach avoids expensive action annotation, supports generalization across embodiments, and enables smooth, high-frequency continuous control upto 22 Hz via chunked action decoding. Unlike prior latent action works that treat pretraining as autoregressive policy learning, explicitly models both what changes and how. Our method outperforms strong baselines, with a 16% gain on the SIMPLER benchmark and a 13% improvement across real world manipulation tasks.

| **[A QP Framework for Improving Data Collection: Quantifying Device-Controller Performance in Robot Teleoperation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07720v1)** | 2025-11-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Robot learning empowers the robot system with human brain-like intelligence to autonomously acquire and adapt skills through experience, enhancing flexibility and adaptability in various environments. Aimed at achieving a similar level of capability in large language models (LLMs) for embodied intelligence, data quality plays a crucial role in training a foundational model with diverse robot skills. In this study, we investigate the collection of data for manipulation tasks using teleoperation devices. Different devices yield varying effects when paired with corresponding controller strategies, including position-based inverse kinematics (IK) control, torque-based inverse dynamics (ID) control, and optimization-based compliance control. In this paper, we develop a teleoperation pipeline that is compatible with different teleoperation devices and manipulator controllers. Within the pipeline, we construct the optimal QP formulation with the dynamic nullspace and the impedance tracking as the novel optimal controller to achieve compliant pose tracking and singularity avoidance. Regarding the optimal controller, it adaptively adjusts the weights assignment depending on the robot joint manipulability that reflects the state of joint configuration for the pose tracking in the form of impedance control and singularity avoidance with nullspace tracking. Analysis of quantitative experimental results suggests the quality of the teleoperated trajectory data, including tracking error, occurrence of singularity, and the smoothness of the joints' trajectory, with different combinations of teleoperation interface and the motion controller.</p></details> |  |
| **[Time-Aware Policy Learning for Adaptive and Punctual Robot Control](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07654v1)** | 2025-11-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Temporal awareness underlies intelligent behavior in both animals and humans, guiding how actions are sequenced, paced, and adapted to changing goals and environments. Yet most robot learning algorithms remain blind to time. We introduce time-aware policy learning, a reinforcement learning framework that enables robots to explicitly perceive and reason with time as a first-class variable. The framework augments conventional reinforcement policies with two complementary temporal signals, the remaining time and a time ratio, which allow a single policy to modulate its behavior continuously from rapid and dynamic to cautious and precise execution. By jointly optimizing punctuality and stability, the robot learns to balance efficiency, robustness, resiliency, and punctuality without re-training or reward adjustment. Across diverse manipulation domains from long-horizon pick and place, to granular-media pouring, articulated-object handling, and multi-agent object delivery, the time-aware policy produces adaptive behaviors that outperform standard reinforcement learning baselines by up to 48% in efficiency, 8 times more robust in sim-to-real transfer, and 90% in acoustic quietness while maintaining near-perfect success rates. Explicit temporal reasoning further enables real-time human-in-the-loop control and multi-agent coordination, allowing robots to recover from disturbances, re-synchronize after delays, and align motion tempo with human intent. By treating time not as a constraint but as a controllable dimension of behavior, time-aware policy learning provides a unified foundation for efficient, robust, resilient, and human-aligned robot autonomy.</p></details> |  |

However, established MARL platforms (e.g., SMAC and MPE) lack robotics relevance and hardware deployment, leaving multi-robot learning researchers to develop bespoke environments and hardware testbeds dedicated to the development and evaluation of their individual contributions. The Multi-Agent RL Benchmark and Learning Environment for the Robotarium (MARBLER) is an exciting recent step in providing a standardized robotics-relevant platform for MARL, by bridging the Robotarium testbed with existing MARL software infrastructure. However, MARBLER lacks support for parallelization and GPU/TPU execution, making the platform prohibitively slow compared to modern MARL environments and hindering adoption. We contribute JaxRobotarium, a Jax-powered end-to-end simulation, learning, deployment, and benchmarking platform for the Robotarium. JaxRobotarium enables rapid training and deployment of multi-robot RL (MRRL) policies with realistic robot dynamics and safety constraints, supporting parallelization and hardware acceleration. Our generalizable learning interface integrates easily with SOTA MARL libraries (e.g., JaxMARL). In addition, JaxRobotarium includes eight standardized coordination scenarios, including four novel scenarios that bring established MARL benchmark tasks (e.g., RWARE and Level-Based Foraging) to a robotics setting. We demonstrate that JaxRobotarium retains high simulation fidelity while achieving dramatic speedups over baseline (20x in training and 150x in simulation), and provides an open-access sim-to-real evaluation pipeline through the Robotarium testbed, accelerating and democratizing access to multi-robot learning research and evaluation.

Recent video generation models can synthesize photorealistic visual demonstrations from language commands and images, offering a powerful yet underexplored source of training signals for robotics. However, directly retargeting pixel motions from generated videos to robots neglects physics, often resulting in inaccurate manipulations. PhysWorld addresses this limitation by coupling video generation with physical world reconstruction. Given a single image and a task command, our method generates task-conditioned videos and reconstructs the underlying physical world from the videos, and the generated video motions are grounded into physically accurate actions through object-centric residual reinforcement learning with the physical world model. This synergy transforms implicit visual guidance into physically executable robotic trajectories, eliminating the need for real robot data collection and enabling zero-shot generalizable robotic manipulation.

| **[Rapidly Learning Soft Robot Control via Implicit Time-Stepping](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06667v1)** | 2025-11-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the explosive growth of rigid-body simulators, policy learning in simulation has become the de facto standard for most rigid morphologies. In contrast, soft robotic simulation frameworks remain scarce and are seldom adopted by the soft robotics community. This gap stems partly from the lack of easy-to-use, general-purpose frameworks and partly from the high computational cost of accurately simulating continuum mechanics, which often renders policy learning infeasible. In this work, we demonstrate that rapid soft robot policy learning is indeed achievable via implicit time-stepping. Our simulator of choice, DisMech, is a general-purpose, fully implicit soft-body simulator capable of handling both soft dynamics and frictional contact. We further introduce delta natural curvature control, a method analogous to delta joint position control in rigid manipulators, providing an intuitive and effective means of enacting control for soft robot learning. To highlight the benefits of implicit time-stepping and delta curvature control, we conduct extensive comparisons across four diverse soft manipulator tasks against one of the most widely used soft-body frameworks, Elastica. With implicit time-stepping, parallel stepping of 500 environments achieves up to 6x faster speeds for non-contact cases and up to 40x faster for contact-rich scenarios. Finally, a comprehensive sim-to-sim gap evaluation--training policies in one simulator and evaluating them in another--demonstrates that implicit time-stepping provides a rare free lunch: dramatic speedups achieved without sacrificing accuracy.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code:...</summary><p>Code: https://github.com/QuantuMope/dismech-rl</p></details> |

However, a key hurdle in achieving this goal lies in the robots' ability to manipulate objects in their unstructured surrounding environments according to different tasks. The learning-based approach is considered an effective way to address generalization. The impressive performance of foundation models in the fields of computer vision and natural language suggests the potential of embedding foundation models into manipulation tasks as a viable path toward achieving general manipulation capability. However, we believe achieving general manipulation capability requires an overarching framework akin to auto driving. This framework should encompass multiple functional modules, with different foundation models assuming distinct roles in facilitating general manipulation capability. This survey focuses on the contributions of foundation models to robot learning for manipulation. We propose a comprehensive framework and detail how foundation models can address challenges in each module of the framework. What's more, we examine current approaches, outline challenges, suggest future research directions, and identify potential risks associated with integrating foundation models into this domain.</p></details> |  |

| **[ReGen: Generative Robot Simulation via Inverse Design](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04769v1)** | 2025-11-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Simulation plays a key role in scaling robot learning and validating policies, but constructing simulations remains a labor-intensive process. This paper introduces ReGen, a generative simulation framework that automates simulation design via inverse design. Given a robot's behavior -- such as a motion trajectory or an objective function -- and its textual description, ReGen infers plausible scenarios and environments that could have caused the behavior. ReGen leverages large language models to synthesize scenarios by expanding a directed graph that encodes cause-and-effect relationships, relevant entities, and their properties. This structured graph is then translated into a symbolic program, which configures and executes a robot simulation environment. Our framework supports (i) augmenting simulations based on ego-agent behaviors, (ii) controllable, counterfactual scenario generation, (iii) reasoning about agent cognition and mental states, and (iv) reasoning with distinct sensing modalities, such as braking due to faulty GPS signals. We demonstrate ReGen in autonomous driving and robot manipulation tasks, generating more diverse, complex simulated environments compared to existing simulations with high success rates, and enabling controllable generation for corner cases. This approach enhances the validation of robot policies and supports data or simulation augmentation, advancing scalable robot learning for improved generalization and robustness.

| **[X-Diffusion: Training Diffusion Policies on Cross-Embodiment Human Demonstrations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04671v1)** | 2025-11-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Human videos can be recorded quickly and at scale, making them an appealing source of training data for robot learning. However, humans and robots differ fundamentally in embodiment, resulting in mismatched action execution. Direct kinematic retargeting of human hand motion can therefore produce actions that are physically infeasible for robots. Despite these low-level differences, human demonstrations provide valuable motion cues about how to manipulate and interact with objects. Our key idea is to exploit the forward diffusion process: as noise is added to actions, low-level execution differences fade while high-level task guidance is preserved. We present X-Diffusion, a principled framework for training diffusion policies that maximally leverages human data without learning dynamically infeasible motions. X-Diffusion first trains a classifier to predict whether a noisy action is executed by a human or robot. Then, a human action is incorporated into policy training only after adding sufficient noise such that the classifier cannot discern its embodiment. Actions consistent with robot execution supervise fine-grained denoising at low noise levels, while mismatched human actions provide only coarse guidance at higher noise levels. Our experiments show that naive co-training under execution mismatches degrades policy performance, while X-Diffusion consistently improves it. Across five manipulation tasks, X-Diffusion achieves a 16% higher average success rate than the best baseline. The project website is available at https://portal-cornell.github.io/X-Diffusion/.</p></details> |  |

These issues lead to kinematic misalignments that degrade tracking performance and limit applicability in precision tasks. We propose a subject-specific calibration framework for exoskeleton-based hand tracking that estimates virtual link parameters through residual-weighted optimization. A data-driven approach is introduced to empirically tune cost function weights using motion capture ground truth, enabling accurate and consistent calibration across users. Implemented on the Maestro hand exoskeleton with seven healthy participants, the method achieved substantial reductions in joint and fingertip tracking errors across diverse hand geometries. Qualitative visualizations using a Unity-based virtual hand further demonstrate improved motion fidelity. The proposed framework generalizes to exoskeletons with closed-loop kinematics and minimal sensing, laying the foundation for high-fidelity teleoperation and robot learning applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 10 figures, 1 supplementary video, submitted to RA-L</p></details> |

However, state-of-the-art autoregressive VLAs struggle with multi-robot collaboration. We introduce embodiment transfer learning, denoted as ET-VLA, a novel framework for efficient and effective transfer of pre-trained VLAs to multi-robot. ET-VLA's core is Synthetic Continued Pretraining (SCP), which uses synthetically generated data to warm up the model for the new embodiment, bypassing the need for real human demonstrations and reducing data collection costs. SCP enables the model to learn correct actions and precise action token numbers. Following SCP, the model is fine-tuned on target embodiment data. To further enhance the model performance on multi-embodiment, we present the Embodied Graph-of-Thought technique, a novel approach that formulates each sub-task as a node, that allows the VLA model to distinguish the functionalities and roles of each embodiment during task execution. Our work considers bimanual robots, a simple version of multi-robot to verify our approaches. We validate the effectiveness of our method on both simulation benchmarks and real robots covering three different bimanual embodiments. In particular, our proposed ET-VLA \space can outperform OpenVLA on six real-world tasks over 53.2%. We will open-source all codes to support the community in advancing VLA models for robot learning.</p></details> |  |
| **[Learning from Watching: Scalable Extraction of Manipulation Trajectories from Human Videos](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00024v1)** | 2025-11-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Collecting high-quality data for training large-scale robotic models typically relies on real robot platforms, which is labor-intensive and costly, whether via teleoperation or scripted demonstrations. To scale data collection, many researchers have turned to leveraging human manipulation videos available online. However, current methods predominantly focus on hand detection or object pose estimation, failing to fully exploit the rich interaction cues embedded in these videos. In this work, we propose a novel approach that combines large foundation models for video understanding with point tracking techniques to extract dense trajectories of all task-relevant keypoints during manipulation. This enables more comprehensive utilization of Internet-scale human demonstration videos. Experimental results demonstrate that our method can accurately track keypoints throughout the entire manipulation process, paving the way for more scalable and data-efficient robot learning.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to RSS 2025 Workshop</p></details> |

Recent approaches leveraging video prediction models have shown promising results by learning rich spatiotemporal representations from large-scale datasets. However, these models learn action-agnostic dynamics that cannot distinguish between different control inputs, limiting their utility for precise manipulation tasks and requiring large pretraining datasets. We propose a Dynamics-Aligned Flow Matching Policy (DAP) that integrates dynamics prediction into policy learning. Our method introduces a novel architecture where policy and dynamics models provide mutual corrective feedback during action generation, enabling self-correction and improved generalization. Empirical validation demonstrates generalization performance superior to baseline methods on real-world robotic manipulation tasks, showing particular robustness in OOD scenarios including visual distractions and lighting variations.</p></details> | 9 pages, 6 figures |
| **[SARM: Stage-Aware Reward Modeling for Long Horizon Robot Manipulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25358v3)** | 2025-10-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large-scale robot learning has recently shown promise for enabling robots to perform complex tasks by integrating perception, control, and language understanding. Yet, it struggles with long-horizon, contact-rich manipulation such as deformable object handling, where demonstration quality is inconsistent. Reward modeling offers a natural solution: by providing grounded progress signals, it transforms noisy demonstrations into stable supervision that generalizes across diverse trajectories. We introduce a stage-aware, video-based reward modeling framework that jointly predicts high-level task stages and fine-grained progress. Reward labels are automatically derived from natural language subtask annotations, ensuring consistent progress estimation across variable-length demonstrations. This design overcomes frame-index labeling, which fails in variable-duration tasks like folding a T-shirt. Our reward model demonstrates robustness to variability, generalization to out-of-distribution settings, and strong utility for policy training. Building on it, we propose Reward-Aligned Behavior Cloning (RA-BC), which filters high-quality data and reweights samples by reward. Experiments show the reward model alone outperforms baselines on validation and real robot rollouts. Integrated into RA-BC, our approach achieves 83% success on folding T-shirts from the flattened state and 67% from the crumpled state -- far surpassing vanilla behavior cloning, which attains only 8% and 0% success. Overall, our results highlight reward modeling as a key enabler for scalable, annotation-efficient, and robust imitation learning in long-horizon manipulation.</p></details> |  |
| **[MoTVLA: A Vision-Language-Action Model with Unified Fast-Slow Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18337v3)** | 2025-10-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Integrating visual-language instructions into visuomotor policies is gaining momentum in robot learning for enhancing open-world generalization. Despite promising advances, existing approaches face two challenges: limited language steerability when no generated reasoning is used as a condition, or significant inference latency when reasoning is incorporated. In this work, we introduce MoTVLA, a mixture-of-transformers (MoT)-based vision-language-action (VLA) model that integrates fast-slow unified reasoning with behavior policy learning. MoTVLA preserves the general intelligence of pre-trained VLMs (serving as the generalist) for tasks such as perception, scene understanding, and semantic planning, while incorporating a domain expert, a second transformer that shares knowledge with the pretrained VLM, to generate domain-specific fast reasoning (e.g., robot motion decomposition), thereby improving policy execution efficiency. By conditioning the action expert on decomposed motion instructions, MoTVLA can learn diverse behaviors and substantially improve language steerability. Extensive evaluations across natural language processing benchmarks, robotic simulation environments, and real-world experiments confirm the superiority of MoTVLA in both fast-slow reasoning and manipulation task performance.</p></details> |  |

Each entry combines synchronized multi-view RGB-D, high-precision mocap with MANO hand parameters, and per-frame contact points with physically consistent force profiles. Our real-to-sim pipeline uses reinforcement learning to train policies that control an actuated MANO hand in physics simulation, reproducing human demonstrations while discovering the underlying contact forces that generate the observed object motion. DexCanvas is the first manipulation dataset to combine large-scale real demonstrations, systematic skill coverage based on established taxonomies, and physics-validated contact annotations. The dataset can facilitate research in robotic manipulation learning, contact-rich control, and skill transfer across different hand morphologies.</p></details> |  |
| **[Using Temperature Sampling to Effectively Train Robot Learning Policies on Imbalanced Datasets](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19373v1)** | 2025-10-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Increasingly large datasets of robot actions and sensory observations are being collected to train ever-larger neural networks. These datasets are collected based on tasks and while these tasks may be distinct in their descriptions, many involve very similar physical action sequences (e.g., 'pick up an apple' versus 'pick up an orange'). As a result, many datasets of robotic tasks are substantially imbalanced in terms of the physical robotic actions they represent. In this work, we propose a simple sampling strategy for policy training that mitigates this imbalance. Our method requires only a few lines of code to integrate into existing codebases and improves generalization. We evaluate our method in both pre-training small models and fine-tuning large foundational models. Our results show substantial improvements on low-resource tasks compared to prior state-of-the-art methods, without degrading performance on high-resource tasks. This enables more effective use of model capacity for multi-task policies. We also further validate our approach in a real-world setup on a Franka Panda robot arm across a diverse set of tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Efficient Model-Based Reinforcement Learning for Robot Control via Online Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18518v1)** | 2025-10-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present an online model-based reinforcement learning algorithm suitable for controlling complex robotic systems directly in the real world. Unlike prevailing sim-to-real pipelines that rely on extensive offline simulation and model-free policy optimization, our method builds a dynamics model from real-time interaction data and performs policy updates guided by the learned dynamics model. This efficient model-based reinforcement learning scheme significantly reduces the number of samples to train control policies, enabling direct training on real-world rollout data. This significantly reduces the influence of bias in the simulated data, and facilitates the search for high-performance control policies. We adopt online learning analysis to derive sublinear regret bounds under standard stochastic online optimization assumptions, providing formal guarantees on performance improvement as more interaction data are collected. Experimental evaluations were performed on a hydraulic excavator arm and a soft robot arm, where the algorithm demonstrates strong sample efficiency compared to model-free reinforcement learning methods, reaching comparable performance within hours. Robust adaptation to shifting dynamics was also observed when the payload condition was randomized. Our approach paves the way toward efficient and reliable on-robot learning for a broad class of challenging control tasks.</p></details> |  |

In particular, we are interested on quantifying the utility of contact-based data as contact holds significant information for robot learning. Our approach derives a contact-aware objective function for learning object dynamics and shape from pose and contact data. We show that the contact-aware Fisher-information metric can be used to rank and curate contact-data based on how informative data is for learning. In addition, we find that selecting a reduced dataset based on this ranking improves the learning task while also making learning a deterministic process. Interestingly, our results show that more data is not necessarily advantageous, and rather, less but informative data can accelerate learning, especially depending on the contact interactions. Last, we show how our metric can be used to provide initial guidance on data curation for contact-based robot learning.</p></details> |  |

While curated datasets can help, challenges remain in generalizability and real-world transfer. Meanwhile, large-scale "in-the-wild" video datasets have driven progress in computer vision through self-supervised techniques. Translating this to robotics, recent works have explored learning manipulation skills by passively watching abundant videos sourced online. Showing promising results, such video-based learning paradigms provide scalable supervision while reducing dataset bias. This survey reviews foundations such as video feature representation learning techniques, object affordance understanding, 3D hand/body modeling, and large-scale robot resources, as well as emerging techniques for acquiring robot manipulation skills from uncontrolled video demonstrations. We discuss how learning only from observing large-scale human videos can enhance generalization and sample efficiency for robotic manipulation.

| **[From Perception Logs to Failure Modes: Language-Driven Semantic Clustering of Failures for Robot Safety](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06570v2)** | 2025-10-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As robotic systems become increasingly integrated into real-world environments -- ranging from autonomous vehicles to household assistants -- they inevitably encounter diverse and unstructured scenarios that lead to failures. While such failures pose safety and reliability challenges, they also provide rich perceptual data for improving future performance. However, manually analyzing large-scale failure datasets is impractical. In this work, we present a method for automatically organizing large-scale robotic failure data into semantically meaningful failure clusters, enabling scalable learning from failure without human supervision. Our approach leverages the reasoning capabilities of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), trained on internet-scale data, to infer high-level failure causes from raw perceptual trajectories and discover interpretable structure within uncurated failure logs. These semantic clusters reveal patterns and hypothesized causes of failure, enabling scalable learning from experience. We demonstrate that the discovered failure modes can guide targeted data collection for policy refinement, accelerating iterative improvement in agent policies and overall safety. Additionally, we show that these semantic clusters can benefit online failure monitoring systems, offering a lightweight yet powerful safeguard for real-time operation. We demonstrate that this framework enhances robot learning and robustness by transforming real-world failures into actionable and interpretable signals for adaptation.</p></details> |  |

For robots, however, this capability remains a substantial challenge, as they cannot interpret abstract instructions and translate them into executable actions. In this paper, we present Manual2Skill, a novel framework that enables robots to perform complex assembly tasks guided by high-level manual instructions. Our approach leverages a Vision-Language Model (VLM) to extract structured information from instructional images and then uses this information to construct hierarchical assembly graphs. These graphs represent parts, subassemblies, and the relationships between them. To facilitate task execution, a pose estimation model predicts the relative 6D poses of components at each assembly step. At the same time, a motion planning module generates actionable sequences for real-world robotic implementation. We demonstrate the effectiveness of Manual2Skill by successfully assembling several real-world IKEA furniture items. This application highlights its ability to manage long-horizon manipulation tasks with both efficiency and precision, significantly enhancing the practicality of robot learning from instruction manuals. This work marks a step forward in advancing robotic systems capable of understanding and executing complex manipulation tasks in a manner akin to human capabilities.Project Page: https://owensun2004.github.io/Furniture-Assembly-Web/</p></details> |  |

While preference-based learning methods, such as reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF), enable this alignment, the choice of the preference collection interface may influence the process. Traditional 2D interfaces provide structured views but lack spatial depth, whereas immersive VR offers richer perception, potentially affecting preference articulation. This study systematically examines how the interface modality impacts human preference collection and navigation policy alignment. We introduce a novel dataset of 2,325 human preference queries collected through both VR and 2D interfaces, revealing significant differences in user experience, preference consistency, and policy outcomes. Our findings highlight the trade-offs between immersion, perception, and preference reliability, emphasizing the importance of interface selection in preference-based robot learning.

This success offers new promise for robotics, which has long been constrained by the high cost of action-labeled data. We ask: given the abundant video data containing interaction-related knowledge available as a rich "corpus", can a similar generative pre-training approach be effectively applied to enhance robot learning? The key challenge is to identify an effective representation for autoregressive pre-training that benefits robot manipulation tasks. Inspired by the way humans learn new skills through observing dynamic environments, we propose that effective robotic learning should emphasize motion-related knowledge, which is closely tied to low-level actions and is hardware-agnostic, facilitating the transfer of learned motions to actual robot actions. To this end, we introduce Moto, which converts video content into latent Motion Token sequences by a Latent Motion Tokenizer, learning a bridging "language" of motion from videos in an unsupervised manner. We pre-train Moto-GPT through motion token autoregression, enabling it to capture diverse visual motion knowledge. After pre-training, Moto-GPT demonstrates the promising ability to produce semantically interpretable motion tokens, predict plausible motion trajectories, and assess trajectory rationality through output likelihood. To transfer learned motion priors to real robot actions, we implement a co-fine-tuning strategy that seamlessly bridges latent motion token prediction and real robot control. Extensive experiments show that the fine-tuned Moto-GPT exhibits superior robustness and efficiency on robot manipulation benchmarks, underscoring its effectiveness in transferring knowledge from video data to downstream visual manipulation tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICCV ...</summary><p>ICCV 2025.

As its typical physical embodiment, humanoid robots have shown great promise through robot learning algorithms in recent years. In this study, a hardware platform, including humanoid robot and exoskeleton-style teleoperation cabin, was developed to realize intuitive remote manipulation and efficient collection of anthropomorphic action data. To improve the perception representation of humanoid robot, an imitation learning framework, termed Frequency-Enhanced Wavelet-based Transformer (FEWT), was proposed, which consists of two primary modules: Frequency-Enhanced Efficient Multi-Scale Attention (FE-EMA) and Time-Series Discrete Wavelet Transform (TS-DWT). By combining multi-scale wavelet decomposition with the residual network, FE-EMA can dynamically fuse features from both cross-spatial and frequency-domain. This fusion is able to capture feature information across various scales effectively, thereby enhancing model robustness. Experimental performance demonstrates that FEWT improves the success rate of the state-of-the-art algorithm (Action Chunking with Transformers, ACT baseline) by up to 30% in simulation and by 6-12% in real-world.</p></details> |  |
| **[Model-agnostic Adversarial Attack and Defense for Vision-Language-Action Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13237v1)** | 2025-10-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have achieved revolutionary progress in robot learning, enabling robots to execute complex physical robot tasks from natural language instructions. Despite this progress, their adversarial robustness remains underexplored. In this work, we propose both adversarial patch attack and corresponding defense strategies for VLA models. We first introduce the Embedding Disruption Patch Attack (EDPA), a model-agnostic adversarial attack that generates patches directly placeable within the camera's view. In comparison to prior methods, EDPA can be readily applied to different VLA models without requiring prior knowledge of the model architecture, or the controlled robotic manipulator. EDPA constructs these patches by (i) disrupting the semantic alignment between visual and textual latent representations, and (ii) maximizing the discrepancy of latent representations between adversarial and corresponding clean visual inputs. Through the optimization of these objectives, EDPA distorts the VLA's interpretation of visual information, causing the model to repeatedly generate incorrect actions and ultimately result in failure to complete the given robotic task. To counter this, we propose an adversarial fine-tuning scheme for the visual encoder, in which the encoder is optimized to produce similar latent representations for both clean and adversarially perturbed visual inputs. Extensive evaluations on the widely recognized LIBERO robotic simulation benchmark demonstrate that EDPA substantially increases the task failure rate of cutting-edge VLA models, while our proposed defense effectively mitigates this degradation.

This limitation stems not only from a conceptual gap but also from a fundamental computational barrier: prevailing architectures like Transformers are often constrained by quadratic complexity, rendering the processing of long, high-dimensional observation sequences infeasible. To overcome this dual challenge, we introduce Mamba Temporal Imitation Learning (MTIL). Our approach represents a new paradigm for robotic learning, which we frame as a practical synthesis of World Model and Dynamical System concepts. By leveraging the linear-time recurrent dynamics of State Space Models (SSMs), MTIL learns an implicit, action-oriented world model that efficiently encodes the entire trajectory history into a compressed, evolving state. This allows the policy to be conditioned on a comprehensive temporal context, transcending the confines of Markovian approaches. Through extensive experiments on simulated benchmarks (ACT, Robomimic, LIBERO) and on challenging real-world tasks, MTIL demonstrates superior performance against SOTA methods like ACT and Diffusion Policy, particularly in resolving long-term temporal ambiguities. Our findings not only affirm the necessity of full temporal context but also validate MTIL as a powerful and a computationally feasible approach for learning long-horizon, non-Markovian behaviors from high-dimensional observations.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters (RA-L), 2025. 8 pages, 5 figures</p></details> |

Recent GBC methods often employ diffusion policies with open-loop (OL) control, where actions are generated via a diffusion process and executed in multi-step chunks without replanning. While this approach has demonstrated strong success rates and generalization, its inherent stochasticity can result in erroneous action sampling, occasionally leading to unexpected task failures. Moreover, OL control suffers from delayed responses, which can degrade performance in noisy or dynamic environments. To address these limitations, we propose two novel techniques to enhance the consistency and reactivity of diffusion policies: (1) self-guidance, which improves action fidelity by leveraging past observations and implicitly promoting future-aware behavior; and (2) adaptive chunking, which selectively updates action sequences when the benefits of reactivity outweigh the need for temporal consistency. Extensive experiments show that our approach substantially improves GBC performance across a wide range of simulated and real-world robotic manipulation tasks.

While simulated data offers a scalable alternative, it often fails to generalize to the real world due to significant gaps in visual appearance, physical properties, and object interactions. To address this, we propose RoboSimGS, a novel Real2Sim2Real framework that converts multi-view real-world images into scalable, high-fidelity, and physically interactive simulation environments for robotic manipulation. Our approach reconstructs scenes using a hybrid representation: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) captures the photorealistic appearance of the environment, while mesh primitives for interactive objects ensure accurate physics simulation. Crucially, we pioneer the use of a Multi-modal Large Language Model (MLLM) to automate the creation of physically plausible, articulated assets. The MLLM analyzes visual data to infer not only physical properties (e.g., density, stiffness) but also complex kinematic structures (e.g., hinges, sliding rails) of objects. We demonstrate that policies trained entirely on data generated by RoboSimGS achieve successful zero-shot sim-to-real transfer across a diverse set of real-world manipulation tasks.

To facilitate and leverage the heterogeneity in rich, diverse robotic data sources, we propose a novel Soft Prompt approach with minimally added parameters, by infusing prompt learning concepts into cross-embodiment robot learning and introducing separate sets of learnable embeddings for each distinct data source. These embeddings serve as embodiment-specific prompts, which in unity empower VLA models with effective exploitation of varying cross-embodiment features. Our new X-VLA, a neat flow-matching-based VLA architecture, relies exclusively on soft-prompted standard Transformer encoders, enjoying both scalability and simplicity. Evaluated across 6 simulations as well as 3 real-world robots, our 0.9B instantiation-X-VLA-0.9B simultaneously achieves SOTA performance over a sweep of benchmarks, demonstrating superior results on a wide axes of capabilities, from flexible dexterity to quick adaptation across embodiments, environments, and tasks.

| **[DecisionLLM: Large Language Models for Long Sequence Decision Exploration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10148v1)** | 2026-01-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Long-sequence decision-making, which is usually addressed through reinforcement learning (RL), is a critical component for optimizing strategic operations in dynamic environments, such as real-time bidding in computational advertising. The Decision Transformer (DT) introduced a powerful paradigm by framing RL as an autoregressive sequence modeling problem. Concurrently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable success in complex reasoning and planning tasks. This inspires us whether LLMs, which share the same Transformer foundation, but operate at a much larger scale, can unlock new levels of performance in long-horizon sequential decision-making problem. This work investigates the application of LLMs to offline decision making tasks. A fundamental challenge in this domain is the LLMs' inherent inability to interpret continuous values, as they lack a native understanding of numerical magnitude and order when values are represented as text strings. To address this, we propose treating trajectories as a distinct modality. By learning to align trajectory data with natural language task descriptions, our model can autoregressively predict future decisions within a cohesive framework we term DecisionLLM. We establish a set of scaling laws governing this paradigm, demonstrating that performance hinges on three factors: model scale, data volume, and data quality. In offline experimental benchmarks and bidding scenarios, DecisionLLM achieves strong performance. Specifically, DecisionLLM-3B outperforms the traditional Decision Transformer (DT) by 69.4 on Maze2D umaze-v1 and by 0.085 on AuctionNet. It extends the AIGB paradigm and points to promising directions for future exploration in online bidding.</p></details> |  |
| **[Q-Regularized Generative Auto-Bidding: From Suboptimal Trajectories to Optimal Policies](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02754v1)** | 2026-01-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the rapid development of e-commerce, auto-bidding has become a key asset in optimizing advertising performance under diverse advertiser environments. The current approaches focus on reinforcement learning (RL) and generative models. These efforts imitate offline historical behaviors by utilizing a complex structure with expensive hyperparameter tuning. The suboptimal trajectories further exacerbate the difficulty of policy learning. To address these challenges, we proposes QGA, a novel Q-value regularized Generative Auto-bidding method. In QGA, we propose to plug a Q-value regularization with double Q-learning strategy into the Decision Transformer backbone. This design enables joint optimization of policy imitation and action-value maximization, allowing the learned bidding policy to both leverage experience from the dataset and alleviate the adverse impact of the suboptimal trajectories. Furthermore, to safely explore the policy space beyond the data distribution, we propose a Q-value guided dual-exploration mechanism, in which the DT model is conditioned on multiple return-to-go targets and locally perturbed actions. This entire exploration process is dynamically guided by the aforementioned Q-value module, which provides principled evaluation for each candidate action. Experiments on public benchmarks and simulation environments demonstrate that QGA consistently achieves superior or highly competitive results compared to existing alternatives. Notably, in large-scale real-world A/B testing, QGA achieves a 3.27% increase in Ad GMV and a 2.49% improvement in Ad ROI.</p></details> | <details><summary>11pag...</summary><p>11pages, 5figures, In Proceedings of the 32nd ACM SIGKDD Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining</p></details> |
| **[Online Finetuning Decision Transformers with Pure RL Gradients](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00167v1)** | 2026-01-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Decision Transformers (DTs) have emerged as a powerful framework for sequential decision making by formulating offline reinforcement learning (RL) as a sequence modeling problem. However, extending DTs to online settings with pure RL gradients remains largely unexplored, as existing approaches continue to rely heavily on supervised sequence-modeling objectives during online finetuning. We identify hindsight return relabeling -- a standard component in online DTs -- as a critical obstacle to RL-based finetuning: while beneficial for supervised learning, it is fundamentally incompatible with importance sampling-based RL algorithms such as GRPO, leading to unstable training. Building on this insight, we propose new algorithms that enable online finetuning of Decision Transformers using pure reinforcement learning gradients. We adapt GRPO to DTs and introduce several key modifications, including sub-trajectory optimization for improved credit assignment, sequence-level likelihood objectives for enhanced stability and efficiency, and active sampling to encourage exploration in uncertain regions. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that our methods outperform existing online DT baselines and achieve new state-of-the-art performance across multiple benchmarks, highlighting the effectiveness of pure-RL-based online finetuning for Decision Transformers.</p></details> |  |
| **[Quantum Decision Transformers (QDT): Synergistic Entanglement and Interference for Offline Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14726v1)** | 2025-12-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Offline reinforcement learning enables policy learning from pre-collected datasets without environment interaction, but existing Decision Transformer (DT) architectures struggle with long-horizon credit assignment and complex state-action dependencies. We introduce the Quantum Decision Transformer (QDT), a novel architecture incorporating quantum-inspired computational mechanisms to address these challenges. Our approach integrates two core components: Quantum-Inspired Attention with entanglement operations that capture non-local feature correlations, and Quantum Feedforward Networks with multi-path processing and learnable interference for adaptive computation. Through comprehensive experiments on continuous control tasks, we demonstrate over 2,000\% performance improvement compared to standard DTs, with superior generalization across varying data qualities. Critically, our ablation studies reveal strong synergistic effects between quantum-inspired components: neither alone achieves competitive performance, yet their combination produces dramatic improvements far exceeding individual contributions. This synergy demonstrates that effective quantum-inspired architecture design requires holistic co-design of interdependent mechanisms rather than modular component adoption. Our analysis identifies three key computational advantages: enhanced credit assignment through non-local correlations, implicit ensemble behavior via parallel processing, and adaptive resource allocation through learnable interference. These findings establish quantum-inspired design principles as a promising direction for advancing transformer architectures in sequential decision-making, with implications extending beyond reinforcement learning to neural architecture design more broadly.</p></details> |  |
| **[Benchmarking Offline Multi-Objective Reinforcement Learning in Critical Care](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08012v1)** | 2025-12-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In critical care settings such as the Intensive Care Unit, clinicians face the complex challenge of balancing conflicting objectives, primarily maximizing patient survival while minimizing resource utilization (e.g., length of stay). Single-objective Reinforcement Learning approaches typically address this by optimizing a fixed scalarized reward function, resulting in rigid policies that fail to adapt to varying clinical priorities. Multi-objective Reinforcement Learning (MORL) offers a solution by learning a set of optimal policies along the Pareto Frontier, allowing for dynamic preference selection at test time. However, applying MORL in healthcare necessitates strict offline learning from historical data. In this paper, we benchmark three offline MORL algorithms, Conditioned Conservative Pareto Q-Learning (CPQL), Adaptive CPQL, and a modified Pareto Efficient Decision Agent (PEDA) Decision Transformer (PEDA DT), against three scalarized single-objective baselines (BC, CQL, and DDQN) on the MIMIC-IV dataset. Using Off-Policy Evaluation (OPE) metrics, we demonstrate that PEDA DT algorithm offers superior flexibility compared to static scalarized baselines. Notably, our results extend previous findings on single-objective Decision Transformers in healthcare, confirming that sequence modeling architectures remain robust and effective when scaled to multi-objective conditioned generation. These findings suggest that offline MORL is a promising framework for enabling personalized, adjustable decision-making in critical care without the need for retraining.</p></details> |  |
| **[Data Fusion-Enhanced Decision Transformer for Stable Cross-Domain Generalization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09173v2)** | 2025-12-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Cross-domain shifts present a significant challenge for decision transformer (DT) policies. Existing cross-domain policy adaptation methods typically rely on a single simple filtering criterion to select source trajectory fragments and stitch them together. They match either state structure or action feasibility. However, the selected fragments still have poor stitchability: state structures can misalign, the return-to-go (RTG) becomes incomparable when the reward or horizon changes, and actions may jump at trajectory junctions. As a result, RTG tokens lose continuity, which compromises DT's inference ability. To tackle these challenges, we propose Data Fusion-Enhanced Decision Transformer (DFDT), a compact pipeline that restores stitchability. Particularly, DFDT fuses scarce target data with selectively trusted source fragments via a two-level data filter, maximum mean discrepancy (MMD) mismatch for state-structure alignment, and optimal transport (OT) deviation for action feasibility. It then trains on a feasibility-weighted fusion distribution. Furthermore, DFDT replaces RTG tokens with advantage-conditioned tokens, which improves the continuity of the semantics in the token sequence. It also applies a $Q$-guided regularizer to suppress junction value and action jumps. Theoretically, we provide bounds that tie state value and policy performance gaps to the MMD-mismatch and OT-deviation measures, and show that the bounds tighten as these two measures shrink. We show that DFDT improves return and stability over strong offline RL and sequence-model baselines across gravity, kinematic, and morphology shifts on D4RL-style control tasks, and further corroborate these gains with token-stitching and sequence-semantics stability analyses.</p></details> | 32 pages,4 figures |
| **[Hybrid Quantum-Classical Ensemble Learning for S\&P 500 Directional Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15738v1)** | 2025-12-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Financial market prediction is a challenging application of machine learning, where even small improvements in directional accuracy can yield substantial value. Most models struggle to exceed 55--57\% accuracy due to high noise, non-stationarity, and market efficiency. We introduce a hybrid ensemble framework combining quantum sentiment analysis, Decision Transformer architecture, and strategic model selection, achieving 60.14\% directional accuracy on S\&P 500 prediction, a 3.10\% improvement over individual models. Our framework addresses three limitations of prior approaches. First, architecture diversity dominates dataset diversity: combining different learning algorithms (LSTM, Decision Transformer, XGBoost, Random Forest, Logistic Regression) on the same data outperforms training identical architectures on multiple datasets (60.14\% vs.\ 52.80\%), confirmed by correlation analysis ($r>0.6$ among same-architecture models). Second, a 4-qubit variational quantum circuit enhances sentiment analysis, providing +0.8\% to +1.5\% gains per model. Third, smart filtering excludes weak predictors (accuracy $<52\%$), improving ensemble performance (Top-7 models: 60.14\% vs.\ all 35 models: 51.2\%). We evaluate on 2020--2023 market data across seven instruments, covering diverse regimes including the COVID-19 crash and inflation-driven correction. McNemar's test confirms statistical significance ($p<0.05$). Preliminary backtesting with confidence-based filtering (6+ model consensus) yields a Sharpe ratio of 1.2 versus buy-and-hold's 0.8, demonstrating practical trading potential.</p></details> |  |
| **[Pre-trained Language Models Improve the Few-shot Prompt Ability of Decision Transformer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01402v2)** | 2025-12-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Decision Transformer (DT) has emerged as a promising class of algorithms in offline reinforcement learning (RL) tasks, leveraging pre-collected datasets and Transformer's capability to model long sequences. Recent works have demonstrated that using parts of trajectories from training tasks as prompts in DT enhances its performance on unseen tasks, giving rise to Prompt-DT methods. However, collecting data from specific environments can be both costly and unsafe in many scenarios, leading to suboptimal performance and limited few-shot prompt abilities due to the data-hungry nature of Transformer-based models. Additionally, the limited datasets used in pre-training make it challenging for Prompt-DT type of methods to distinguish between various RL tasks through prompts alone. To address these challenges, we introduce the Language model-initialized Prompt Decision Transformer (LPDT) framework, which leverages pretrained language models providing rich prior knowledge for RL tasks and fine-tunes the sequence model using Low-rank Adaptation (LoRA) for meta-RL problems. We further incorporate prompt regularization to effectively differentiate between tasks based on prompt feature representations. Comprehensive empirical studies demonstrate that initializing with a pre-trained language model provides the prior knowledge and achieves a similar performance with Prompt-DT under only $10\%$ data in some MuJoCo control tasks. We also provide a thorough ablation study to validate the effectiveness of each component, including sequence modeling, language models, prompt regularizations, and prompt strategies.</p></details> | <details><summary>2 fig...</summary><p>2 figures, 10 tables.

| **[DeepFleet: Multi-Agent Foundation Models for Mobile Robots](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08574v2)** | 2025-11-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce DeepFleet, a suite of foundation models designed to support coordination and planning for large-scale mobile robot fleets. These models are trained on fleet movement data, including robot positions, goals, and interactions, from hundreds of thousands of robots in Amazon warehouses worldwide. DeepFleet consists of four architectures that each embody a distinct inductive bias and collectively explore key points in the design space for multi-agent foundation models: the robot-centric (RC) model is an autoregressive decision transformer operating on neighborhoods of individual robots; the robot-floor (RF) model uses a transformer with cross-attention between robots and the warehouse floor; the image-floor (IF) model applies convolutional encoding to a multi-channel image representation of the full fleet; and the graph-floor (GF) model combines temporal attention with graph neural networks for spatial relationships. In this paper, we describe these models and present our evaluation of the impact of these design choices on prediction task performance. We find that the robot-centric and graph-floor models, which both use asynchronous robot state updates and incorporate the localized structure of robot interactions, show the most promise. We also present experiments that show that these two models can make effective use of larger warehouses operation datasets as the models are scaled up.</p></details> | <details><summary>27 pa...</summary><p>27 pages, 10 figures, 2 tables</p></details> |
| **[A Comparison Between Decision Transformers and Traditional Offline Reinforcement Learning Algorithms](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16475v1)** | 2025-11-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The field of Offline Reinforcement Learning (RL) aims to derive effective policies from pre-collected datasets without active environment interaction. While traditional offline RL algorithms like Conservative Q-Learning (CQL) and Implicit Q-Learning (IQL) have shown promise, they often face challenges in balancing exploration and exploitation, especially in environments with varying reward densities. The recently proposed Decision Transformer (DT) approach, which reframes offline RL as a sequence modelling problem, has demonstrated impressive results across various benchmarks. This paper presents a comparative study evaluating the performance of DT against traditional offline RL algorithms in dense and sparse reward settings for the ANT continous control environment. Our research investigates how these algorithms perform when faced with different reward structures, examining their ability to learn effective policies and generalize across varying levels of feedback. Through empirical analysis in the ANT environment, we found that DTs showed less sensitivity to varying reward density compared to other methods and particularly excelled with medium-expert datasets in sparse reward scenarios. In contrast, traditional value-based methods like IQL showed improved performance in dense reward settings with high-quality data, while CQL offered balanced performance across different data qualities. Additionally, DTs exhibited lower variance in performance but required significantly more computational resources compared to traditional approaches. These findings suggest that sequence modelling approaches may be more suitable for scenarios with uncertain reward structures or mixed-quality data, while value-based methods remain competitive in settings with dense rewards and high-quality demonstrations.</p></details> | <details><summary>15 pa...</summary><p>15 pages, 4 figures, published in the Proceedings of the 46th Annual conference of the South African Institute of Computer Scientists and Information Technologists (SIACSIT 2025)</p></details> |
| **[Toward Explainable Offline RL: Analyzing Representations in Intrinsically Motivated Decision Transformers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13958v2)** | 2025-11-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Elastic Decision Transformers (EDTs) have proved to be particularly successful in offline reinforcement learning, offering a flexible framework that unifies sequence modeling with decision-making under uncertainty. Recent research has shown that incorporating intrinsic motivation mechanisms into EDTs improves performance across exploration tasks, yet the representational mechanisms underlying these improvements remain unexplored. In this paper, we introduce a systematic post-hoc explainability framework to analyze how intrinsic motivation shapes learned embeddings in EDTs. Through statistical analysis of embedding properties (including covariance structure, vector magnitudes, and orthogonality), we reveal that different intrinsic motivation variants create fundamentally different representational structures. Our analysis demonstrates environment-specific correlation patterns between embedding metrics and performance that explain why intrinsic motivation improves policy learning. These findings show that intrinsic motivation operates beyond simple exploration bonuses, acting as a representational prior that shapes embedding geometry in biologically plausible ways, creating environment-specific organizational structures that facilitate better decision-making.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for poster presentation at the NeurIPS 2025 workshop "CogInterp: Interpreting Cognition in Deep Learning Models", San Diego, CA, USA</p></details> |
| **[Soft Conflict-Resolution Decision Transformer for Offline Multi-Task Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13133v1)** | 2025-11-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-task reinforcement learning (MTRL) seeks to learn a unified policy for diverse tasks, but often suffers from gradient conflicts across tasks. Existing masking-based methods attempt to mitigate such conflicts by assigning task-specific parameter masks. However, our empirical study shows that coarse-grained binary masks have the problem of over-suppressing key conflicting parameters, hindering knowledge sharing across tasks. Moreover, different tasks exhibit varying conflict levels, yet existing methods use a one-size-fits-all fixed sparsity strategy to keep training stability and performance, which proves inadequate. These limitations hinder the model's generalization and learning efficiency. To address these issues, we propose SoCo-DT, a Soft Conflict-resolution method based by parameter importance. By leveraging Fisher information, mask values are dynamically adjusted to retain important parameters while suppressing conflicting ones. In addition, we introduce a dynamic sparsity adjustment strategy based on the Interquartile Range (IQR), which constructs task-specific thresholding schemes using the distribution of conflict and harmony scores during training. To enable adaptive sparsity evolution throughout training, we further incorporate an asymmetric cosine annealing schedule to continuously update the threshold. Experimental results on the Meta-World benchmark show that SoCo-DT outperforms the state-of-the-art method by 7.6% on MT50 and by 10.5% on the suboptimal dataset, demonstrating its effectiveness in mitigating gradient conflicts and improving overall multi-task performance.</p></details> |  |

While ARC has inspired extensive research on abstract reasoning, most existing approaches rely on static input--output supervision, which limits insight into how reasoning unfolds over time. ARCTraj addresses this gap by recording temporally ordered, object-level actions that capture how humans iteratively transform inputs into outputs, revealing intermediate reasoning steps that conventional datasets overlook. Collected via the O2ARC web interface, it contains around 10,000 trajectories annotated with task identifiers, timestamps, and success labels across 400 training tasks from the ARC-AGI-1 benchmark. It further defines a unified reasoning pipeline encompassing data collection, action abstraction, Markov decision process (MDP) formulation, and downstream learning, enabling integration with reinforcement learning, generative modeling, and sequence modeling methods such as PPO, World Models, GFlowNets, Diffusion agents, and Decision Transformers. Analyses of spatial selection, color attribution, and strategic convergence highlight the structure and diversity of human reasoning. Together, these contributions position ARCTraj as a structured and interpretable foundation for studying human-like reasoning, advancing explainability, alignment, and generalizable intelligence.</p></details> |  |

These algorithms performed competitively across various benchmarks, from games to robotic tasks, but their theoretical understanding is limited to specific environmental conditions. This work initiates a theoretical foundation for algorithms that build on the broad paradigm of approaching reinforcement learning through supervised learning or sequence modeling. At the core of this investigation lies the analysis of conditions on the underlying environment, under which the algorithms can identify optimal solutions. We also assess whether emerging solutions remain stable in situations where the environment is subject to tiny levels of noise. Specifically, we study the continuity and asymptotic convergence of command-conditioned policies, values and the goal-reaching objective depending on the transition kernel of the underlying Markov Decision Process. We demonstrate that near-optimal behavior is achieved if the transition kernel is located in a sufficiently small neighborhood of a deterministic kernel. The mentioned quantities are continuous (with respect to a specific topology) at deterministic kernels, both asymptotically and after a finite number of learning cycles. The developed methods allow us to present the first explicit estimates on the convergence and stability of policies and values in terms of the underlying transition kernels. On the theoretical side we introduce a number of new concepts to reinforcement learning, like working in segment spaces, studying continuity in quotient topologies and the application of the fixed-point theory of dynamical systems. The theoretical study is accompanied by a detailed investigation of example environments and numerical experiments.</p></details> | <details><summary>85 pa...</summary><p>85 pages in main text + 4 pages of references + 26 pages of appendices, 12 figures in main text + 2 figures in appendices; source code available at https://github.com/struplm/eUDRL-GCSL-ODT-Convergence-public</p></details> |
| **[Unified token representations for sequential decision models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21448v1)** | 2025-10-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Transformers have demonstrated strong potential in offline reinforcement learning (RL) by modeling trajectories as sequences of return-to-go, states, and actions. However, existing approaches such as the Decision Transformer(DT) and its variants suffer from redundant tokenization and quadratic attention complexity, limiting their scalability in real-time or resource-constrained settings. To address this, we propose a Unified Token Representation (UTR) that merges return-to-go, state, and action into a single token, substantially reducing sequence length and model complexity. Theoretical analysis shows that UTR leads to a tighter Rademacher complexity bound, suggesting improved generalization. We further develop two variants: UDT and UDC, built upon transformer and gated CNN backbones, respectively. Both achieve comparable or superior performance to state-of-the-art methods with markedly lower computation. These findings demonstrate that UTR generalizes well across architectures and may provide an efficient foundation for scalable control in future large decision models.</p></details> |  |

Modern decision Transformers - trained similarly to LLMs - are able to learn competent gameplay, but it is unclear to what extent they truly capture the rules of chess. To investigate this, we train a 270M parameter chess Transformer and test it on out-of-distribution scenarios, designed to reveal failures of systematic generalization. Our analysis shows that Transformers exhibit compositional generalization, as evidenced by strong rule extrapolation: they adhere to fundamental syntactic rules of the game by consistently choosing valid moves even in situations very different from the training data. Moreover, they also generate high-quality moves for OOD puzzles. In a more challenging test, we evaluate the models on variants including Chess960 (Fischer Random Chess) - a variant of chess where starting positions of pieces are randomized. We found that while the model exhibits basic strategy adaptation, they are inferior to symbolic AI algorithms that perform explicit search, but gap is smaller when playing against users on Lichess. Moreover, the training dynamics revealed that the model initially learns to move only its own pieces, suggesting an emergent compositional understanding of the game.</p></details> |  |

The tasks share a common structure and an algorithm should exploit the shared structure to minimize the cumulative regret for an unseen but related test task. We use a transformer as a decision-making algorithm to learn this shared structure from data collected by a demonstrator on a set of training task instances. Our objective is to devise a training procedure such that the transformer will learn to outperform the demonstrator's learning algorithm on unseen test task instances. Prior work on pretraining decision transformers either requires privileged information like access to optimal arms or cannot outperform the demonstrator. Going beyond these approaches, we introduce a pre-training approach that trains a transformer network to learn a near-optimal policy in-context. This approach leverages the shared structure across tasks, does not require access to optimal actions, and can outperform the demonstrator. We validate these claims over a wide variety of structured bandit problems to show that our proposed solution is general and can quickly identify expected rewards on unseen test tasks to support effective exploration.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in Reinforcement Learning Conference 2025</p></details> |

Yet, the adversarial robustness of reinforcement learning methods based on sequence modeling remains largely unexplored. Here we introduce the Conservative Adversarially Robust Decision Transformer (CART), to our knowledge the first framework designed to enhance the robustness of DT in adversarial stochastic games. We formulate the interaction between the protagonist and the adversary at each stage as a stage game, where the payoff is defined as the expected maximum value over subsequent states, thereby explicitly incorporating stochastic state transitions. By conditioning Transformer policies on the NashQ value derived from these stage games, CART generates policy that are simultaneously less exploitable (adversarially robust) and conservative to transition uncertainty. Empirically, CART achieves more accurate minimax value estimation and consistently attains superior worst-case returns across a range of adversarial stochastic games.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by Reliable ML Workshop @ NeurIPS 2025</p></details> |

In this paper, we introduce MDT4Rec, an offline RLRS framework that builds on the Decision Transformer (DT) to address two major challenges: learning from sub-optimal histories and representing complex user-item interactions. First, MDT4Rec shifts the trajectory stitching procedure from the training phase to action inference, allowing the system to shorten its historical context when necessary and thereby ignore negative or unsuccessful past experiences. Second, MDT4Rec initializes DT with a pre-trained large language model (LLM) for knowledge transfer, replaces linear embedding layers with Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs) for more flexible representations, and employs Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) to efficiently fine-tune only a small subset of parameters. We evaluate MDT4Rec on five public datasets and in an online simulation environment, demonstrating that it outperforms existing methods.</p></details> | CIKM'25 |
| **[Adjusting the Output of Decision Transformer with Action Gradient](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05285v1)** | 2025-10-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Decision Transformer (DT), which integrates reinforcement learning (RL) with the transformer model, introduces a novel approach to offline RL. Unlike classical algorithms that take maximizing cumulative discounted rewards as objective, DT instead maximizes the likelihood of actions. This paradigm shift, however, presents two key challenges: stitching trajectories and extrapolation of action. Existing methods, such as substituting specific tokens with predictive values and integrating the Policy Gradient (PG) method, address these challenges individually but fail to improve performance stably when combined due to inherent instability. To address this, we propose Action Gradient (AG), an innovative methodology that directly adjusts actions to fulfill a function analogous to that of PG, while also facilitating efficient integration with token prediction techniques. AG utilizes the gradient of the Q-value with respect to the action to optimize the action. The empirical results demonstrate that our method can significantly enhance the performance of DT-based algorithms, with some results achieving state-of-the-art levels.</p></details> |  |

The Prompting Decision Transformer (PDT) enables task generalization via trajectory prompts sampled uniformly from expert demonstrations -- without accounting for prompt informativeness. In this work, we propose a bandit-based prompt-tuning method that learns to construct optimal trajectory prompts from demonstration data at inference time. We devise a structured bandit architecture operating in the trajectory prompt space, achieving linear rather than combinatorial scaling with prompt size. Additionally, we show that the pre-trained PDT itself can serve as a powerful feature extractor for the bandit, enabling efficient reward modeling across various environments. We theoretically establish regret bounds and demonstrate empirically that our method consistently enhances performance across a wide range of tasks, high-dimensional environments, and out-of-distribution scenarios, outperforming existing baselines in prompt tuning.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at NeurIPS 2025</p></details> |

However, it's pretty challenging to meet various prerequisites utilizing traditional control methods. Therefore, we propose an effective two-stage learning from demonstrations training framework, FISHER, to highlight the adaptability of reinforcement learning (RL) methods in the multi-AUV underwater target tracking task, while addressing its limitations such as extensive requirements for environmental interactions and the challenges in designing reward functions. The first stage utilizes imitation learning (IL) to realize policy improvement and generate offline datasets. To be specific, we introduce multi-agent discriminator-actor-critic based on improvements of the generative adversarial IL algorithm and multi-agent IL optimization objective derived from the Nash equilibrium condition. Then in the second stage, we develop multi-agent independent generalized decision transformer, which analyzes the latent representation to match the future states of high-quality samples rather than reward function, attaining further enhanced policies capable of handling various scenarios. Besides, we propose a simulation to simulation demonstration generation procedure to facilitate the generation of expert demonstrations in underwater environments, which capitalizes on traditional control methods and can easily accomplish the domain transfer to obtain demonstrations. Extensive simulation experiments from multiple scenarios showcase that FISHER possesses strong stability, multi-task performance and capability of generalization.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been accepted by IEEE Transactions on Mobile Computing.

| **[Double Check My Desired Return: Transformer with Target Alignment for Offline Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16420v2)** | 2025-09-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Offline reinforcement learning (RL) has achieved significant advances in domains such as robotic control, autonomous driving, and medical decision-making. Most existing methods primarily focus on training policies that maximize cumulative returns from a given dataset. However, many real-world applications require precise control over policy performance levels, rather than simply pursuing the best possible return. Reinforcement learning via supervised learning (RvS) frames offline RL as a sequence modeling task, enabling the extraction of diverse policies by conditioning on different desired returns. Yet, existing RvS-based transformers, such as Decision Transformer (DT), struggle to reliably align the actual achieved returns with specified target returns, especially when interpolating within underrepresented returns or extrapolating beyond the dataset. To address this limitation, we propose Doctor, a novel approach that Double Checks the Transformer with target alignment for Offline RL. Doctor integrates the strengths of supervised learning (SL) and temporal difference (TD) learning by jointly optimizing the action prediction and value estimation. During inference, Doctor introduces a double-check mechanism: actions are first sampled around the desired target returns and then validated with value functions. This ensures more accurate alignment between predicted actions and desired target returns. We evaluate Doctor on the D4RL and EpiCare benchmarks, demonstrating aligned control yields stronger performance and tunable expertise, showing its effectiveness in a wide range of tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Multi-Agent Path Finding via Offline RL and LLM Collaboration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22130v1)** | 2025-09-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-Agent Path Finding (MAPF) poses a significant and challenging problem critical for applications in robotics and logistics, particularly due to its combinatorial complexity and the partial observability inherent in realistic environments. Decentralized reinforcement learning methods commonly encounter two substantial difficulties: first, they often yield self-centered behaviors among agents, resulting in frequent collisions, and second, their reliance on complex communication modules leads to prolonged training times, sometimes spanning weeks. To address these challenges, we propose an efficient decentralized planning framework based on the Decision Transformer (DT), uniquely leveraging offline reinforcement learning to substantially reduce training durations from weeks to mere hours. Crucially, our approach effectively handles long-horizon credit assignment and significantly improves performance in scenarios with sparse and delayed rewards. Furthermore, to overcome adaptability limitations inherent in standard RL methods under dynamic environmental changes, we integrate a large language model (GPT-4o) to dynamically guide agent policies. Extensive experiments in both static and dynamically changing environments demonstrate that our DT-based approach, augmented briefly by GPT-4o, significantly enhances adaptability and performance.</p></details> |  |

This study introduces GNN-DT, a novel Decision Transformer (DT) architecture that integrates Graph Neural Network (GNN) embedders with a novel residual connection between input and output tokens crucial for handling dynamic environments. By learning from previously collected trajectories, GNN-DT tackles the sparse rewards limitations of online RL algorithms and delivers high-quality solutions in real-time. We evaluate GNN-DT on the complex electric vehicle (EV) charging optimization problem and prove that its performance is superior and requires significantly fewer training trajectories, thus improving sample efficiency compared to existing DT and offline RL baselines. Furthermore, GNN-DT exhibits robust generalization to unseen environments and larger action spaces, addressing a critical gap in prior offline and online RL approaches.</p></details> |  |
| **[Large Language Model-Empowered Decision Transformer for UAV-Enabled Data Collection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13934v2)** | 2025-09-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The deployment of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) for reliable and energy-efficient data collection from spatially distributed devices holds great promise in supporting diverse Internet of Things (IoT) applications. Nevertheless, the limited endurance and communication range of UAVs necessitate intelligent trajectory planning. While reinforcement learning (RL) has been extensively explored for UAV trajectory optimization, its interactive nature entails high costs and risks in real-world environments. Offline RL mitigates these issues but remains susceptible to unstable training and heavily rely on expert-quality datasets. To address these challenges, we formulate a joint UAV trajectory planning and resource allocation problem to maximize energy efficiency of data collection. The resource allocation subproblem is first transformed into an equivalent linear programming formulation and solved optimally with polynomial-time complexity. Then, we propose a large language model (LLM)-empowered critic-regularized decision transformer (DT) framework, termed LLM-CRDT, to learn effective UAV control policies. In LLM-CRDT, we incorporate critic networks to regularize the DT model training, thereby integrating the sequence modeling capabilities of DT with critic-based value guidance to enable learning effective policies from suboptimal datasets. Furthermore, to mitigate the data-hungry nature of transformer models, we employ a pre-trained LLM as the transformer backbone of the DT model and adopt a parameter-efficient fine-tuning strategy, i.e., LoRA, enabling rapid adaptation to UAV control tasks with small-scale dataset and low computational overhead. Extensive simulations demonstrate that LLM-CRDT outperforms benchmark online and offline RL methods, achieving up to 36.7\% higher energy efficiency than the current state-of-the-art DT approaches.</p></details> | 14pages, 8 figures |
| **[Mental Accounts for Actions: EWA-Inspired Attention in Decision Transformers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15498v1)** | 2025-09-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Transformers have emerged as a compelling architecture for sequential decision-making by modeling trajectories via self-attention. In reinforcement learning (RL), they enable return-conditioned control without relying on value function approximation. Decision Transformers (DTs) exploit this by casting RL as supervised sequence modeling, but they are restricted to offline data and lack exploration. Online Decision Transformers (ODTs) address this limitation through entropy-regularized training on on-policy rollouts, offering a stable alternative to traditional RL methods like Soft Actor-Critic, which depend on bootstrapped targets and reward shaping. Despite these advantages, ODTs use standard attention, which lacks explicit memory of action-specific outcomes. This leads to inefficiencies in learning long-term action effectiveness. Inspired by cognitive models such as Experience-Weighted Attraction (EWA), we propose Experience-Weighted Attraction with Vector Quantization for Online Decision Transformers (EWA-VQ-ODT), a lightweight module that maintains per-action mental accounts summarizing recent successes and failures. Continuous actions are routed via direct grid lookup to a compact vector-quantized codebook, where each code stores a scalar attraction updated online through decay and reward-based reinforcement. These attractions modulate attention by biasing the columns associated with action tokens, requiring no change to the backbone or training objective. On standard continuous-control benchmarks, EWA-VQ-ODT improves sample efficiency and average return over ODT, particularly in early training. The module is computationally efficient, interpretable via per-code traces, and supported by theoretical guarantees that bound the attraction dynamics and its impact on attention drift.</p></details> |  |

However, it struggles to learn optimal policies from suboptimal, reward-labelled trajectories. In this study, we explore the use of conditional generative modelling to facilitate trajectory stitching given its high-quality data generation ability. Additionally, recent advancements in Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) have shown their linear complexity and competitive sequence modelling performance over Transformers. We leverage the Test-Time Training (TTT) layer, an RNN that updates hidden states during testing, to model trajectories in the form of DT. We introduce a unified framework, called Diffusion-Refined Decision TTT (DRDT3), to achieve performance beyond DT models. Specifically, we propose the Decision TTT (DT3) module, which harnesses the sequence modelling strengths of both self-attention and the TTT layer to capture recent contextual information and make coarse action predictions. DRDT3 iteratively refines the coarse action predictions through the generative diffusion model, progressively moving closer to the optimal actions. We further integrate DT3 with the diffusion model using a unified optimization objective. With experiments on multiple tasks in the D4RL benchmark, our DT3 model without diffusion refinement demonstrates improved performance over standard DT, while DRDT3 further achieves superior results compared to state-of-the-art DT-based and offline RL methods.</p></details> |  |

We also test if we can accelerate the novelty-based training of these larger models by seeding the training with a pretrained models. The experimental results were mixed. NS-ES showed progress, but it would clearly need many more iterations for it to yield interesting agents. NSR-ES, on the other hand, proved quite capable of being straightforwardly used on larger models, since its performance appears as similar between the feed-forward model and Decision Transformer, as it was for the OpenAI-ES in our previous work.</p></details> |  |
| **[An Uncertainty-Weighted Decision Transformer for Navigation in Dense, Complex Driving Scenarios](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13132v1)** | 2025-09-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Autonomous driving in dense, dynamic environments requires decision-making systems that can exploit both spatial structure and long-horizon temporal dependencies while remaining robust to uncertainty. This work presents a novel framework that integrates multi-channel bird's-eye-view occupancy grids with transformer-based sequence modeling for tactical driving in complex roundabout scenarios. To address the imbalance between frequent low-risk states and rare safety-critical decisions, we propose the Uncertainty-Weighted Decision Transformer (UWDT). UWDT employs a frozen teacher transformer to estimate per-token predictive entropy, which is then used as a weight in the student model's loss function. This mechanism amplifies learning from uncertain, high-impact states while maintaining stability across common low-risk transitions. Experiments in a roundabout simulator, across varying traffic densities, show that UWDT consistently outperforms other baselines in terms of reward, collision rate, and behavioral stability. The results demonstrate that uncertainty-aware, spatial-temporal transformers can deliver safer and more efficient decision-making for autonomous driving in complex traffic environments.</p></details> |  |
| **[Kalman Bayesian Transformer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10695v1)** | 2025-09-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Sequential fine-tuning of transformers is useful when new data arrive sequentially, especially with shifting distributions. Unlike batch learning, sequential learning demands that training be stabilized despite a small amount of data by balancing new information and previously learned knowledge in the pre-trained models. This challenge is further complicated when training is to be completed in latency-critical environments and learning must additionally quantify and be mediated by uncertainty. Motivated by these challenges, we propose a novel method that frames sequential fine-tuning as a posterior inference problem within a Bayesian framework. Our approach integrates closed-form moment propagation of random variables, Kalman Bayesian Neural Networks, and Taylor approximations of the moments of softmax functions. By explicitly accounting for pre-trained models as priors and adaptively balancing them against new information based on quantified uncertainty, our method achieves robust and data-efficient sequential learning. The effectiveness of our method is demonstrated through numerical simulations involving sequential adaptation of a decision transformer to tasks characterized by distribution shifts and limited memory resources.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to the 64th IEEE Conference on Decision and Control (CDC 2025)</p></details> |

In our work, we propose a novel solution - the Progressive Prompt Decision Transformer (P2DT). This method enhances a transformer-based model by dynamically appending decision tokens during new task training, thus fostering task-specific policies. Our approach mitigates forgetting in continual and offline reinforcement learning scenarios. Moreover, P2DT leverages trajectories collected via traditional reinforcement learning from all tasks and generates new task-specific tokens during training, thereby retaining knowledge from previous studies. Preliminary results demonstrate that our model effectively alleviates catastrophic forgetting and scales well with increasing task environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by the 49th IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing (ICASSP 2024)</p></details> |

Optimizing their delivery involves addressing complex sequential decision-making challenges under constraints such as message utility and user fatigue. Offline reinforcement learning (RL) methods, such as Conservative Q-Learning (CQL), have been applied to this problem but face practical challenges at scale, including instability, sensitivity to distribution shifts, limited reproducibility, and difficulties with explainability in high-dimensional recommendation settings. We present a Decision Transformer (DT) based framework that reframes policy learning as return-conditioned supervised learning, improving robustness, scalability, and modeling flexibility. Our contributions include a real-world comparison with CQL, a multi-reward design suitable for non-episodic tasks, a quantile regression approach to return-to-go conditioning, and a production-ready system with circular buffer-based sequence processing for near-real-time inference. Extensive offline and online experiments in a deployed notification system show that our approach improves notification utility and overall session activity while minimizing user fatigue. Compared to a multi-objective CQL-based agent, the DT-based approach achieved a +0.72% increase in sessions for notification decision-making at LinkedIn by making notification recommendation more relevant.</p></details> |  |
| **[Learning to Ask: Decision Transformers for Adaptive Quantitative Group Testing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01723v1)** | 2025-09-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We consider the problem of quantitative group testing (QGT), where the goal is to recover a sparse binary vector from aggregate subset-sum queries: each query selects a subset of indices and returns the sum of those entries. Information-theoretic results suggest that adaptivity could yield up to a twofold reduction in the total number of required queries, yet no algorithm has surpassed the non-adaptive bound, leaving its practical benefit an open question. In this paper, we reduce the QGT problem to an integer-vector recovery task whose dimension scales with the sparsity of the original problem rather than its full ambient size. We then formulate this reduced recovery task as an offline reinforcement learning problem and employ Decision Transformers to solve it adaptively. By combining these two steps, we obtain an effective end-to-end method for solving the QGT problem. Our experiments show that, for the first time in the literature, our adaptive algorithm reduces the average number of queries below the well-known non-adaptive information-theoretic bound, demonstrating that adaptivity can indeed reduce the number of queries.</p></details> |  |

Spiking neural networks promise ultra-low-power, event-driven inference, yet no prior work has seamlessly merged spiking dynamics with return-conditioned sequence modeling. We present the Spiking Decision Transformer (SNN-DT), which embeds Leaky Integrate-and-Fire neurons into each self-attention block, trains end-to-end via surrogate gradients, and incorporates biologically inspired three-factor plasticity, phase-shifted spike-based positional encodings, and a lightweight dendritic routing module. Our implementation matches or exceeds standard Decision Transformer performance on classic control benchmarks (CartPole-v1, MountainCar-v0, Acrobot-v1, Pendulum-v1) while emitting fewer than ten spikes per decision, an energy proxy suggesting over four orders-of-magnitude reduction in per inference energy. By marrying sequence modeling with neuromorphic efficiency, SNN-DT opens a pathway toward real-time, low-power control on embedded and wearable devices.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint (31 pages, 19 images, 7 tables)</p></details> |

This limitation makes it difficult for agents to generalize and achieve high performance, as they must learn primarily from imperfect or inconsistent trajectories. A central challenge is therefore how to best leverage scarce expert demonstrations alongside abundant but lower-quality data. We demonstrate that incorporating even a tiny amount of expert experience can substantially improve RL agent performance. We introduce Re:Frame (Retrieving Experience From Associative Memory), a plug-in module that augments a standard offline RL policy (e.g., Decision Transformer) with a small external Associative Memory Buffer (AMB) populated by expert trajectories drawn from a separate dataset. During training on low-quality data, the policy learns to retrieve expert data from the Associative Memory Buffer (AMB) via content-based associations and integrate them into decision-making; the same AMB is queried at evaluation. This requires no environment interaction and no modifications to the backbone architecture. On D4RL MuJoCo tasks, using as few as 60 expert trajectories (0.1% of a 6000-trajectory dataset), Re:Frame consistently improves over a strong Decision Transformer baseline in three of four settings, with gains up to +10.7 normalized points. These results show that Re:Frame offers a simple and data-efficient way to inject scarce expert knowledge and substantially improve offline RL from low-quality datasets.</p></details> | 11 pages, 3 figures |

This highlights the importance of efficient path planning strategies. However, most recent navigation models focus solely on deterministic or time-dependent networks, while overlooking the correlations and the stochastic nature of traffic flows. In this work, we address the reliable shortest path problem within stochastic transportation networks under certain dependencies. We propose a path planning solution that integrates the decision Transformer with the Generalized Policy Gradient (GPG) framework. Based on the decision Transformer's capability to model long-term dependencies, our proposed solution improves the accuracy and stability of path decisions. Experimental results on the Sioux Falls Network (SFN) demonstrate that our approach outperforms previous baselines in terms of on-time arrival probability, providing more accurate path planning solutions.</p></details> |  |
| **[Toward Deployable Multi-Robot Collaboration via a Symbolically-Guided Decision Transformer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13877v1)** | 2025-08-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement learning (RL) has demonstrated great potential in robotic operations. However, its data-intensive nature and reliance on the Markov Decision Process (MDP) assumption limit its practical deployment in real-world scenarios involving complex dynamics and long-term temporal dependencies, such as multi-robot manipulation. Decision Transformers (DTs) have emerged as a promising offline alternative by leveraging causal transformers for sequence modeling in RL tasks. However, their applications to multi-robot manipulations still remain underexplored. To address this gap, we propose a novel framework, Symbolically-Guided Decision Transformer (SGDT), which integrates a neuro-symbolic mechanism with a causal transformer to enable deployable multi-robot collaboration. In the proposed SGDT framework, a neuro-symbolic planner generates a high-level task-oriented plan composed of symbolic subgoals. Guided by these subgoals, a goal-conditioned decision transformer (GCDT) performs low-level sequential decision-making for multi-robot manipulation. This hierarchical architecture enables structured, interpretable, and generalizable decision making in complex multi-robot collaboration tasks. We evaluate the performance of SGDT across a range of task scenarios, including zero-shot and few-shot scenarios. To our knowledge, this is the first work to explore DT-based technology for multi-robot manipulation.</p></details> |  |
| **[TADT-CSA: Temporal Advantage Decision Transformer with Contrastive State Abstraction for Generative Recommendation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20327v2)** | 2025-08-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the rapid advancement of Transformer-based Large Language Models (LLMs), generative recommendation has shown great potential in enhancing both the accuracy and semantic understanding of modern recommender systems. Compared to LLMs, the Decision Transformer (DT) is a lightweight generative model applied to sequential recommendation tasks. However, DT faces challenges in trajectory stitching, often producing suboptimal trajectories. Moreover, due to the high dimensionality of user states and the vast state space inherent in recommendation scenarios, DT can incur significant computational costs and struggle to learn effective state representations. To overcome these issues, we propose a novel Temporal Advantage Decision Transformer with Contrastive State Abstraction (TADT-CSA) model. Specifically, we combine the conventional Return-To-Go (RTG) signal with a novel temporal advantage (TA) signal that encourages the model to capture both long-term returns and their sequential trend. Furthermore, we integrate a contrastive state abstraction module into the DT framework to learn more effective and expressive state representations. Within this module, we introduce a TA-conditioned State Vector Quantization (TAC-SVQ) strategy, where the TA score guides the state codebooks to incorporate contextual token information. Additionally, a reward prediction network and a contrastive transition prediction (CTP) network are employed to ensure the state codebook preserves both the reward information of the current state and the transition information between adjacent states. Empirical results on both public datasets and an online recommendation system demonstrate the effectiveness of the TADT-CSA model and its superiority over baseline methods.</p></details> |  |

While prevalent in NLP, this capability has recently also been observed in Reinforcement Learning (RL) settings. Prior in-context RL methods, however, require entire episodes in the agent's context. Given that complex environments typically lead to long episodes with sparse rewards, these methods are constrained to simple environments with short episodes. To address these challenges, we introduce Retrieval-Augmented Decision Transformer (RA-DT). RA-DT employs an external memory mechanism to store past experiences from which it retrieves only sub-trajectories relevant for the current situation. The retrieval component in RA-DT does not require training and can be entirely domain-agnostic. We evaluate the capabilities of RA-DT on grid-world environments, robotics simulations, and procedurally-generated video games. On grid-worlds, RA-DT outperforms baselines, while using only a fraction of their context length. Furthermore, we illuminate the limitations of current in-context RL methods on complex environments and discuss future directions. To facilitate future research, we release datasets for four of the considered environments.</p></details> |  |

Regrettably, existing coupon distribution strategies fall far short of effectively leveraging the complex sequential interactions between platforms and users. This critical oversight, despite the abundance of e-commerce log data, has precipitated a performance plateau. In this paper, we focus on the scene that the platforms make sequential coupon distribution decision multiple times for various users, with each user interacting with the platform repeatedly. Based on this marketing scenario, we propose a novel marketing framework, named Aligned Decision Transformer for Coupons (ADT4Coupons), to directly devise coupon distribution policy for long-term revenue boosting. ADT4Coupons enables optimized online decision-making in a variety of real-world marketing scenarios. It achieves this by seamlessly integrating three key characteristics, general scenarios, sequential modeling with more comprehensive historical data, and efficient iterative updates within a unified framework. Furthermore, empirical results on real-world industrial dataset, alongside public and synthetic datasets demonstrate the superiority of our framework.</p></details> |  |

We present a new reinforcement learning (RL) framework based on the Soft Actor-Critic (SAC) algorithm to optimize engine control in series HEVs. We reformulate the control task as a sequential decision-making problem and enhance SAC by incorporating Gated Recurrent Units (GRUs) and Decision Transformers (DTs) into both actor and critic networks to capture temporal dependencies and improve planning over time. To evaluate robustness and generalization, we train the models under diverse initial battery states, drive cycle durations, power demands, and input sequence lengths. Experiments show that the SAC agent with a DT-based actor and GRU-based critic was within 1.8% of Dynamic Programming (DP) in fuel savings on the Highway Fuel Economy Test (HFET) cycle, while the SAC agent with GRUs in both actor and critic networks, and FFN actor-critic agent were within 3.16% and 3.43%, respectively.

| **[Decision Transformer-Based Drone Trajectory Planning with Dynamic Safety-Efficiency Trade-Offs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21506v2)** | 2025-07-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A drone trajectory planner should be able to dynamically adjust the safety-efficiency trade-off according to varying mission requirements in unknown environments. Although traditional polynomial-based planners offer computational efficiency and smooth trajectory generation, they require expert knowledge to tune multiple parameters to adjust this trade-off. Moreover, even with careful tuning, the resulting adjustment may fail to achieve the desired trade-off. Similarly, although reinforcement learning-based planners are adaptable in unknown environments, they do not explicitly address the safety-efficiency trade-off. To overcome this limitation, we introduce a Decision Transformer-based trajectory planner that leverages a single parameter, Return-to-Go (RTG), as a \emph{temperature parameter} to dynamically adjust the safety-efficiency trade-off. In our framework, since RTG intuitively measures the safety and efficiency of a trajectory, RTG tuning does not require expert knowledge. We validate our approach using Gazebo simulations in both structured grid and unstructured random environments. The experimental results demonstrate that our planner can dynamically adjust the safety-efficiency trade-off by simply tuning the RTG parameter. Furthermore, our planner outperforms existing baseline methods across various RTG settings, generating safer trajectories when tuned for safety and more efficient trajectories when tuned for efficiency. Real-world experiments further confirm the reliability and practicality of our proposed planner.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS) 2025.

The Prompting Decision Transformer (PDT) enables large-scale, multi-task offline Reinforcement Learning (RL) pre-training by leveraging stochastic trajectory prompts to identify the target task. However, these prompts are sampled uniformly from expert demonstrations, overlooking a critical limitation: not all prompts are equally informative for differentiating between tasks. This limits generalization and adaptation, especially in low-data or open-world settings where sample efficiency is crucial. To address this issue, we propose a lightweight, inference-time, bandit-based prompt-tuning framework. The bandit explores and optimizes trajectory prompt selection to enhance task performance, while avoiding costly fine-tuning of the transformer backbone. Our experiments indicate not only clear performance gains due to bandit-based prompt-tuning, but also better sample complexity, scalability, and prompt space exploration compared to prompt-tuning baselines. These results highlights the importance of adaptive prompt selection mechanisms for efficient generalization in offline multi-task RL.</p></details> |  |
| **[Should We Ever Prefer Decision Transformer for Offline Reinforcement Learning?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10174v1)** | 2025-07-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, extensive work has explored the application of the Transformer architecture to reinforcement learning problems. Among these, Decision Transformer (DT) has gained particular attention in the context of offline reinforcement learning due to its ability to frame return-conditioned policy learning as a sequence modeling task. Most recently, Bhargava et al. (2024) provided a systematic comparison of DT with more conventional MLP-based offline RL algorithms, including Behavior Cloning (BC) and Conservative Q-Learning (CQL), and claimed that DT exhibits superior performance in sparse-reward and low-quality data settings. In this paper, through experimentation on robotic manipulation tasks (Robomimic) and locomotion benchmarks (D4RL), we show that MLP-based Filtered Behavior Cloning (FBC) achieves competitive or superior performance compared to DT in sparse-reward environments. FBC simply filters out low-performing trajectories from the dataset and then performs ordinary behavior cloning on the filtered dataset. FBC is not only very straightforward, but it also requires less training data and is computationally more efficient. The results therefore suggest that DT is not preferable for sparse-reward environments. From prior work, arguably, DT is also not preferable for dense-reward environments. Thus, we pose the question: Is DT ever preferable?</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by RLBrew: Ingredients for Developing Generalist Agents workshop (RLC 2025)</p></details> |
| **[Direct Regret Optimization in Bayesian Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06529v1)** | 2025-07-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Bayesian optimization (BO) is a powerful paradigm for optimizing expensive black-box functions. Traditional BO methods typically rely on separate hand-crafted acquisition functions and surrogate models for the underlying function, and often operate in a myopic manner. In this paper, we propose a novel direct regret optimization approach that jointly learns the optimal model and non-myopic acquisition by distilling from a set of candidate models and acquisitions, and explicitly targets minimizing the multi-step regret. Our framework leverages an ensemble of Gaussian Processes (GPs) with varying hyperparameters to generate simulated BO trajectories, each guided by an acquisition function chosen from a pool of conventional choices, until a Bayesian early stop criterion is met. These simulated trajectories, capturing multi-step exploration strategies, are used to train an end-to-end decision transformer that directly learns to select next query points aimed at improving the ultimate objective. We further adopt a dense training--sparse learning paradigm: The decision transformer is trained offline with abundant simulated data sampled from ensemble GPs and acquisitions, while a limited number of real evaluations refine the GPs online. Experimental results on synthetic and real-world benchmarks suggest that our method consistently outperforms BO baselines, achieving lower simple regret and demonstrating more robust exploration in high-dimensional or noisy settings.</p></details> |  |
| **[Offline Reinforcement Learning for Mobility Robustness Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22793v1)** | 2025-06-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this work we revisit the Mobility Robustness Optimisation (MRO) algorithm and study the possibility of learning the optimal Cell Individual Offset tuning using offline Reinforcement Learning. Such methods make use of collected offline datasets to learn the optimal policy, without further exploration. We adapt and apply a sequence-based method called Decision Transformers as well as a value-based method called Conservative Q-Learning to learn the optimal policy for the same target reward as the vanilla rule-based MRO. The same input features related to failures, ping-pongs, and other handover issues are used. Evaluation for realistic New Radio networks with 3500 MHz carrier frequency on a traffic mix including diverse user service types and a specific tunable cell-pair shows that offline-RL methods outperform rule-based MRO, offering up to 7% improvement. Furthermore, offline-RL can be trained for diverse objective functions using the same available dataset, thus offering operational flexibility compared to rule-based methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, double column, 4 figures, 6 tables, conference submission</p></details> |
| **[Optimal Return-to-Go Guided Decision Transformer for Auto-Bidding in Advertisement](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21956v1)** | 2025-06-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the realm of online advertising, advertisers partake in ad auctions to obtain advertising slots, frequently taking advantage of auto-bidding tools provided by demand-side platforms. To improve the automation of these bidding systems, we adopt generative models, namely the Decision Transformer (DT), to tackle the difficulties inherent in automated bidding. Applying the Decision Transformer to the auto-bidding task enables a unified approach to sequential modeling, which efficiently overcomes short-sightedness by capturing long-term dependencies between past bidding actions and user behavior. Nevertheless, conventional DT has certain drawbacks: (1) DT necessitates a preset return-to-go (RTG) value before generating actions, which is not inherently produced; (2) The policy learned by DT is restricted by its training data, which is consists of mixed-quality trajectories. To address these challenges, we introduce the R* Decision Transformer (R* DT), developed in a three-step process: (1) R DT: Similar to traditional DT, R DT stores actions based on state and RTG value, as well as memorizing the RTG for a given state using the training set; (2) R^ DT: We forecast the highest value (within the training set) of RTG for a given state, deriving a suboptimal policy based on the current state and the forecasted supreme RTG value; (3) R* DT: Based on R^ DT, we generate trajectories and select those with high rewards (using a simulator) to augment our training dataset. This data enhancement has been shown to improve the RTG of trajectories in the training data and gradually leads the suboptimal policy towards optimality. Comprehensive tests on a publicly available bidding dataset validate the R* DT's efficacy and highlight its superiority when dealing with mixed-quality trajectories.</p></details> |  |
| **[Return-Aligned Decision Transformer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.03923v6)** | 2025-06-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Traditional approaches in offline reinforcement learning aim to learn the optimal policy that maximizes the cumulative reward, also known as return. It is increasingly important to adjust the performance of AI agents to meet human requirements, for example, in applications like video games and education tools. Decision Transformer (DT) optimizes a policy that generates actions conditioned on the target return through supervised learning and includes a mechanism to control the agent's performance using the target return. However, the action generation is hardly influenced by the target return because DT's self-attention allocates scarce attention scores to the return tokens. In this paper, we propose Return-Aligned Decision Transformer (RADT), designed to more effectively align the actual return with the target return. RADT leverages features extracted by paying attention solely to the return, enabling action generation to consistently depend on the target return. Extensive experiments show that RADT significantly reduces the discrepancies between the actual return and the target return compared to DT-based methods. Our code is available at https://github.com/CyberAgentAILab/radt</p></details> |  |

These PLMs perform well in RL tasks, raising an intriguing question: what kind of knowledge from PLMs has been transferred to RL to achieve such good results? This work first dives into this problem by analyzing each head quantitatively and points out Markov head, a crucial component that exists in the attention heads of PLMs. It leads to extreme attention on the last-input token and performs well only in short-term environments. Furthermore, we prove that this extreme attention cannot be changed by re-training embedding layer or fine-tuning. Inspired by our analysis, we propose a general method GPT2-DTMA, which equips a pretrained DT with Mixture of Attention (MoA), to accommodate diverse attention requirements during fine-tuning. Extensive experiments corroborate our theorems and demonstrate the effectiveness of GPT2-DTMA: it achieves comparable performance in short-term environments while significantly narrowing the performance gap in long-term environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>The f...</summary><p>The first two authors contributed equally.

| **[Mastering Massive Multi-Task Reinforcement Learning via Mixture-of-Expert Decision Transformer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24378v1)** | 2025-05-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite recent advancements in offline multi-task reinforcement learning (MTRL) have harnessed the powerful capabilities of the Transformer architecture, most approaches focus on a limited number of tasks, with scaling to extremely massive tasks remaining a formidable challenge. In this paper, we first revisit the key impact of task numbers on current MTRL method, and further reveal that naively expanding the parameters proves insufficient to counteract the performance degradation as the number of tasks escalates. Building upon these insights, we propose M3DT, a novel mixture-of-experts (MoE) framework that tackles task scalability by further unlocking the model's parameter scalability. Specifically, we enhance both the architecture and the optimization of the agent, where we strengthen the Decision Transformer (DT) backbone with MoE to reduce task load on parameter subsets, and introduce a three-stage training mechanism to facilitate efficient training with optimal performance. Experimental results show that, by increasing the number of experts, M3DT not only consistently enhances its performance as model expansion on the fixed task numbers, but also exhibits remarkable task scalability, successfully extending to 160 tasks with superior performance.</p></details> | ICML 2025 |
| **[Hierarchical Neuro-Symbolic Decision Transformer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07148v3)** | 2025-05-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present a hierarchical neuro-symbolic control framework that tightly couples a classical symbolic planner with a transformer-based policy to address long-horizon decision-making under uncertainty. At the high level, the planner assembles an interpretable sequence of operators that guarantees logical coherence with task constraints, while at the low level each operator is rendered as a sub-goal token that conditions a decision transformer to generate fine-grained actions directly from raw observations. This bidirectional interface preserves the combinatorial efficiency and explainability of symbolic reasoning without sacrificing the adaptability of deep sequence models, and it permits a principled analysis that tracks how approximation errors from both planning and execution accumulate across the hierarchy. Empirical studies in stochastic grid-world domains demonstrate that the proposed method consistently surpasses purely symbolic, purely neural and existing hierarchical baselines in both success and efficiency, highlighting its robustness for sequential tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Attention-Enhanced Prompt Decision Transformers for UAV-Assisted Communications with AoI](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22170v1)** | 2025-05-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Decision Transformer (DT) has recently demonstrated strong generalizability in dynamic resource allocation within unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) networks, compared to conventional deep reinforcement learning (DRL). However, its performance is hindered due to zero-padding for varying state dimensions, inability to manage long-term energy constraint, and challenges in acquiring expert samples for few-shot fine-tuning in new scenarios. To overcome these limitations, we propose an attention-enhanced prompt Decision Transformer (APDT) framework to optimize trajectory planning and user scheduling, aiming to minimize the average age of information (AoI) under long-term energy constraint in UAV-assisted Internet of Things (IoT) networks. Specifically, we enhance the convenional DT framework by incorporating an attention mechanism to accommodate varying numbers of terrestrial users, introducing a prompt mechanism based on short trajectory demonstrations for rapid adaptation to new scenarios, and designing a token-assisted method to address the UAV's long-term energy constraint. The APDT framework is first pre-trained on offline datasets and then efficiently generalized to new scenarios. Simulations demonstrate that APDT achieves twice faster in terms of convergence rate and reduces average AoI by $8\%$ compared to conventional DT.</p></details> |  |
| **[Prompting Decision Transformers for Zero-Shot Reach-Avoid Policies](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19337v2)** | 2025-05-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Offline goal-conditioned reinforcement learning methods have shown promise for reach-avoid tasks, where an agent must reach a target state while avoiding undesirable regions of the state space. Existing approaches typically encode avoid-region information into an augmented state space and cost function, which prevents flexible, dynamic specification of novel avoid-region information at evaluation time. They also rely heavily on well-designed reward and cost functions, limiting scalability to complex or poorly structured environments. We introduce RADT, a decision transformer model for offline, reward-free, goal-conditioned, avoid region-conditioned RL. RADT encodes goals and avoid regions directly as prompt tokens, allowing any number of avoid regions of arbitrary size to be specified at evaluation time. Using only suboptimal offline trajectories from a random policy, RADT learns reach-avoid behavior through a novel combination of goal and avoid-region hindsight relabeling. We benchmark RADT against 3 existing offline goal-conditioned RL models across 11 tasks, environments, and experimental settings. RADT generalizes in a zero-shot manner to out-of-distribution avoid region sizes and counts, outperforming baselines that require retraining. In one such zero-shot setting, RADT achieves 35.7% improvement in normalized cost over the best retrained baseline while maintaining high goal-reaching success. We apply RADT to cell reprogramming in biology, where it reduces visits to undesirable intermediate gene expression states during trajectories to desired target states, despite stochastic transitions and discrete, structured state dynamics.</p></details> |  |

In the considered system, mobile users are expected to interact with a DT model maintained on a DT server that is deployed on a base station, via effective uplink and downlink channels assisted by an RIS. Our goal is to maximize the sum of all mobile users' joint subjective and objective QoE in DT interactions across various DT scenes, by jointly optimizing phase shift matrix, receive/transmit beamforming matrix, rendering resolution configuration and computing resource allocation. While solving this problem is challenging mainly due to the uncertain evolution of the DT model, which leads to multiple scene-specific problems, and require us to constantly re-solve each of them whenever DT model evolves. To this end, leveraging the dynamic optimization capabilities of decision transformers and the generalization strengths of generative artificial intelligence (GAI), we propose a novel GAI-aided approach, called the prompt-guided decision transformer integrated with zero-forcing optimization (PG-ZFO). Simulations are conducted to evaluate the proposed PG-ZFO, demonstrating its effectiveness and superiority over counterparts.</p></details> |  |
| **[Beyond the Known: Decision Making with Counterfactual Reasoning Decision Transformer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09114v1)** | 2025-05-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Decision Transformers (DT) play a crucial role in modern reinforcement learning, leveraging offline datasets to achieve impressive results across various domains. However, DT requires high-quality, comprehensive data to perform optimally. In real-world applications, the lack of training data and the scarcity of optimal behaviours make training on offline datasets challenging, as suboptimal data can hinder performance. To address this, we propose the Counterfactual Reasoning Decision Transformer (CRDT), a novel framework inspired by counterfactual reasoning. CRDT enhances DT ability to reason beyond known data by generating and utilizing counterfactual experiences, enabling improved decision-making in unseen scenarios. Experiments across Atari and D4RL benchmarks, including scenarios with limited data and altered dynamics, demonstrate that CRDT outperforms conventional DT approaches. Additionally, reasoning counterfactually allows the DT agent to obtain stitching abilities, combining suboptimal trajectories, without architectural modifications. These results highlight the potential of counterfactual reasoning to enhance reinforcement learning agents' performance and generalization capabilities.</p></details> |  |

These models generalize effectively, and have proven to be very successful in Natural Language Processing (NLP). Inspired by the generalization capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), we investigate whether the same NTP paradigm can be applied to DBMS design and optimization tasks. Adopting NTP directly for database optimization is non-trivial due to the fundamental differences between the domains. In this paper, we present a framework, termed Probe and Learn (PoLe), for applying NTP to optimize database systems. PoLe leverages Decision Transformers and hardware-generated tokens to effectively incorporate NTP into database systems. As a proof of concept, we demonstrate PoLe in the context of the index scheduling task over NUMA servers in main-memory database systems. Preliminary results for this scheduling task demonstrate that adopting NTP and PoLe can improve both performance and generalizability.</p></details> | <details><summary>To ap...</summary><p>To appear at aiDM@SIGMOD'25</p></details> |

It enables adaptive, on-demand management of the network based on the objectives of the network operators. In this paper, we propose an innovative three-step framework for intent-driven network management based on Generative AI (GenAI) algorithms. First, we fine-tune a Large Language Model (LLM) on a custom dataset using a Quantized Low-Rank Adapter (QLoRA) to enable memory-efficient intent processing within limited computational resources. A Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) module is included to support dynamic decision-making. Second, we utilize a transformer architecture for time series forecasting to predict key parameters, such as power consumption, traffic load, and packet drop rate, to facilitate intent validation proactively. Lastly, we introduce a Hierarchical Decision Transformer with Goal Awareness (HDTGA) to optimize the selection and orchestration of network applications and hence, optimize the network. Our intent guidance and processing approach improves BERTScore by 6% and the semantic similarity score by 9% compared to the base LLM model. Again, the proposed predictive intent validation approach can successfully rule out the performance-degrading intents with an average of 88% accuracy. Finally, compared to the baselines, the proposed HDTGA algorithm increases throughput at least by 19.3%, reduces delay by 48.5%, and boosts energy efficiency by 54.9%.</p></details> | <details><summary>Curre...</summary><p>Currently under review</p></details> |

Our investigation focuses on two primary approaches: Deep Transformer Q- learning Networks (DTQN) for online learning and Decision Transformers (DT) for offline reinforcement learning. DTQN leverages the sequential modelling capabilities of Transformers to enhance Q-learning in partially observable environments,while Decision Transformers repurpose sequence modelling techniques to enable offline agents to learn from past trajectories without direct interaction with the environment. We conclude that while Transformers might have performed well in Atari games, more traditional methods perform better than Transformer based method in both the settings in the VizDoom environment.</p></details> |  |
| **[Improving Sequential Recommenders through Counterfactual Augmentation of System Exposure](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13482v1)** | 2025-04-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In sequential recommendation (SR), system exposure refers to items that are exposed to the user. Typically, only a few of the exposed items would be interacted with by the user. Although SR has achieved great success in predicting future user interests, existing SR methods still fail to fully exploit system exposure data. Most methods only model items that have been interacted with, while the large volume of exposed but non-interacted items is overlooked. Even methods that consider the whole system exposure typically train the recommender using only the logged historical system exposure, without exploring unseen user interests. In this paper, we propose counterfactual augmentation over system exposure for sequential recommendation (CaseRec). To better model historical system exposure, CaseRec introduces reinforcement learning to account for different exposure rewards. CaseRec uses a decision transformer-based sequential model to take an exposure sequence as input and assigns different rewards according to the user feedback. To further explore unseen user interests, CaseRec proposes to perform counterfactual augmentation, where exposed original items are replaced with counterfactual items. Then, a transformer-based user simulator is proposed to predict the user feedback reward for the augmented items. Augmentation, together with the user simulator, constructs counterfactual exposure sequences to uncover new user interests. Finally, CaseRec jointly uses the logged exposure sequences with the counterfactual exposure sequences to train a decision transformer-based sequential model for generating recommendation. Experiments on three real-world benchmarks show the effectiveness of CaseRec. Our code is available at https://github.com/ZiqiZhao1/CaseRec.</p></details> | <details><summary>accep...</summary><p>accepted at SIGIR 2025 (Proceedings of the 48th International ACM SIGIR Conference on Research and Development in Information Retrieval)</p></details> |

Notably, the decision transformer (DT) architecture has shown promise across various domains. However, despite its initial success, DTs have underperformed on several challenging datasets in goal-conditioned RL. This limitation stems from the inefficiency of return conditioning for guiding policy learning, particularly in unstructured and suboptimal datasets, resulting in DTs failing to effectively learn temporal compositionality. Moreover, this problem might be further exacerbated in long-horizon sparse-reward tasks. To address this challenge, we propose the Predictive Coding for Decision Transformer (PCDT) framework, which leverages generalized future conditioning to enhance DT methods. PCDT utilizes an architecture that extends the DT framework, conditioned on predictive codings, enabling decision-making based on both past and future factors, thereby improving generalization. Through extensive experiments on eight datasets from the AntMaze and FrankaKitchen environments, our proposed method achieves performance on par with or surpassing existing popular value-based and transformer-based methods in offline goal-conditioned RL. Furthermore, we also evaluate our method on a goal-reaching task with a physical robot.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, IROS 2024.

For example, the Decision Transformer recasts agentic decision making as a sequence modeling problem, using a decoder-only LLM to model the distribution over the discrete action space for an Atari agent. However, when adapting LLMs to non-linguistic domains, it remains unclear if softmax over discrete bins captures the continuous structure of the tokens and the potentially complex distributions needed for high quality token generation. We introduce a neural network layer, constructed using Fourier series, which we can easily substitute for any linear layer if we want the outputs to have a more continuous structure. We perform extensive analysis on synthetic datasets, as well as on large-scale decision making and time series forecasting tasks. We also provide theoretical evidence that this layer can better learn signal from data while ignoring high-frequency noise. All of our results support the effectiveness of our proposed Fourier head in scenarios where the underlying data distribution has a natural continuous structure. For example, the Fourier head improves a Decision Transformer agent's returns across four benchmark Atari games by as much as 377%, and increases a state-of-the-art times series foundation model's forecasting performance by 3.5% across 20 benchmarks unseen during training.</p></details> | <details><summary>Camer...</summary><p>Camera ready version (ICLR 2025).

Recent advancements in transformer-based offline reinforcement learning, exemplified by the MultiGame Decision Transformer [Lee et al., 2022], have shown remarkable performance across various games or tasks. However, these approaches depend heavily on human expertise, presenting substantial challenges for practical deployment, particularly in scenarios with limited prior game-specific knowledge. In this paper, we propose an algorithm called Multi-Game Target Return Optimizer (MTRO) to autonomously determine game-specific target returns within the Multi-Game Decision Transformer framework using solely offline datasets. MTRO addresses the existing limitations by automating the target return configuration process, leveraging environmental reward information extracted from offline datasets. Notably, MTRO does not require additional training, enabling seamless integration into existing Multi-Game Decision Transformer architectures. Our experimental evaluations on Atari games demonstrate that MTRO enhances the performance of RL policies across a wide array of games, underscoring its potential to advance the field of autonomous agent development.</p></details> | 10 pages |

However, real-world data collected from sensors or humans often contains noise and errors, posing a significant challenge for existing offline RL methods, particularly when the real-world data is limited. Our study reveals that prior research focusing on adapting predominant offline RL methods based on temporal difference learning still falls short under data corruption when the dataset is limited. In contrast, we discover that vanilla sequence modeling methods, such as Decision Transformer, exhibit robustness against data corruption, even without specialized modifications. To unlock the full potential of sequence modeling, we propose Robust Decision Rransformer (RDT) by incorporating three simple yet effective robust techniques: embedding dropout to improve the model's robustness against erroneous inputs, Gaussian weighted learning to mitigate the effects of corrupted labels, and iterative data correction to eliminate corrupted data from the source. Extensive experiments on MuJoCo, Kitchen, and Adroit tasks demonstrate RDT's superior performance under various data corruption scenarios compared to prior methods. Furthermore, RDT exhibits remarkable robustness in a more challenging setting that combines training-time data corruption with test-time observation perturbations. These results highlight the potential of sequence modeling for learning from noisy or corrupted offline datasets, thereby promoting the reliable application of offline RL in real-world scenarios.

Transformers, a standard choice for modeling time-series data, are gaining popularity in offline RL. In this context, Beam Search (BS), an approximate inference algorithm, is the go-to decoding method. Offline RL eliminates the need for costly or risky online data collection. However, the restricted dataset induces uncertainty as the agent may encounter unfamiliar sequences of states and actions during execution that were not covered in the training data. In this context, BS lacks two important properties essential for offline RL: It does not account for the aforementioned uncertainty, and its greedy left-right search approach often results in sequences with minimal variations, failing to explore potentially better alternatives. To address these limitations, we propose Portfolio Beam Search (PBS), a simple-yet-effective alternative to BS that balances exploration and exploitation within a Transformer model during decoding. We draw inspiration from financial economics and apply these principles to develop an uncertainty-aware diversification mechanism, which we integrate into a sequential decoding algorithm at inference time. We empirically demonstrate the effectiveness of PBS on the D4RL locomotion benchmark, where it achieves higher returns and significantly reduces outcome variability.</p></details> |  |
| **[Decision Transformer for Enhancing Neural Local Search on the Job Shop Scheduling Problem](https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02697v2)** | 2025-02-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The job shop scheduling problem (JSSP) and its solution algorithms have been of enduring interest in both academia and industry for decades. In recent years, machine learning (ML) is playing an increasingly important role in advancing existing and building new heuristic solutions for the JSSP, aiming to find better solutions in shorter computation times. In this paper we build on top of a state-of-the-art deep reinforcement learning (DRL) agent, called Neural Local Search (NLS), which can efficiently and effectively control a large local neighborhood search on the JSSP. In particular, we develop a method for training the decision transformer (DT) algorithm on search trajectories taken by a trained NLS agent to further improve upon the learned decision-making sequences. Our experiments show that the DT successfully learns local search strategies that are different and, in many cases, more effective than those of the NLS agent itself. In terms of the tradeoff between solution quality and acceptable computational time needed for the search, the DT is particularly superior in application scenarios where longer computational times are acceptable. In this case, it makes up for the longer inference times required per search step, which are caused by the larger neural network architecture, through better quality decisions per step. Thereby, the DT achieves state-of-the-art results for solving the JSSP with ML-enhanced search.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we propose temporal logic Specification-conditioned Decision Transformer (SDT), a novel framework that harnesses the expressive power of signal temporal logic (STL) to specify complex temporal rules that an agent should follow and the sequential modeling capability of Decision Transformer (DT). Empirical evaluations on the DSRL benchmarks demonstrate the better capacity of SDT in learning safe and high-reward policies compared with existing approaches.

Current recommendation strategies grapple with two significant hurdles. Firstly, the future impacts of recommendation decisions remain obscured, rendering it impractical to evaluate them through direct optimization of immediate metrics. Secondly, conflicts often emerge between multiple objectives, like enhancing accuracy versus exploring diverse recommendations. Existing strategies, trapped in a "training, evaluation, and retraining" loop, grow more labor-intensive as objectives evolve. To address these challenges, we introduce a future-conditioned strategy for multi-objective controllable recommendations, allowing for the direct specification of future objectives and empowering the model to generate item sequences that align with these goals autoregressively. We present the Multi-Objective Controllable Decision Transformer (MocDT), an offline Reinforcement Learning (RL) model capable of autonomously learning the mapping from multiple objectives to item sequences, leveraging extensive offline data. Consequently, it can produce recommendations tailored to any specified objectives during the inference stage. Our empirical findings emphasize the controllable recommendation strategy's ability to produce item sequences according to different objectives while maintaining performance that is competitive with current recommendation strategies across various objectives.</p></details> |  |

However, decision models based on Mamba, a state-of-the-art SSM, failed to achieve superior performance compared to these enhanced Decision Transformers. We hypothesize that this limitation arises from information loss during the selective scanning phase. To address this, we propose the Decision MetaMamba (DMM), which augments Mamba with a token mixer in its input layer. This mixer explicitly accounts for the multimodal nature of offline RL inputs, comprising state, action, and return-to-go. The DMM demonstrates improved performance while significantly reducing parameter count compared to prior models. Notably, similar performance gains were achieved using a simple linear token mixer, emphasizing the importance of preserving information from proximate time steps rather than the specific design of the token mixer itself.

| **[In-Dataset Trajectory Return Regularization for Offline Preference-based Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09104v2)** | 2024-12-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Offline preference-based reinforcement learning (PbRL) typically operates in two phases: first, use human preferences to learn a reward model and annotate rewards for a reward-free offline dataset; second, learn a policy by optimizing the learned reward via offline RL. However, accurately modeling step-wise rewards from trajectory-level preference feedback presents inherent challenges. The reward bias introduced, particularly the overestimation of predicted rewards, leads to optimistic trajectory stitching, which undermines the pessimism mechanism critical to the offline RL phase. To address this challenge, we propose In-Dataset Trajectory Return Regularization (DTR) for offline PbRL, which leverages conditional sequence modeling to mitigate the risk of learning inaccurate trajectory stitching under reward bias. Specifically, DTR employs Decision Transformer and TD-Learning to strike a balance between maintaining fidelity to the behavior policy with high in-dataset trajectory returns and selecting optimal actions based on high reward labels. Additionally, we introduce an ensemble normalization technique that effectively integrates multiple reward models, balancing the tradeoff between reward differentiation and accuracy. Empirical evaluations on various benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of DTR over other state-of-the-art baselines.</p></details> | <details><summary>20 pa...</summary><p>20 pages, Proceedings of the 39th AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence (AAAI-25)</p></details> |

Current approaches typically require long trajectory sequences to model the environment in offline RL settings. However, these models tend to over-rely on memorizing long-term representations, which impairs their ability to effectively attribute importance to trajectories and learned representations based on task-specific relevance. In this work, we introduce AdaCred, a novel approach that represents trajectories as causal graphs built from short-term action-reward-state sequences. Our model adaptively learns control policy by crediting and pruning low-importance representations, retaining only those most relevant for the downstream task. Our experiments demonstrate that AdaCred-based policies require shorter trajectory sequences and consistently outperform conventional methods in both offline reinforcement learning and imitation learning environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to 24th International Conference on Autonomous Agents and Multiagent Systems (AAMAS 2025)</p></details> |
| **[Unleashing the Power of Pre-trained Language Models for Offline Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.20587v5)** | 2024-12-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Offline reinforcement learning (RL) aims to find a near-optimal policy using pre-collected datasets. In real-world scenarios, data collection could be costly and risky; therefore, offline RL becomes particularly challenging when the in-domain data is limited. Given recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) and their few-shot learning prowess, this paper introduces $\textbf{La}$nguage Models for $\textbf{Mo}$tion Control ($\textbf{LaMo}$), a general framework based on Decision Transformers to effectively use pre-trained Language Models (LMs) for offline RL. Our framework highlights four crucial components: (1) Initializing Decision Transformers with sequentially pre-trained LMs, (2) employing the LoRA fine-tuning method, in contrast to full-weight fine-tuning, to combine the pre-trained knowledge from LMs and in-domain knowledge effectively, (3) using the non-linear MLP transformation instead of linear projections, to generate embeddings, and (4) integrating an auxiliary language prediction loss during fine-tuning to stabilize the LMs and retain their original abilities on languages. Empirical results indicate $\textbf{LaMo}$ achieves excellent performance in sparse-reward tasks and closes the gap between value-based offline RL methods and decision transformers in dense-reward tasks. In particular, our method demonstrates superior performance in scenarios with limited data samples.</p></details> | Format adjustment |

These attacks aim to manipulate the victim into specific behaviors that align with the attacker's objectives, often bypassing traditional reward-based defenses. Prior methods have primarily focused on reducing cumulative rewards; however, rewards are typically too generic to capture complex safety requirements effectively. As a result, focusing solely on reward reduction can lead to suboptimal attack strategies, particularly in safety-critical scenarios where more precise behavior manipulation is needed. To address these challenges, we propose RAT, a method designed for universal, targeted behavior attacks. RAT trains an intention policy that is explicitly aligned with human preferences, serving as a precise behavioral target for the adversary. Concurrently, an adversary manipulates the victim's policy to follow this target behavior. To enhance the effectiveness of these attacks, RAT dynamically adjusts the state occupancy measure within the replay buffer, allowing for more controlled and effective behavior manipulation. Our empirical results on robotic simulation tasks demonstrate that RAT outperforms existing adversarial attack algorithms in inducing specific behaviors. Additionally, RAT shows promise in improving agent robustness, leading to more resilient policies. We further validate RAT by guiding Decision Transformer agents to adopt behaviors aligned with human preferences in various MuJoCo tasks, demonstrating its effectiveness across diverse tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by AAAI 2025</p></details> |
| **[Hierarchical Prompt Decision Transformer: Improving Few-Shot Policy Generalization with Global and Adaptive Guidance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00979v2)** | 2024-12-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Decision transformers recast reinforcement learning as a conditional sequence generation problem, offering a simple but effective alternative to traditional value or policy-based methods. A recent key development in this area is the integration of prompting in decision transformers to facilitate few-shot policy generalization. However, current methods mainly use static prompt segments to guide rollouts, limiting their ability to provide context-specific guidance. Addressing this, we introduce a hierarchical prompting approach enabled by retrieval augmentation. Our method learns two layers of soft tokens as guiding prompts: (1) global tokens encapsulating task-level information about trajectories, and (2) adaptive tokens that deliver focused, timestep-specific instructions. The adaptive tokens are dynamically retrieved from a curated set of demonstration segments, ensuring context-aware guidance. Experiments across seven benchmark tasks in the MuJoCo and MetaWorld environments demonstrate the proposed approach consistently outperforms all baseline methods, suggesting that hierarchical prompting for decision transformers is an effective strategy to enable few-shot policy generalization.</p></details> |  |
| **[Decision Transformer vs. Decision Mamba: Analysing the Complexity of Sequential Decision Making in Atari Games](https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00725v1)** | 2024-12-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This work analyses the disparity in performance between Decision Transformer (DT) and Decision Mamba (DM) in sequence modelling reinforcement learning tasks for different Atari games. The study first observed that DM generally outperformed DT in the games Breakout and Qbert, while DT performed better in more complicated games, such as Hero and Kung Fu Master. To understand these differences, we expanded the number of games to 12 and performed a comprehensive analysis of game characteristics, including action space complexity, visual complexity, average trajectory length, and average steps to the first non-zero reward. In order to further analyse the key factors that impact the disparity in performance between DT and DM, we employ various approaches, including quantifying visual complexity, random forest regression, correlation analysis, and action space simplification strategies. The results indicate that the performance gap between DT and DM is affected by the complex interaction of multiple factors, with the complexity of the action space and visual complexity (particularly evaluated by compression ratio) being the primary determining factors. DM performs well in environments with simple action and visual elements, while DT shows an advantage in games with higher action and visual complexity. Our findings contribute to a deeper understanding of how the game characteristics affect the performance difference in sequential modelling reinforcement learning, potentially guiding the development of future model design and applications for diverse and complex environments.</p></details> |  |
| **[Offline Reinforcement Learning and Sequence Modeling for Downlink Link Adaptation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23031v2)** | 2024-11-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Link adaptation (LA) is an essential function in modern wireless communication systems that dynamically adjusts the transmission rate of a communication link to match time- and frequency-varying radio link conditions. However, factors such as user mobility, fast fading, imperfect channel quality information, and aging of measurements make the modeling of LA challenging. To bypass the need for explicit modeling, recent research has introduced online reinforcement learning (RL) approaches as an alternative to the more commonly used rule-based algorithms. Yet, RL-based approaches face deployment challenges, as training in live networks can potentially degrade real-time performance. To address this challenge, this paper considers offline RL as a candidate to learn LA policies with minimal effects on the network operation. We propose three LA designs based on batch-constrained deep Q-learning, conservative Q-learning, and decision transformer. Our results show that offline RL algorithms can match the performance of state-of-the-art online RL methods when data is collected with a proper behavioral policy.</p></details> |  |
| **[Read to Play (R2-Play): Decision Transformer with Multimodal Game Instruction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.04154v7)** | 2024-11-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Developing a generalist agent is a longstanding objective in artificial intelligence. Previous efforts utilizing extensive offline datasets from various tasks demonstrate remarkable performance in multitasking scenarios within Reinforcement Learning. However, these works encounter challenges in extending their capabilities to new tasks. Recent approaches integrate textual guidance or visual trajectory into decision networks to provide task-specific contextual cues, representing a promising direction. However, it is observed that relying solely on textual guidance or visual trajectory is insufficient for accurately conveying the contextual information of tasks. This paper explores enhanced forms of task guidance for agents, enabling them to comprehend gameplay instructions, thereby facilitating a "read-to-play" capability. Drawing inspiration from the success of multimodal instruction tuning in visual tasks, we treat the visual-based RL task as a long-horizon vision task and construct a set of multimodal game instructions to incorporate instruction tuning into a decision transformer. Experimental results demonstrate that incorporating multimodal game instructions significantly enhances the decision transformer's multitasking and generalization capabilities.</p></details> |  |
| **[Enhancing Decision Transformer with Diffusion-Based Trajectory Branch Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11327v1)** | 2024-11-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Decision Transformer (DT) can learn effective policy from offline datasets by converting the offline reinforcement learning (RL) into a supervised sequence modeling task, where the trajectory elements are generated auto-regressively conditioned on the return-to-go (RTG).However, the sequence modeling learning approach tends to learn policies that converge on the sub-optimal trajectories within the dataset, for lack of bridging data to move to better trajectories, even if the condition is set to the highest RTG.To address this issue, we introduce Diffusion-Based Trajectory Branch Generation (BG), which expands the trajectories of the dataset with branches generated by a diffusion model.The trajectory branch is generated based on the segment of the trajectory within the dataset, and leads to trajectories with higher returns.We concatenate the generated branch with the trajectory segment as an expansion of the trajectory.After expanding, DT has more opportunities to learn policies to move to better trajectories, preventing it from converging to the sub-optimal trajectories.Empirically, after processing with BG, DT outperforms state-of-the-art sequence modeling methods on D4RL benchmark, demonstrating the effectiveness of adding branches to the dataset without further modifications.</p></details> |  |
| **[P-MOSS: Learned Scheduling For Indexes Over NUMA Servers Using Low-Level Hardware Statistics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02933v1)** | 2024-11-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Ever since the Dennard scaling broke down in the early 2000s and the frequency of the CPU stalled, vendors have started to increase the core count in each CPU chip at the expense of introducing heterogeneity, thus ushering the era of NUMA processors. Since then, the heterogeneity in the design space of hardware has only increased to the point that DBMS performance may vary significantly up to an order of magnitude in modern servers. An important factor that affects performance includes the location of the logical cores where the DBMS queries are scheduled, and the locations of the data that the queries access. This paper introduces P-MOSS, a learned spatial scheduling framework that schedules query execution to certain logical cores, and places data accordingly to certain integrated memory controllers (IMC), to integrate hardware consciousness into the system. In the spirit of hardware-software synergy, P-MOSS solely guides its scheduling decision based on low-level hardware statistics collected by performance monitoring counters with the aid of a Decision Transformer. Experimental evaluation is performed in the context of the B-tree and R-tree indexes. Performance results demonstrate that P-MOSS has up to 6x improvement over traditional schedules in terms of query throughput.</p></details> |  |
| **[Multi-Agent Decision Transformers for Dynamic Dispatching in Material Handling Systems Leveraging Enterprise Big Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02584v1)** | 2024-11-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Dynamic dispatching rules that allocate resources to tasks in real-time play a critical role in ensuring efficient operations of many automated material handling systems across industries. Traditionally, the dispatching rules deployed are typically the result of manually crafted heuristics based on domain experts' knowledge. Generating these rules is time-consuming and often sub-optimal. As enterprises increasingly accumulate vast amounts of operational data, there is significant potential to leverage this big data to enhance the performance of automated systems. One promising approach is to use Decision Transformers, which can be trained on existing enterprise data to learn better dynamic dispatching rules for improving system throughput. In this work, we study the application of Decision Transformers as dynamic dispatching policies within an actual multi-agent material handling system and identify scenarios where enterprises can effectively leverage Decision Transformers on existing big data to gain business value. Our empirical results demonstrate that Decision Transformers can improve the material handling system's throughput by a considerable amount when the heuristic originally used in the enterprise data exhibits moderate performance and involves no randomness. When the original heuristic has strong performance, Decision Transformers can still improve the throughput but with a smaller improvement margin. However, when the original heuristics contain an element of randomness or when the performance of the dataset is below a certain threshold, Decision Transformers fail to outperform the original heuristic. These results highlight both the potential and limitations of Decision Transformers as dispatching policies for automated industrial material handling systems.</p></details> |  |

Recent advancements approach this through sequence modeling, leveraging the Transformer architecture's scalability and the benefits of parameter sharing to exploit task similarities. However, variations in task content and complexity pose significant challenges in policy formulation, necessitating judicious parameter sharing and management of conflicting gradients for optimal policy performance. Furthermore, identifying the optimal parameter subspace for each task often necessitates prior knowledge of the task identifier during inference, limiting applicability in real-world scenarios with variable task content and unknown current tasks. In this work, we introduce the Harmony Multi-Task Decision Transformer (HarmoDT), a novel solution designed to identify an optimal harmony subspace of parameters for each task. We formulate this as a bi-level optimization problem within a meta-learning framework, where the upper level learns masks to define the harmony subspace, while the inner level focuses on updating parameters to improve the overall performance of the unified policy. To eliminate the need for task identifiers, we further design a group-wise variant (G-HarmoDT) that clusters tasks into coherent groups based on gradient information, and utilizes a gating network to determine task identifiers during inference. Empirical evaluations across various benchmarks highlight the superiority of our approach, demonstrating its effectiveness in the multi-task context with specific improvements of 8% gain in task-provided settings, 5% in task-agnostic settings, and 10% in unseen settings.</p></details> | <details><summary>Exten...</summary><p>Extension of corresponding ICML edition arXiv:2405.18080. arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:2405.18080</p></details> |

However, current VLN frameworks often rely on static environments and optimal expert supervision, limiting their real-world applicability. To address this, we introduce Human-Aware Vision-and-Language Navigation (HA-VLN), extending traditional VLN by incorporating dynamic human activities and relaxing key assumptions. We propose the Human-Aware 3D (HA3D) simulator, which combines dynamic human activities with the Matterport3D dataset, and the Human-Aware Room-to-Room (HA-R2R) dataset, extending R2R with human activity descriptions. To tackle HA-VLN challenges, we present the Expert-Supervised Cross-Modal (VLN-CM) and Non-Expert-Supervised Decision Transformer (VLN-DT) agents, utilizing cross-modal fusion and diverse training strategies for effective navigation in dynamic human environments. A comprehensive evaluation, including metrics considering human activities, and systematic analysis of HA-VLN's unique challenges, underscores the need for further research to enhance HA-VLN agents' real-world robustness and adaptability. Ultimately, this work provides benchmarks and insights for future research on embodied AI and Sim2Real transfer, paving the way for more realistic and applicable VLN systems in human-populated environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>Spotl...</summary><p>Spotlight at NeurIPS 2024 D&B Track. 32 pages, 18 figures, Project Page: https://lpercc.github.io/HA3D_simulator/</p></details> |
| **[Adversarially Robust Decision Transformer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18414v2)** | 2024-11-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Decision Transformer (DT), as one of the representative Reinforcement Learning via Supervised Learning (RvS) methods, has achieved strong performance in offline learning tasks by leveraging the powerful Transformer architecture for sequential decision-making. However, in adversarial environments, these methods can be non-robust, since the return is dependent on the strategies of both the decision-maker and adversary. Training a probabilistic model conditioned on observed return to predict action can fail to generalize, as the trajectories that achieve a return in the dataset might have done so due to a suboptimal behavior adversary. To address this, we propose a worst-case-aware RvS algorithm, the Adversarially Robust Decision Transformer (ARDT), which learns and conditions the policy on in-sample minimax returns-to-go. ARDT aligns the target return with the worst-case return learned through minimax expectile regression, thereby enhancing robustness against powerful test-time adversaries. In experiments conducted on sequential games with full data coverage, ARDT can generate a maximin (Nash Equilibrium) strategy, the solution with the largest adversarial robustness. In large-scale sequential games and continuous adversarial RL environments with partial data coverage, ARDT demonstrates significantly superior robustness to powerful test-time adversaries and attains higher worst-case returns compared to contemporary DT methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to NeurIPS 2024</p></details> |

While improvements have been made to overcome initial shortcomings, online finetuning of decision transformers has been surprisingly under-explored. The widely adopted state-of-the-art Online Decision Transformer (ODT) still struggles when pretrained with low-reward offline data. In this paper, we theoretically analyze the online-finetuning of the decision transformer, showing that the commonly used Return-To-Go (RTG) that's far from the expected return hampers the online fine-tuning process. This problem, however, is well-addressed by the value function and advantage of standard RL algorithms. As suggested by our analysis, in our experiments, we hence find that simply adding TD3 gradients to the finetuning process of ODT effectively improves the online finetuning performance of ODT, especially if ODT is pretrained with low-reward offline data. These findings provide new directions to further improve decision transformers.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted as NeurIPS 2024 spotlight. 33 pages, 26 figures</p></details> |
| **[Return Augmented Decision Transformer for Off-Dynamics Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23450v1)** | 2024-10-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We study offline off-dynamics reinforcement learning (RL) to utilize data from an easily accessible source domain to enhance policy learning in a target domain with limited data. Our approach centers on return-conditioned supervised learning (RCSL), particularly focusing on the decision transformer (DT), which can predict actions conditioned on desired return guidance and complete trajectory history. Previous works tackle the dynamics shift problem by augmenting the reward in the trajectory from the source domain to match the optimal trajectory in the target domain. However, this strategy can not be directly applicable in RCSL owing to (1) the unique form of the RCSL policy class, which explicitly depends on the return, and (2) the absence of a straightforward representation of the optimal trajectory distribution. We propose the Return Augmented Decision Transformer (RADT) method, where we augment the return in the source domain by aligning its distribution with that in the target domain. We provide the theoretical analysis demonstrating that the RCSL policy learned from RADT achieves the same level of suboptimality as would be obtained without a dynamics shift. We introduce two practical implementations RADT-DARA and RADT-MV respectively. Extensive experiments conducted on D4RL datasets reveal that our methods generally outperform dynamic programming based methods in off-dynamics RL scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>26 pa...</summary><p>26 pages, 10 tables, 10 figures</p></details> |

Yet, it poses challenges due to substantial parameter size and limited scalability, which is particularly critical in sequential decision-making scenarios where resources are constrained such as in robots and drones with limited computational power. Mamba, a promising new linear-time sequence model, offers performance on par with transformers while delivering substantially fewer parameters on long sequences. As it remains unclear whether Mamba is compatible with trajectory optimization, this work aims to conduct comprehensive experiments to explore the potential of Decision Mamba (dubbed DeMa) in offline RL from the aspect of data structures and essential components with the following insights: (1) Long sequences impose a significant computational burden without contributing to performance improvements since DeMa's focus on sequences diminishes approximately exponentially. Consequently, we introduce a Transformer-like DeMa as opposed to an RNN-like DeMa. (2) For the components of DeMa, we identify the hidden attention mechanism as a critical factor in its success, which can also work well with other residual structures and does not require position embedding. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that our specially designed DeMa is compatible with trajectory optimization and surpasses previous methods, outperforming Decision Transformer (DT) with higher performance while using 30\% fewer parameters in Atari, and exceeding DT with only a quarter of the parameters in MuJoCo.</p></details> | 23 pages, 11 figures |

The language and vision communities have seen remarkable progress toward this trend by scaling up transformer-based models trained on massive datasets, while reinforcement learning (RL) agents still suffer from poor generalization capacity under such paradigms. To tackle this challenge, we propose Meta Decision Transformer (Meta-DT), which leverages the sequential modeling ability of the transformer architecture and robust task representation learning via world model disentanglement to achieve efficient generalization in offline meta-RL. We pretrain a context-aware world model to learn a compact task representation, and inject it as a contextual condition to the causal transformer to guide task-oriented sequence generation. Then, we subtly utilize history trajectories generated by the meta-policy as a self-guided prompt to exploit the architectural inductive bias. We select the trajectory segment that yields the largest prediction error on the pretrained world model to construct the prompt, aiming to encode task-specific information complementary to the world model maximally. Notably, the proposed framework eliminates the requirement of any expert demonstration or domain knowledge at test time. Experimental results on MuJoCo and Meta-World benchmarks across various dataset types show that Meta-DT exhibits superior few and zero-shot generalization capacity compared to strong baselines while being more practical with fewer prerequisites.

In this work, we introduce two novel methods, Decision Mamba (DM) and Hierarchical Decision Mamba (HDM), aimed at enhancing the performance of the Transformer models. Through extensive experimentation across diverse environments such as OpenAI Gym and D4RL, leveraging varying demonstration data sets, we demonstrate the superiority of Mamba models over their Transformer counterparts in a majority of tasks.

In this paper, we introduce a novel approach that combines the Dreamer algorithm's ability to generate anticipatory trajectories with the adaptive learning strengths of the Online Decision Transformer. Our methodology enables parallel training where Dreamer-produced trajectories enhance the contextual decision-making of the transformer, creating a bidirectional enhancement loop. We empirically demonstrate the efficacy of our approach on a suite of challenging benchmarks, achieving notable improvements in sample efficiency and reward maximization over existing methods.

| **[Decision Transformers for Wireless Communications: A New Paradigm of Resource Management](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05199v2)** | 2024-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As the next generation of mobile systems evolves, artificial intelligence (AI) is expected to deeply integrate with wireless communications for resource management in variable environments. In particular, deep reinforcement learning (DRL) is an important tool for addressing stochastic optimization issues of resource allocation. However, DRL has to start each new training process from the beginning once the state and action spaces change, causing low sample efficiency and poor generalization ability. Moreover, each DRL training process may take a large number of epochs to converge, which is unacceptable for time-sensitive scenarios. In this paper, we adopt an alternative AI technology, namely, Decision Transformer (DT), and propose a DT-based adaptive decision architecture for wireless resource management. This architecture innovates through constructing pre-trained models in the cloud and then fine-tuning personalized models at the edges. By leveraging the power of DT models learned over offline datasets, the proposed architecture is expected to achieve rapid convergence with many fewer training epochs and higher performance in new scenarios with different state and action spaces, compared with DRL. We then design DT frameworks for two typical communication scenarios: intelligent reflecting surfaces-aided communications and unmanned aerial vehicle-aided mobile edge computing. Simulations demonstrate that the proposed DT frameworks achieve over $3$-$6$ times speedup in convergence and better performance relative to the classic DRL method, namely, proximal policy optimization.</p></details> |  |
| **[Solving Multi-Goal Robotic Tasks with Decision Transformer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06347v1)** | 2024-10-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Artificial intelligence plays a crucial role in robotics, with reinforcement learning (RL) emerging as one of the most promising approaches for robot control. However, several key challenges hinder its broader application. First, many RL methods rely on online learning, which requires either real-world hardware or advanced simulation environments--both of which can be costly, time-consuming, and impractical. Offline reinforcement learning offers a solution, enabling models to be trained without ongoing access to physical robots or simulations. A second challenge is learning multi-goal tasks, where robots must achieve multiple objectives simultaneously. This adds complexity to the training process, as the model must generalize across different goals. At the same time, transformer architectures have gained significant popularity across various domains, including reinforcement learning. Yet, no existing methods effectively combine offline training, multi-goal learning, and transformer-based architectures. In this paper, we address these challenges by introducing a novel adaptation of the decision transformer architecture for offline multi-goal reinforcement learning in robotics. Our approach integrates goal-specific information into the decision transformer, allowing it to handle complex tasks in an offline setting. To validate our method, we developed a new offline reinforcement learning dataset using the Panda robotic platform in simulation. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that the decision transformer can outperform state-of-the-art online reinforcement learning methods.</p></details> |  |

Through extensive experiments, we compare our approach to a reservation-based intersection management system. Our results show that the Decision Transformer can outperform the training data in terms of total travel time and can be generalized effectively to various scenarios, including noise-induced velocity variations, continuous interaction environments, and different vehicle numbers and road configurations.</p></details> | 7 pages |
| **[Uncertainty-Aware Decision Transformer for Stochastic Driving Environments](https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.16397v3)** | 2024-10-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Offline Reinforcement Learning (RL) enables policy learning without active interactions, making it especially appealing for self-driving tasks. Recent successes of Transformers inspire casting offline RL as sequence modeling, which, however, fails in stochastic environments with incorrect assumptions that identical actions can consistently achieve the same goal. In this paper, we introduce an UNcertainty-awaRE deciSion Transformer (UNREST) for planning in stochastic driving environments without introducing additional transition or complex generative models. Specifically, UNREST estimates uncertainties by conditional mutual information between transitions and returns. Discovering 'uncertainty accumulation' and 'temporal locality' properties of driving environments, we replace the global returns in decision transformers with truncated returns less affected by environments to learn from actual outcomes of actions rather than environment transitions. We also dynamically evaluate uncertainty at inference for cautious planning. Extensive experiments demonstrate UNREST's superior performance in various driving scenarios and the power of our uncertainty estimation strategy.</p></details> |  |
| **[Planning Transformer: Long-Horizon Offline Reinforcement Learning with Planning Tokens](https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09513v1)** | 2024-09-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Supervised learning approaches to offline reinforcement learning, particularly those utilizing the Decision Transformer, have shown effectiveness in continuous environments and for sparse rewards. However, they often struggle with long-horizon tasks due to the high compounding error of auto-regressive models. To overcome this limitation, we go beyond next-token prediction and introduce Planning Tokens, which contain high-level, long time-scale information about the agent's future. Predicting dual time-scale tokens at regular intervals enables our model to use these long-horizon Planning Tokens as a form of implicit planning to guide its low-level policy and reduce compounding error. This architectural modification significantly enhances performance on long-horizon tasks, establishing a new state-of-the-art in complex D4RL environments. Additionally, we demonstrate that Planning Tokens improve the interpretability of the model's policy through the interpretable plan visualisations and attention map.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 5 figures, Submitted to AAAI</p></details> |
